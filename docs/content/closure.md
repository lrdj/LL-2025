# Closure of The Lecture List

Dear all,

With many mixed emotions, we are now officially closing The Lecture List

We've loved sharing information on talks and other events here over the past twenty(!) years

We're incredibly grateful to all our supporters, including everyone who has used the site, from early days through to now

Huge thanks to all of you!

Do get in touch if you have any thoughts or questions. We'd be very happy to discuss the project if anybody is interested in developing something similar

Thank you!
