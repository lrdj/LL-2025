# Contacting the Lecture List

The Lecture List is operated by two volunteers, Dug Falby and Billy Clark. Both Dug and Billy have day jobs so they spend much less time than they would like to working on The Lecture List. Most of that time is spent on server maintenance and event listing moderation.

Unfortunately, this means it sometimes takes us a little while to get back to your emails.

Before you pen your request and click "send" there are a few things you need to keep in mind.

1. By far, most of the emails we receive are to request contact information. We do not hold contact information. Unfortunately, because of the quantity of this type of message, we may not be able to send you a response.

2. Feature requests. Many list users have taken the time to produce helpful, coherent and insightful reports on the performance or interface of the Lecture List system. Unfortunately, we have no development funding, 99% of our resources go into simply feeding the servers. We do appreciate these comments and we retain them just in case Bill Gates does eventually decide to support us.

3. Problems with the accuracy of information. Once again, this is something we simply haven't got the resources to do. The information on The Lecture List is uploaded by organisers and it is their responsibility to maintain it. We don't own, publish or maintain the information, we provide a tool for others to publish their events in one place.
