# About this site

Until now it has been surprisingly difficult to keep up to date with the huge number of challenging and stimulating discussions and debates that take place in this part of the world every day. The Lecture List is designed to make it much easier to keep track of all of this activity.

The Lecture List provides a moderated listing service for lectures around the UK, and enables registered users to keep up to date with talks by their favourite speakers, on their favourite subjects, in their favourite venues, and in their geographical area.

Organisers pass on information using online forms, which is then made available for the public to search through.

Members of the public can browse the site or register for a superior, customised service which makes it easier to pick out the talks that best match their interests. Registered users also receive regular emails keeping them informed abut relevant talks in their area.

Developed and managed by the educator and writer Billy Clark and the designer and internet consultant Dug Falby, The Lecture List will draw attention to the vast range of talks taking place in the country, and make it easier for the public not to miss the talks that most interest them.
