ArtsFems wanted to look behind the art and develop a discourse about the future of women’s work in this area.\r\n\r\nSpeaking are Rachael House, co-curator and director of Space Station Sixty-Five in Peckham; Rosa Bennathan, co-editor of Bad Housekeeping, a feminist online magazine; and Rosalind Davis, curator and co-founder of Zeitgeist Arts Projects, designed to support ambitious artists.\r\n\r\nThe discussion will be opened up to the floor to enable you to ask questions to the panel and voice your own opinions. \r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": null, "added": "2014-03-11T14:47:48", "slug": "34254f4856d4d6e1", "speakers": [{"id": 13569, "name": "Rachael House", "slug": "rachael-house"}, {"id": 14546, "name": "Rosa Bennathan", "slug": "rosa-bennathan"}, {"id": 11120, "name": "Miss Rosalind Davis", "slug": "miss-rosalind-davis"}], "topics": [{"id": 2490, "name": "feminism", "path": "/society/gender/feminism/feminism"}, {"id": 3413, "name": "feminism", "path": "/politics/feminism/womenshistory/feminism"}, {"id": 3642, "name": "womeninart", "path": "/arts/society/women/womeninart"}], "supercategory": "society", "venue": {"id": 2783, "name": "Housmans Bookshop", "slug": "housmans-bookshop", "city": "London", "postcode": "N1 9DX"}, "organizer": {"id": 2783, "name": "Housmans Bookshop", "slug": "housmans-bookshop"}, "date": "2014-03-19", "dates": [{"id": 14029, "from_date": "2014-03-19", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "19:00:00", "ticket_cost": "Free entry", "ticket_info": null, "additional_info": "HOW TO FIND US:\r\nWe're very easy to find - just a two minute walk from King's Cross/St.Pancras terminals.

It is true to say that Japanese society often embraces such images of itself, and some Japanese artists, such as Takashi Murakami and Kaikai Kiki, respond to, or exploit, these trends, making them even more widespread. Yet is this the whole story? Does this kind of work actually represent the most significant and powerful art being made in Japan today?\r\n\r\nDavid Elliott, founding director of the Mori Art Museum, Tokyo, who spent five years in Japan, thinks not. He sees an intensely reflective, self-critical, controversial, even political, spirit within contemporary Japanese art that is less easy to appreciate than the stereotypes but more rewarding to grasp. It was this which led him to curate the successful exhibition Bye, Bye Kitty!!! – Between Heaven and Hell in Contemporary Japanese Art held at the Japan Society in New York earlier this year. This fascinating exhibition concentrated on diverse work by talented young and middle generation Japanese artists, many of whom have not yet been well enough represented on the international art scene.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, David Elliott will offer an overview of this exhibition and the artists he chose for it, mapping them in the social context of modern and contemporary Japan. Complementing his talk will be a discussion with sociologist and Japanese contemporary art specialist Adrian Favell. Together they will further explore how significant the exhibition is today, reflecting on Japanese aesthetics, social realities and global reactions.\r\n\r\nThis event is organised in collaboration with TrAIN Research Centre.", "additional_info": null, "duration": 120, "image_id": 1591, "added": "2011-09-26T14:32:27", "slug": "bye-bye-kitty", "speakers": [{"id": 8739, "name": "Mr David Elliott", "slug": "mr-david-elliott"}, {"id": 11493, "name": "Professor Adrian Favell", "slug": "professor-adrian-favell"}], "topics": [{"id": 308, "name": "modern", "path": "/arts/art/modern"}, {"id": 804, "name": "contemporaryart", "path": "/arts/art/contemporaryart"}, {"id": 804, "name": "contemporaryart", "path": "/arts/art/contemporaryart"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 2555, "name": "The Banqueting Hall", "slug": "the-banqueting-hall", "city": "London", "postcode": "SW1P 4JU"}, "organizer": {"id": 1853, "name": "The Japan Foundation", "slug": "the-japan-foundation"}, "date": "2011-10-17", "dates": [{"id": 10641, "from_date": "2011-10-17", "to_date": "2011-10-17", "time": "18:15:00", "ticket_cost": "Free, booking essential", "ticket_info": "This event is free to attend but booking is essential.

The overall theme of the 3 lectures is Economics after the Crisis. \r\n\r\nAmid the financial crash there was much talk of a crisis of capitalism and the need for a revolution in economics. Two years on much work is in hand to reform global financial regulation, but it is not clear that the crisis will produce change as radical as initially supposed. Adair Turner will argue, however, that the crisis should provoke us to think deeply about the conventional wisdom of the last several decades in which economic growth maximisation is the clear objective of economic policy, and market liberalisation, including in financial markets, the universally applicable means. Against this instrumental justification of markets and resulting inequality, Adair Turner will advance a case for economic freedom as an end in itself but one which needs to be balanced with other desirable ends. This implies the need for the discipline of economics to consider a wide range of behavioural, historical and philosophical issues, eschewing a narrow focus on mathematical precision. Lord Turner will contrast his conclusions with those Lionel Robbins reached in his famous 1932 \"Essay on the Nature and Significance of Economic Science\". \r\n\r\nAdair Turner is chairman of the Financial Services Authority, the Climate Change Committee and the Overseas Development Institute. He is also chair of the Working Party of the G20 Financial Stability Board reporting to the G20 Summit in November 2010 and a visiting professor at LSE. \r\n\r\nSubsequent lectures are entitled Market Efficiency and Rationality: Why Financial Markets are Different (12 October) and Economic Freedom and Public Policy: Economics as a Moral Discipline (13 October). \r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 732, "added": "2010-09-13T10:00:10", "slug": "economic-growth-human-welfare-and-inequality", "speakers": [{"id": 5300, "name": "Lord Adair Turner", "slug": "lord-adair-turner"}], "topics": [{"id": 1640, "name": "economy", "path": "/society/media/news/economy"}, {"id": 1239, "name": "economics", "path": "/politics/economics/latinamerica/economics"}, {"id": 415, "name": "economics", "path": "/society/politics/economics"}, {"id": 1510, "name": "economy", "path": "/business/economy"}], "supercategory": "society", "venue": {"id": 2131, "name": "Old Theatre", "slug": "old-theatre", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC2A 2AE"}, "organizer": {"id": 1287, "name": "London School of Economics & Political Science", "slug": "london-school-of-economics-political-science"}, "date": "2010-10-11", "dates": [{"id": 9145, "from_date": "2010-10-11", "to_date": "2010-10-11", "time": "18:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": "This event is free and open to all with no ticket required.

The Becoming aspect will involve learning how meditation can help us to awaken to the evolutionary impulse that is the very life force within us. \r\n\r\nThe Being and Becoming Day will also give you a taste of the remarkable potentials that emerged in the recent retreat in Tuscany. If you were at the retreat, it will be an opportunity to immerse yourself once again in the powerful field of spiritual creativity and communion that was created among the participants and that is always - and miraculously - moving forward.

The event is a follow-up to the two previous events held on 22 May 2008 and 23 October 2008. Like its predecessors, the symposium\r\nwill again bring together an international group of leading theoreticians and reflective practitioners in the field of “practice-based research in art and design”.\r\n\r\nWhile in Europe the discussion is comparatively young and has evolved in recent years mainly as an outcome of the Bologna reforms, practice-based art and design research in the UK has more than a decade of experience. It is one aim of the symposium to interlink these different backgrounds. Another aim is to map the terrain of the diverse approaches to practice-based research and discuss the\r\ndifferent philosophical and art theoretical backgrounds which inform the different models.\r\n\r\nWhat is the difference between research-based art and art-based\r\nresearch? Why would an artist want to become a researcher? Does the artist researcher conflict with the notion of artistic autonomy? What does the epistemological shift from art production to knowledge\r\nproduction imply for the actors involved in the field? What are the specificities and styles of artistic knowledge production? How can they become the topics of a research practice that can be regarded as both scientifically and artistically based? What are the goals of such research? What is the desired outcome? These are just some of the\r\nquestions which will be explored at this event.\r\n\r\nThe framework of the “practice-based research in art and design” is still very open and integrative. It allows the artist researcher to develop his/her own methodology within a research process which is highly individual and dependent on the specific subject matter.\r\nEntering the arena of ongoing discussion, negotiation and re-adjustment and engaging in the discourse about epistemology and\r\nmethodology essentially contributes to constituting this freedom.\r\n\r\nSpeakers:\r\n\r\n* Prof Dr Tom Holert (Art historian, Academy of Fine Art Vienna)\r\n* Dr Sophia Lycouris, artist/ researcher (Edinburgh College of Art)\r\n* Prof Hinrich Sachs (artist, Royal University College of Fine Arts Stockholm)\r\n* Prof Dr Gavin Renwick, artist/researcher (Dundee University)\r\n\r\nChair: Dr Ken Neil, artist/researcher (Glasgow School of Art)\r\nOrganised by: PhD Forum DoJ, Lindsay Brown and Cornelia Sollfrank\r\n\r\nLocation: Dundee Contemporary Arts · Nethergate 152 · Dundee DD1 4DX   · Meeting Room\r\n\r\nThe event is free, but advance booking is required: 01382-909900\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTom Holert: Research vs. Research?\r\n\r\nThe debate on practice-led PhDs and related issues is marked by numerous attempts to reach a working definition of 'research' in the visual arts. To distinguish research that informs artistic practice  (by gathering knowledge and collecting material and immaterial references relevant to a particular project) from research that pursues the generation of new knowledge in the realm of practice itself, appears to be one of the more pressing issues in claiming legitimacy for artistic research as such. This endeavour, that prioritises the research-through-practice approach, seems to be as much in accordance with dominant ideas of scientificity and scholarship as in contradiction to notions of research that put an emphasis on social and political agendas of collaborative, self- organized forms of knowledge acquisition and knowledge production within and outside of the disciplinary boundaries of the visual arts, for instance in the tradition of 'militant investigations'.\r\n\r\nElaborating this line of thought, my contribution will try to map some antagonisms of the current discourse on artistic research.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHinrich Sachs: The Coming 200 Years of Artistic Autonomy\r\n\r\nOne of the specifics of academic research is its 'comprehensibility', and it is easy to recognise the central role that language plays in this. If one were to accept this tenet as fundamental, requiring linguistic reconstruction of processes and presupposing the linguistic preparation and planning of processes, it is the prospective, written development of issues that leads the artist straight into an obvious conflict with the older concept of the autonomy of art.\r\n\r\nStarting from this point, the talk briefly reconstructs the development and significance that the notion of the autonomy of art occupies within the European context of the history of ideas. In the following, various loose forms of the way 'autonomy' is understood and used today are identified. On the one hand artists, gallerists and collectors share a nostalgic view, which is dismissed on the other hand by socially engaged artists and public commissioners, while at the same time it is co-opted under the auspices of today's academia and its research terminology. Perhaps only a rejection of all these uses might be able to point towards the possibilities of a contemporary autonomous artistic practice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSophia Lycouris: Towards new metaphors for the relationship between theory and practice in practice-based research\r\n\r\nIn a dialogue with Michel Foucault, Gilles Deleuze suggested that the relationship between theory and practice can be understood as \"a system of relays within a larger sphere, within a multiplicity of parts that are both theoretical and practical\" (in Foucault 1977, 206). This was a principle and a metaphor I chose to use in the mid 90s, in order to both explain and justify the processes of my research for a PhD in movement improvisation, which was one of the first practice-based PhDs in dance in the UK. These processes were totally driven by my approach to artistic practice, and therefore it is not surprising that I treated the development of this research as a process of (artistic) composition and visualised the outcome as a piece of choreography, according to my own understanding of this term and how this understanding has been driving my artistic practice for more than twenty years.\r\n\r\nAlthough it was not necessary to be explicit about the kinds of knowledge and processes of knowledge production which were assumed and implied by my approach at the time, these are issues which have become increasingly important since then. To acknowledge the political relevance of such debates and take into account the emphasis on the relationship between academic research and economic development (at least within the European context), it is crucial to understand the character of power relationships operating between different groups with relatively conflicting interests. Despite my intense involvement with the academy in the recent years, the ways in which I respond, make choices and act as an academic, continue to be informed by what I would call an â€˜artistic visionâ€™. An important aspect of this vision is to facilitate the development of links between artistic practice and academic research, in order to demonstrate the kinds of insight that artistic practice can offer to academic research. To work towards this aim in the continuously shifting current landscape, I need to engage with debates about the legitimisation of knowledge and alternative modes of knowledge production, become more specific about my notion of academic research as (artistic) composition, and identify/develop new principles and metaphors about the relationship between theory and practice in practice-based research, of course without falling into the trap of formalisation.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor further information about the event including abstracts and biographies please visithttp://www.vrc.dundee.ac.uk/Research/PhD_forum_upcoming_events.html", "additional_info": null, "duration": 60, "image_id": null, "added": "2009-04-29T16:08:54", "slug": "5e083e5c95c58296", "speakers": [{"id": 8336, "name": "prof hinrich sachs", "slug": "prof-hinrich-sachs"}, {"id": 8335, "name": "prof tom holert", "slug": "prof-tom-holert"}, {"id": 8337, "name": "dr sophia lycouris", "slug": "dr-sophia-lycouris"}, {"id": 8338, "name": "prof dr gavin renwick", "slug": "prof-dr-gavin-renwick"}], "topics": [{"id": 162, "name": "research", "path": "/science/research"}], "supercategory": "science", "venue": {"id": 1940, "name": "artwarez", "slug": "artwarez", "city": "Internet", "postcode": ""}, "organizer": {"id": 1940, "name": "artwarez", "slug": "artwarez"}, "date": "2009-05-08", "dates": [{"id": 7024, "from_date": "2009-05-08", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "10:30:00", "ticket_cost": "free", "ticket_info": null, "additional_info": null, "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 1940, "name": "artwarez", "slug": "artwarez", "city": "Internet", "postcode": ""}, "organizer": {"id": 1940, "name": "artwarez", "slug": "artwarez"}}]}, {"id": 6608, "title": "Druids and Their Magic in Early Ireland", "synopsis": "Clouds, Stars, Ogham and Bull's Blood.

One key to the puzzle might be provided by the raised incidence of exceptional talent in individuals with autism. A Discussion Meeting on Autism and Talent was organised under the joint auspices of the British Academy and Royal Society and held in September 2008. Contributors from different disciplines explored aspects ranging from the prevalence and nature of exceptional talent and its basis in the brain, to the cognitive theories currently trying to explain the origin of talent, to the representation of talent and autism in biography and fiction. The outcome of this meeting showed some remarkable convergence of ideas, for instance, the possibility that a detail-focused processing style may predispose to talent. However, it is also clear that many of the most important questions still remain open.  Are great artists fundamentally different from the rest of us? Is talent mainly nature or nurture? Is there a price to pay for exceptional ability in one domain?

There his illustrious friendship group included Arthur Bliss, Herbert Howells and Arthur Benjamin; a talented generation taught by Sir Charles Villiers Stanford, Sir Hubert Parry and Ralph Vaughan Williams. Along with many of his contemporaries, studies were interrupted by war service, and he served in France from 1915 - 1917, before being discharged with shellshock, and the lingering effects of a gas attack. He had struggled to maintain mental stability before the war, suffering from 'nerves' and 'neurasthenia', and the years immediately succeeding the armistice saw both prodigious creativity, and increasing illness; culminating in his committal to an asylum in 1922. He was never to be released from institutions, but his work continued for a surprising length of time, despite the dual disabilities of mental deterioration and lack of a critical audience. Some of his best-known war poetry was written retrospectively from within the asylum, and his mature work is characterised by his preoccupation with rewriting his war experiences, and his lifelong passion for the beauty of his home county. Described at the Royal College as 'the English Schubert', his voluminous song settings display a uniquely sensitive relationship to their texts. His poetry offers highly original, often idiosyncratic insights into the appreciation of natural beauty, the experience of war, and the creative interpretation of suffering.\r\n\r\nThere remains a wealth of unpublished material by Gurney, about which much remains to be said.  Gurney was almost unique in writing both poetry and music, and thus provides a rich opportunity for interdisciplinary discussion. This conference aims to examine both sides of his output in equal measure, establishing a dialogue between the two, whilst placing his work against the backdrop of the early twentieth century, war and the asylum.\r\n\r\nThe weekend will include papers given by international delegates, addressing many issues relevant to Gurney's life and work, poetry readings, a formal dinner, and a recital of Gurney and other English song by tenor Andrew Kennedy (Radio 3 New Generation Young Artist and winner BBC Singer of the World Song Prize) including previously unheard and unpublished works by both Gurney and his contemporary W. Denis Browne.
