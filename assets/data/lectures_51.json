At its heart lies the exhortation to \"know thyself\" which was said to be inscribed above the entrance to the Sanctuary at Delphi in which the oracle of Apollo was given to those who sought to answer life's questions.\r\n\r\nIn this session we’ll read a passage from the dialogue and consider the reasons why Plato and his tradition considered the Delphic command to be so important. Various questions will, no doubt, be raised: What does it mean to know the self? Is it even possible to know the self? What effect does self-knowledge have on the rest of one’s knowledge? What kind of being is it that must work at knowing the self? Does the attempt to know the self change the direction of life?\r\n\r\nNo previous experience of formal philosophy is required.\r\n\r\nEntrance in free, but donations between £2-4 will be welcomed.\r\n\r\nA PDF download of the extract we will be reading is available on our website together with further details of this and other Prometheus Trust's activities: www.prometheustrust.co.uk (the PDF is on the \"Bristol Wednesday evenings\" page.", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 2293, "added": "2018-10-04T23:21:03", "slug": "9857adece8740b27", "speakers": [{"id": 3573, "name": "  Tim Addey", "slug": "tim-addey"}], "topics": [{"id": 365, "name": "platonism", "path": "/arts/philosophy/platonism"}, {"id": 2388, "name": "philosophy", "path": "/arts/literature/philosophy/philosophy"}, {"id": 1822, "name": "philosophy", "path": "/academic/religion/religion/philosophy"}, {"id": 316, "name": "philosophy", "path": "/arts/art/philosophy"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 3463, "name": "Hydra Books", "slug": "hydra-books", "city": "Bristol", "postcode": "BS2 0EZ"}, "organizer": {"id": 2041, "name": "The Prometheus Trust", "slug": "the-prometheus-trust"}, "date": "2018-10-17", "dates": [{"id": 16848, "from_date": "2018-10-17", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "19:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Donation", "ticket_info": null, "additional_info": null, "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 3463, "name": "Hydra Books", "slug": "hydra-books", "city": "Bristol", "postcode": "BS2 0EZ"}, "organizer": {"id": 2041, "name": "The Prometheus Trust", "slug": "the-prometheus-trust"}}]}, {"id": 16196, "title": "Is fake information destroying democracy?", "synopsis": "Thomas Jefferson once observed that “information is the currency of democracy.” ", "keywords": "humanism, fake news", "body": "If this is right, what happens when that currency is corrupted by bad information — alternative facts, fake news, conspiracy theories and pseudo-science? This is the question that Mike Flood will pose in his talk: he will argue that these imposters confuse and mislead the public; they harm people and destroy reputations, sometimes lives; and they can incite suspicion, fear and anger, which undermines social cohesion, democracy and the rule of law. When a society cannot tell fact from fantasy, and politicians and mainstream institutions are no longer trusted, there is a serious risk of descent into chaos.\r\n\r\nToday’s post truth world seems to be accelerating down this path — facts and opinions have become interchangeable, evidence and reasoned analysis are routinely dismissed, and experts are reviled and ridiculed; and society has become more intolerant, fractious and polarised, with racialism and hate crime on the rise. We have also seen foreign interference in domestic affairs, and a haemorrhaging of trust in traditional sources of information and authority.\r\n\r\nMike will explore the possible contribution that social media may be playing in this collapse — nearly 4 billion people today have access to the Internet, and three quarters of them are on social media; he will also review the different approaches that are being pursued to neutralise or eliminate the threat and speculate on their likely success.\r\n\r\nMike Flood has many years’ experience in public education. He has spent much of the last year researching into fake news and misinformation and launched Critical Information (in Jan 2017) not only to help foster better public understanding of the scale and nature of the threat, but also to promote media awareness. The intention is not to compete with organisations and statutory bodies working to tackle the problem rather to complement their efforts by helping to explain and publicise their work.

She was Almina, Countess of Carnarvon, widow of the 5th Earl of Carnarvon, the aristocrat-adventurer who, with sidekick Howard Carter, discovered and emptied the tomb of Tutankhamun in Egypt&#8223;s Valley of the Kings, and whose untimely death is believed by many to be evidence of a curse of the pharaohs. But the 5th Countess of Carnarvon was much more than the legendry Earl&#8223;s wife. Almina was a well-known figure in her own right in London society: one of the last great eccentric aristocrats of the 19th and 20th centuries; a pioneer in nursing; and quite possibly a descendent of one of the richest, most powerful families in European history, and the mother of a son whose true bloodline may show that the family still have an additional ancestor to declare. What follows is the as yet untold story of a daughter, a wife, a mother, a lady, a Countess, and a long and colourful life.\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 120, "image_id": 1953, "added": "2015-07-20T10:41:12", "slug": "30d972dc88c5e929", "speakers": [{"id": 13766, "name": "Mr William  Cross", "slug": "mr-william-cross"}], "topics": [{"id": 3272, "name": "life", "path": "/arts/literature/writing/life"}, {"id": 1840, "name": "life", "path": "/arts/philosophy/life"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 3205, "name": "Gwent NHS Retirement Fellowship Club", "slug": "gwent-nhs-retirement-fellowship-club", "city": "Cwmbran, Gwent ", "postcode": "NP44 2BZ"}, "organizer": {"id": 2861, "name": "William Cross, FSA Scot", "slug": "william-cross-fsa-scot"}, "date": "2015-07-20", "dates": [{"id": 15377, "from_date": "2015-07-20", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "13:00:00", "ticket_cost": "Members Only", "ticket_info": "Members and Guests Only.", "additional_info": "William Cross, FSA Scot is the author of FIVE books featuring the life and times of the Carnarvons of Highclere Castle, the backdrop to TV's Downton Abbey", "members_only": "Yes", "members_info": "Members ( and guests) only previously employed in the NHS in Gwent", "venue": {"id": 3205, "name": "Gwent NHS Retirement Fellowship Club", "slug": "gwent-nhs-retirement-fellowship-club", "city": "Cwmbran, Gwent ", "postcode": "NP44 2BZ"}, "organizer": {"id": 2861, "name": "William Cross, FSA Scot", "slug": "william-cross-fsa-scot"}}]}, {"id": 14808, "title": "Shoah, Holocaust, Churbn and More: On the Emergence of Names for the Lethal Nazi Anti-Jewish Campaig", "synopsis": "This event provides a rare opportunity to hear Professor Dan Michman discuss a key aspect of our understanding of the Holocaust.", "keywords": "Holocaust, history, refugees, university, genocide, library, Museums, war, politics, refugees", "body": "This event provides a rare opportunity to hear Professor Dan Michman discuss a key aspect of our understanding of the Holocaust. Why do we nowadays use the terms ‚Holocaust‘ and ‚Shoah‘, although a host of other terms were used or proposed both initially and later on? What do these terms mean, where did they originate, and what do they designate? Are they synonyms or do their semantic fields differ? Are they legitimate or not? Why is there a competition between them (and with others)? And what have literature and the film industry to do with their dissemination? In short: do we indeed know what we mean when we speak about ‚the Holocaust‘? In this talk an attempt will be made to understand the complicated links between discourses of survivors and scholars, semantic changes, the impact of historical processes, ideological stances on the use of terminology – and the consequences regarding historical interpretation.\r\n\r\nDan Michman is Professor of Modern Jewish History and Chair of the Finkler Institute of Holocaust Research at Bar-Ilan University, Ramat-Gan and also serves as Head of the International Institute of Holocaust Research and Incumbent of the John Najmann Chair in Holocaust Studies at Yad Vashem.

Join us for this special Dyslexia Awareness Week event with the BDA to celebrate the achievements of two brilliant dyslexic authors and encourage children to embrace their creative side.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTen per cent of the population is estimated to be dyslexic, four per cent severely so. Many people with dyslexia, whether adults or children, are unable to fulfil their potential as a large percentage of the population don't understand what dyslexia is and how to support those with it. The vision of the BDA is to create a dyslexia friendly society that listens to and supports people with dyslexia.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nDyslexia Awareness Week runs from November 3 to November 9 2014 and is an annual event that aims at not just raising awareness, but also showcasing the amazing achievements that people with dyslexia have made. www.bdadyslexia.org.uk\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTom McLaughlin is an author and illustrator.

What had been a minor regional school achieved international prominence and influenced the future of European art in general for centuries. Central to this achievement was the genius of a succession of painters from Giovanni Bellini and his brother Gentile, Carpaccio, Giorgione, to the great Titian and his younger contemporaries Tintoretto and Veronese. These painters worked in a city undergoing crisis and change: the decline of its maritime empire, the reduction of its monopoly of trade with the East, its near destruction as a state in the early sixteenth century, and the religious turmoil engendered by the Reformation and the reaction of the Roman Church to it. Governed by an oligarchy of merchant nobles who elected a Doge, Venice remained politically stable throughout this turbulent period and continued to flourish economically. The state, the lay confraternities (called scuole) and private individuals provided sufficient patronage and support for a brilliant school of painting to develop in both secular and religious art. The cultural context and history of this school will be studied in eight lectures, followed by a full-day visit to the National Gallery to consider first-hand its outstanding collection of Venetian renaissance paintings.\r\n \r\n\r\n", "keywords": "arts, art, history, Renaissance Venice, Giovanni Bellini, Antonello da Messina, 'Sacra Conversazione', Titian, public paintings, eligious paintings", "body": "Our image of renaissance Venice is largely shaped by the picture of it to be found in the paintings commissioned by the lay confraternities or 'Scuole'.

They spent a lot on their grand meeting houses and the narrative canvasses inside them depicting the lives and deeds of their patron saints or the miracles of their principal relics. Gentile Bellini and others painted the 'Miracle of the Cross' cycle for the Scuola Grande of San Giovanni Evangelista while Tintoretto was later to make the Scuola Grande of San Rocco his pictorial monument.

Simon Baron-Cohen, expert in autism and developmental psychopathology, has always wanted to isolate and understand the factors that cause people to treat others as if they were mere objects. In this book he proposes a radical shift, turning the focus away from evil and on to the central factor, empathy. Unlike the concept of evil, he argues, empathy has real explanatory power.\r\nPutting empathy under the microscope he explores four new ideas: firstly, that we all lie somewhere on an empathy spectrum, from high to low, from six degrees to zero degrees. Secondly that, deep within the brain lies the 'empathy circuit'. How this circuit functions determines where we lie on the empathy spectrum. Thirdly, that empathy is not only something we learn but that there are also genes associated with empathy. And fourthly, while a lack of empathy leads to mostly negative results, is it always negative?  \r\n\r\nSimon Baron-Cohen is Professor at Cambridge University in the fields of psychology and psychiatry. He is also the Director of Cambridge's internationally-renowned Autism Research Centre.

This talk aims to explore the potential risk weighed against the great benefits in the use of safe and effective cognitive enhancing drugs to many sectors of society, including the ageing population and people with neuropsychiatric disorders and brain injury.\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": null, "added": "2010-01-06T12:14:29", "slug": "b453d9bf00d1329c", "speakers": [{"id": 6601, "name": "Prof Barbara Sahakian", "slug": "prof-barbara-sahakian"}], "topics": [{"id": 376, "name": "cognition", "path": "/science/philosophy/cognition"}, {"id": 866, "name": "drugs", "path": "/society/health/drugs"}, {"id": 928, "name": "neuroscience", "path": "/science/publicunderstandingofscience/neuroscience"}, {"id": 147, "name": "brain", "path": "/science/biology/brain"}], "supercategory": "science", "venue": {"id": 1729, "name": "The Royal Institution", "slug": "the-royal-institution", "city": "London", "postcode": "W1S 4BS"}, "organizer": {"id": 1729, "name": "The Royal Institution", "slug": "the-royal-institution"}, "date": "2010-02-22", "dates": [{"id": 7976, "from_date": "2010-02-22", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "19:00:00", "ticket_cost": "Tickets £8 standard, £6 concessions, £4 Ri Members", "ticket_info": "For more information visit www.rigb.org or call the Events Team on 020 7409 2992 9.00am-5.00pm Monday to Friday", "additional_info": null, "members_only": "No", "members_info": "To become a member of the Ri please visit www.rigb.org/membership or call 020 7670 2919.", "venue": {"id": 1729, "name": "The Royal Institution", "slug": "the-royal-institution", "city": "London", "postcode": "W1S 4BS"}, "organizer": {"id": 1729, "name": "The Royal Institution", "slug": "the-royal-institution"}}]}, {"id": 7575, "title": "The Russo-Turkish War, 1875-1878", "synopsis": "Taking a look at the decay of the Ottoman Empire and the political movements that would end in WWI.", "keywords": "History, War, Conflict, Turkey, Russia, 19th Century", "body": "This is the least-known of the wars discussed in this series of lectures, yet it was of crucial importance for Europe.

Within both pragmatic stylistics and linguistic pragmatics, however, attention has focused more on the inferences of addressees or audiences than on the inferences of communicators. This paper explores some of the ways in which focusing on the inferences of writers can help us to understand the processes of writers and the processes of readers.\r\n\r\nIn most cases, the inferences made by communicators are more complex than those made by addressees. Communicators need to make assumptions not only about which assumptions will be manifest to addressees but also about what addressees will do when presented with the evidence provided by their utterances. Where audiences are relatively large or diverse, the inferences which speakers and writers need to make are even more complex.\r\n\r\nThe approach outlined here takes as its starting point a model which treats the processes of communicators and addressees separately. It also aims to take seriously the view that meanings are products of the interaction between communicators and addressees, exploring different ways in which interaction takes place in speech and writing and in different modes more generally.\r\n\r\nThe paper reports classroom activities which help students to understand the inferences writers make and to develop their writing in any genre. The classroom work reported looks at a wide range of genres, including text messages, emails, formal and informal letters, academic essays, business and technical writing, poetry, drama and prose fiction. \r\n\r\nThe conclusion is that focusing on the inferences of writers can help us to understand the texts they produce. It can also help writers to develop their own writing and teachers to develop materials which help students to develop their own writing.\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 917, "added": "2009-07-27T15:12:02", "slug": "e8b7b94d5aec1b12", "speakers": [{"id": 282, "name": "Dr. Billy Clark", "slug": "dr-billy-clark"}], "topics": [{"id": 5, "name": "pragmatics", "path": "/academic/arts/linguistics/pragmatics"}, {"id": 1333, "name": "linguistics", "path": "/academic/arts/linguistics/linguistics"}, {"id": 862, "name": "language", "path": "/academic/arts/english/language"}, {"id": 433, "name": "writing", "path": "/arts/literature/writing"}], "supercategory": "academic", "venue": {"id": 928, "name": "English, Middlesex University", "slug": "english-middlesex-university", "city": "London", "postcode": "NW4 4BT"}, "organizer": {"id": 928, "name": "English, Middlesex University", "slug": "english-middlesex-university"}, "date": "2010-03-05", "dates": [{"id": 7208, "from_date": "2010-03-05", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "14:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": null, "additional_info": "Room tbc.

As a result of this process, the exercise of authority is now carried out increasingly at trans-, inter-, and supra-national levels. This poses a fundamental question for political thought. Do the new circumstances in which states operate require a reassessment of our understanding of distributive justice? In this series of talks, Andrea Sangiovanni will argue for three interconnected claims. First, that facts about political and social institutions should affect not only the implementation of principles of justice but also, and more controversially, their content, scope, and grounds. Second, that equality as a demand of justice only applies among citizens and residents of a state. This is not because citizens and residents share a collective identity, or because they are subject to the same coercive power, but because they share in the mutual provision of the collective goods necessary for a flourishing life. Equality is therefore best understood as a demand of reciprocity. Third, this reciprocity-based conception of distributive justice can be extended to the inter-, trans-, and supra-national level. Despite the fact that equality is a demand of justice only among citizens and residents of a state, this does not imply that we have no obligations of distributive justice beyond the state. It only implies that these will be different in both form and content from those we have at the domestic level. The third claim is developed in the institutional context of the European Union.", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": null, "added": "2008-10-01T13:51:39", "slug": "re-visions-international-distributive-justice-reciprocity-and-the-european-union", "speakers": [{"id": 7498, "name": "Dr Andrea Sangiovanni", "slug": "dr-andrea-sangiovanni"}], "topics": [{"id": 1474, "name": "culture", "path": "/academic/society/culture/culture"}, {"id": 687, "name": "society", "path": "/arts/architecture/planning/society"}, {"id": 1024, "name": "society", "path": "/arts/literature/french/society"}, {"id": 123, "name": "mobility", "path": "/society/urbanisation/planning/mobility"}, {"id": 1516, "name": "law", "path": "/politics/law"}, {"id": 428, "name": "europe", "path": "/politics/europe"}, {"id": 1169, "name": "democracy", "path": "/politics/democracy"}, {"id": 1119, "name": "humanrights", "path": "/politics/humanrights"}, {"id": 1014, "name": "immigration", "path": "/politics/immigration"}], "supercategory": "academic", "venue": {"id": 1359, "name": "Room G108, 20 Kingsway, LSE", "slug": "room-g108-20-kingsway-lse", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC2A 2AE"}, "organizer": {"id": 1075, "name": "Forum for European Philosophy, LSE", "slug": "forum-for-european-philosophy-lse"}, "date": "2008-10-21", "dates": [{"id": 6235, "from_date": "2008-10-21", "to_date": "2008-10-21", "time": "18:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": null, "additional_info": "This event is free and open to all, without registration\r\n\r\nIt will take place in Room G108, 20 Kingsway, LSE\r\n\r\nFor further information on the Forum for European Philosophy, visit our website ar www.philosophy-forum.org", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 1359, "name": "Room G108, 20 Kingsway, LSE", "slug": "room-g108-20-kingsway-lse", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC2A 2AE"}, "organizer": {"id": 1075, "name": "Forum for European Philosophy, LSE", "slug": "forum-for-european-philosophy-lse"}}]}, {"id": 5721, "title": "Negotiating a new international response to Climate Change: the prospects for COP-15 in Copenhagen 2", "synopsis": "FT Business – LSE European Institute The Future of Europe lecture series with the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment", "keywords": "CLIMATE CHANGE\r\nDEVELOPMENT\r\nGOVERNMENT", "body": "Climate change is one of the most complex global challenges the world currently faces.

Above all, the presence of the\r\nphotographs presents the need to re-visit the influence of Algeria, as a colony and\r\na post-colony, on the formation of French social theory. The neglect of colonial\r\ncontexts upon theoretical perspectives that continue to impress huge influence upon\r\nour contemporary tools of analysis is indicative of the ways in which histories of\r\nsocial and political thought have eclipsed particular landscapes and formations in\r\nthe writing process.", "additional_info": null, "duration": 120, "image_id": null, "added": "2006-11-08T15:45:09", "slug": "0278769c83b933fc", "speakers": [], "topics": [], "supercategory": "academic", "venue": {"id": 1186, "name": "Sociology at Goldsmiths' Colllege", "slug": "sociology-at-goldsmiths-colllege", "city": "LONDON", "postcode": "SE14 6NW"}, "organizer": {"id": 1186, "name": "Sociology at Goldsmiths' Colllege", "slug": "sociology-at-goldsmiths-colllege"}, "date": "2006-11-09", "dates": [{"id": 3834, "from_date": "2006-11-09", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "18:00:00", "ticket_cost": "FREE", "ticket_info": "Please register to reserve a place - email Kimberly Keith sop01kk@gold.ac.uk", "additional_info": "3.30 - 6.00 Film Screening of Sociology as a Combat Sport\r\n6.00 - 8.00 Drinks and Reception \r\nExhibition 'Pierre Bourdieu in Algeria: testimonies of Uprooting' Oct 2006 - May 2007\r\nKingsway Corridor, Richard Hoggart Building, Goldsmiths, London University.\r\n", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 1186, "name": "Sociology at Goldsmiths' Colllege", "slug": "sociology-at-goldsmiths-colllege", "city": "LONDON", "postcode": "SE14 6NW"}, "organizer": {"id": 1186, "name": "Sociology at Goldsmiths' Colllege", "slug": "sociology-at-goldsmiths-colllege"}}]}, {"id": 3558, "title": "Conserving Antarctica’s Past, Present and Future", "synopsis": "Join us to discuss the controversies surrounding endeavours past, present and future in Antarctica, with an expert panel.", "keywords": "Conservation\r\nAntarctica\r\nScience\r\nEnvironment\r\nExploration\r\nHeritage\r\nMuseum", "body": "The heroic age of exploration was a unique time of discovery, producing a major scientific and cultural legacy.

While intellectual life in Europe floundered in the Dark Ages, Baghdad, Cairo and Cordova were the intellectual centres of the world. Scholars founded great centres of learning with the ambition of translating and studying as much as possible of what remained of classical Greek knowledge. The Islamic scientific tradition was richer and more profound and had more complex relations to other cultures than we previously thought. Those in the Muslim world were not merely translators and transmitters of Greek knowledge, but developed the science they received from the Greek; revising it, adding to it, disputing it and correcting it.

This new exhibition at Hackney Museum, explores the idioms and phrases we use everyday to describe what is happening to us.  Hackney Museum’s staff have been working with local ESOL and community groups to collect phrases from some of the 100 languages that are spoken in Hackney today.  The exhibition has been designed for families to share their language experiences through video, animations, text, stories and interactives including a giant jigsaw and an art table.  Most importantly the exhibition also includes a display where you can add your own phrase or idiom, from English or your home language.\r\n\r\nThroughout the exhibition there will be a series of events that explore language in Hackney today, from the Jewish roots of Cockney rhyming slang to the Yoruba and English influences on a contemporary rap artist. There is also a series of events for families including an opportunity to add to the computer animation of the phrases.
