But until now, the essays collected here, originally published in obscure journals and political magazines, have been largely unavailable to the broad readership to which they are so naturally suited. \r\n\r\n The opposite of arcane, specialized writing, Morris’s work takes an interdisciplinary approach that moves seamlessly among topics, offering up coherent and practical connections between his various scholarly interests and his deeply held commitment to anarchist politics and thought.\r\n\r\nApproached in this way, anthropology and ecology are largely untapped veins whose relevance for anarchism and other traditions of social thought have only recently begun to be explored and debated. But there is a long history of anarchist writers drawing upon works in those related fields. \r\n\r\n Morris’s essays both explore past connections and suggest ways that broad currents of anarchist thought will have new and ever-emerging relevance for anthropology and many other ways of understanding social relationships. His writings avoid the constraints of dogma and reach across an impressive array of topics to give readers a lucid orientation within these traditions and point to new ways to confront common challenges.\r\n\r\n“Brian Morris blazed a lot of trails. He is a scholar of genuine daring and great humanity, and his work deserves to be read and debated for a very long time to come.“ \r\n\r\n—David Graeber, author of Debt: The First 5,000 Years\r\n\r\n“Before there was ’anarchist anthropology,’ there was Brian Morris. This collection introduces the work of an intrepid pioneer, taking anarchist perspectives to where you would least expect them.“ \r\n\r\n—Gabriel Kuhn, editor and translator of All Power to the Councils! A Documentary History of the German Revolution of 1918–1919, Liberating Society from the State and Other Writings by Erich Mühsam, and Revolution and Other Writings by Gustav Landauer\r\n\r\n“Morris’s acerbic analysis of established literature is matched by nuanced ethnographic analysis. . . . He writes accessibly about complicated matters.“ \r\n\r\n—Allen F. Roberts, University of California, Los Angeles\r\n\r\nAbout the author\r\n\r\nBrian Morris is professor emeritus of anthropology at Goldsmiths College, London. He received a doctorate in social anthropology at the London School of Economics and Political Science, having done his PhD fieldwork among hunter-gatherers in Southern India. Prior to his academic career, he worked as a tea planter in Malawi where he has done extensive fieldwork. \r\n\r\n He has written books and articles on topics including ecology, botany, philosophy, history, religion, anthropology, ethnobiology, and social anarchism. After discovering anarchist thought in the mid-1960s, he remained active in various protests and political movements. \r\n\r\n His previous political books include The Anarchist Geographer: An Introduction to the Life of Peter Kropotkin; Kropotkin: The Politics of Community; Ecology and Anarchism: Essays and Reviews on Contemporary Thought; and Bakunin: The Philosophy of Freedom.", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 2217, "added": "2015-04-07T18:10:18", "slug": "9ad1ea3211f4156b", "speakers": [{"id": 15486, "name": "Brian Morris", "slug": "brian-morris"}], "topics": [{"id": 427, "name": "ecology", "path": "/arts/architecture/ecology"}, {"id": 2934, "name": "anthropology", "path": "/society/india/anthropology"}, {"id": 2936, "name": "anthropology", "path": "/society/development/anthropology"}, {"id": 3356, "name": "anarchism", "path": "/academic/socialhistory/anarchism"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 2783, "name": "Housmans Bookshop", "slug": "housmans-bookshop", "city": "London", "postcode": "N1 9DX"}, "organizer": {"id": 2783, "name": "Housmans Bookshop", "slug": "housmans-bookshop"}, "date": "2015-04-15", "dates": [{"id": 15137, "from_date": "2015-04-15", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "19:00:00", "ticket_cost": "Free entry", "ticket_info": null, "additional_info": "HOW TO FIND US:\r\nWe're very easy to find - just a two minute walk from King's Cross/St.Pancras terminals.

The unseaworthy boats carrying migrants and refugees towards an uncertain destiny and destination have again multiplied along Italian shores, despite the large investments in more patrols, surveillance and coordination at the borders. Elsewhere, in Spain and Greece, a similar story repeats. A decade on from the founding of Europe’s border agency Frontex, the challenges at the border seem as steep and intractable as ever. In this time, Europe has developed ever more complex initiatives for tracking, halting, returning and assisting undocumented migrants seeking southern European shores, involving an expanding range of sectors: European border guards and African security forces, humanitarians and policymakers, academics and intelligence experts, defence companies and data managers. What are the stakes for these diverse and at times conflictive groups working on irregular migration at and beyond the EU external borders?

Tired of the lazy clichéd description of Dylan as a Bohemian drunken poet, scrounger and womaniser, Jeff Towns and artist Wyn Thomas decided to investigate exactly what role pubs and alcohol had played in his remarkable life. Described by Cerys Matthews as a literary lock-in , the brand new book Dylan Thomas: The Pubs challenges the myths and legends that surround Dylan and drink, and offers a new and revealing insight into his life and work. Although it is impossible to take drink out of Dylan s life story, it is possible to reposition it to see it as nothing so extraordinary or shameful, and to prevent it from being a barrier between readers and Dylan s real importance as a fine poet, story writer, broadcaster, reader and dramatist. Believe it or not, Dylan Thomas didn’t delight in pubs for the booze, explains Jeff Towns, who is one of the world's leading Dylan Thomas experts. In the book, he reveals the real reason behind Dylan s love of pubs. After over forty years of research, he concludes that Dylan saw the pub as a place of refuge; as a place of conviviality, warmth and shelter; as a theatre in which he could always be counted on to perform, and always be guaranteed an audience! Much of his writing reflects the words, expressions and sayings he heard around him every day, especially so in pubs. Dylan was not only a good story teller, he was also a good listener. It was in these very pubs that Dylan would meet the people who would inspire so much of his work.

Hornsey College of Art, later to become Middlesex University, became renowned for its experimental and progressive approach to art and design education. In the North East, Richard Hamilton and others pioneered a new, radical method of art training at Newcastle University which was to influence higher art education for generations to come. In London the St Martins 'A' course took sculpture students into a radically new pedagogical experiment whilst Art & Language founded their collaboration within Coventry School of Art.\r\n\r\nFrom today’s standpoint, where art and design pedagogy has gained new attention and prompted strong criticism within contemporary art discourse, this moment can be seen as the start of a new wave of thinking about how art and design is taught in the UK. What is interesting from a contemporary perspective is that these new forms of teaching and resistance emerged from within the art institutions, detaching them absolutely from past modes of teaching and learning.\r\n\r\nBeset on one side by the emergence of ‘open schools’ and gallery-led pedagogical projects, and on the other by the emergence of independent commercial ventures that teach specialist skills and techniques, today’s UK art schools may be arriving at a similar turning point. In a climate where University managements suspend students over participation in protests this symposium will examine the possibilities for change and ask how art school teaching can equip our young people for their futures.\r\n\r\nSituating current art schools within the context of an historical legacy of self-organised, experimental and alternative education models, we will probe further, aiming to interrogate the content of art and design education. It will explore current concerns around the desire of students to learn ‘skills’ as well as the role of the tutor who is no longer the expert. It will examine the art school as a community of ideas and resistance as well as how the institution develops ‘officially’ and ‘unofficially’. In a discourse dominated by models, this symposium will ask; can art and design be taught? And if so, how? What is the current art school experience and what could it be?\r\n\r\nSpeakers include scholars of the history of art pedagogy as well as tutors, students and those engaged in pedagogical initiatives external to established institutions.", "additional_info": null, "duration": null, "image_id": 2094, "added": "2014-03-11T14:47:00", "slug": "just-what-is-it-that-makes-todays-art-schools-so-different-so-appealing", "speakers": [{"id": 14524, "name": "Scholars of the history of Art", "slug": "scholars-of-the-history-of-art"}], "topics": [{"id": 1335, "name": "design", "path": "/arts/design/graphicdesign/design"}, {"id": 743, "name": "education", "path": "/academic/arts/linguistics/education"}, {"id": 194, "name": "design", "path": "/arts/architecture/design"}, {"id": 403, "name": "design", "path": "/leisure/gardening/design"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 1394, "name": "ICA", "slug": "ica", "city": "London", "postcode": "SW1Y 4AH"}, "organizer": {"id": 1394, "name": "ICA", "slug": "ica"}, "date": "2014-03-29", "dates": [{"id": 14009, "from_date": "2014-03-29", "to_date": "2014-03-29", "time": "10:00:00", "ticket_cost": "£10 - £12", "ticket_info": "http://www.ica.org.uk/whats-on/just-what-it-makes-todays-art-schools-so-different-so-appealing", "additional_info": "Tickets and Information:\r\n020 7930 3647\r\ntickets@ica.org.uk", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 1394, "name": "ICA", "slug": "ica", "city": "London", "postcode": "SW1Y 4AH"}, "organizer": {"id": 1394, "name": "ICA", "slug": "ica"}}]}, {"id": 13307, "title": "Excel at Your Job, Be Home for Dinner", "synopsis": "LSE public lecture \r\n", "keywords": "work", "body": "Whether you’re a young woman trying to pick the right guy, new parents facing the chaos of raising small kids, or a husband helping your wife return to work, our core challenge is: how can we thrive both at work and at home?

At first he believed in the traditional view that hypnosis is a special induced state of mind, but discussions with friends and his experience with his own hypnotic subjects led him to subscribe to the 'social-compliance' view, namely that hypnosis is best explained by normal, well-understood psychological principles.\r\nHe now makes a living as a lecturer and consultant on hypnosis, talking and demonstrating at schools, universities, and anywhere else they'll pay him. It was at one of Martin's lectures that Derren Brown was inspired to take up his career, and Martin has worked with Derren on a number of recent television shows. Recently he has been working as a hypnosis consultant for Paramount Pictures, producing promotional videos for horror films.\r\nIn today’s talk, Martin will be examining the notion that hypnosis can be used to get people to remember past lives, a phenomenon taken by many as evidence of reincarnation.\r\n3.00 - Robert Teszka: Mind and Magic\r\nRobert Teszka is a cognitive psychologist, magician, science promoter, and massive geek.

Expect a curated collection of demonstrations, experiments, and original research - and perhaps a magic trick or two - as Rob attempts to convince you that sometimes, you just can't trust your own mind.\r\nOrganized and introduced by Stephen Law.\r\nDoors 10.30am (registration) (speakers at 11-1, 2-4pm).

From the Spanish Civil War to the famine of Ethiopia and from human rights struggles to victims of natural disasters, solidarity has driven our multiple engagements with distant others who need our support. But what has happened to solidarity today? What does the word mean? And how are we invited to practice solidarity in our age? \r\n\r\nIn her new book, The Ironic Spectator. Solidarity in the Age of Post-humanitarianism, Lilie Chouliaraki gives a disturbing but persuasive answer to these important but often forgotten questions, by looking at how Amnesty and Oxfam appeals, Audrey Hepburn and Angelina Jolie advocacy, the Live Aid/Live 8 concerts or BBC earthquake news have changed the ways in which we speak about solidarity today. Solidarity, she concludes, has today come to be not about conviction but choice, not vision but lifestyle, not others but ourselves - turning us into the ironic spectators of other people's suffering. \r\n\r\nCraig Calhoun is director of LSE.

Amidst so much death Kulka finds moments of haunting, almost unbearable beauty (for beauty, too, says Kulka, is an inescapable law). But what does it mean to find beauty in Auschwitz? For him, “the blue of the sky in this land is many times stronger than any blue one can see anywhere else.” \r\n\r\nKulka here breaks years of silence, bringing together the personal and historical in a devastating, at times poetic, account of the concentration camps. Returning to the sites of his childhood, Kulka struggles to overcome the obfuscations of memory, unpick the euphemistic language of the camp, and interpret history as he experienced it. These haunting memories – of his mother, who doesn’t look back as she marches towards her death, the sounds of ‘Ode to Joy’ being sung by a children’s choir opposite the crematoria, and the “black stains” along the roadside during the winter death march - instigate forbidden, unanswerable questions. As the author maps his interior world, in a way reminiscent of W. G. Sebald, readers gain a new sense of what it was to experience the Shoah from inside the camps— both at the time, and long afterward. \r\n\r\nA renowned historian of Nazi Germany and the Holocaust, Otto Dov Kulka is Rosenbloom Professor Emeritus in Jewish History at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He was born in Czechoslovakia in 1933. As a child, he was sent first to the ghetto of Theresienstadt and then to Auschwitz. As one of the few survivors he has spent much of his life studying Nazism and the Holocaust, but always as a discipline requiring the greatest coldness and objectivity, with his personal story set to one side. \r\n\r\nIan Kershaw is the author of Hitler 1889-1936: Hubris; Hitler 1936-1945: Nemesis; Making Friends with Hitler; and Fateful Choices: Ten Decisions that Changed the World, 1940-4.

He was heir to a famous Berlin business dynasty on his father's side and was related to the Chief Rabbi of Britain on his mother's side.

His connections in the UK also helped him organise the flight of thousands of Jews to Britain, most notably through the Kindertransport. After the outbreak of World War II, Israel helped German Jewish refugees interned by Britain as 'enemy aliens', provided the British Foreign Office with in-depth analyses of the German economic and political scene, and provided the British Refugee Department with further information on refugees throughout Europe.

It is also essential for assessing the overall role of protected areas in biodiversity conservation and identifying where protected areas need to be further integrated with other conservation efforts to achieve effective species conservation. A better understanding of which protected areas are more successful at conserving intact wildlife populations, and which are not, will enable the identification of conditions and management practices that lead to successful protection.\r\n\r\nThis symposium will provide a synthetic analysis of the world’s protected area portfolio. A key theme will be to identify components of the current portfolio: how is it funded, managed and monitored, and to ask how protected areas have performed from a biodiversity conservation perspective.

This is not a postfeminist era. Feminism is still vibrant, despite declarations that it is over. Feminism is a success, although many gender inequalities remain. Feminism is taking powerful new forms, which makes it unrecognisable to some. In The Future of Feminism, Sylvia Walby offers a provocative riposte to the notion that feminism is dead. Substantiating her arguments with evidence of the vibrancy of contemporary feminism in civil society and beyond, she provides a succinct yet comprehensive critical review of recent treatments of feminism explaining why they have got it wrong. \r\n\r\nThe book provides the definitive account of feminism's new and varied projects, goals, alliances and organizational forms, including feminism as a global wave. It offers engaged accounts of feminist activities across a range of domains in the economy, polity, violence and civil society. Successful feminist projects are not always named as feminist, sometimes being mainstreamed into coalitions with social democratic and global human rights activists. Feminism is now global, though also taking local forms, and these new coalitions are the basis for the future of feminism. On the future of feminism depends not only the future of gender inequality but the future of social inequality more generally. \r\n\r\nSylvia Walby is UNESCO Chair in Gender Research & Professor of Sociology at Lancaster Universtiy. She is interested in both theoretical development and policy impact, and she enjoys collaborative research. Her research is situated within the tension between general social theory and specific forms of inequality, especially gender. This has led from theorizing patriarchy to mainstreaming complex inequalities into social theory. Substantively, she is interested in economic change, fascinated by new political forms (e.g. European Union) and concerned about marginalised groups (domestic violence matters). These issues are framed by globalisation, the understanding of which requires the use of complexity theory, and 'human rights' which has become the most important framing of contemporary projects for global justice.", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 732, "added": "2011-09-10T20:35:28", "slug": "872a4a2cdc1e7c04", "speakers": [{"id": 11480, "name": "Professor Sylvia Walby", "slug": "professor-sylvia-walby"}, {"id": 5335, "name": "Professor  Diane Perrons", "slug": "professor-diane-perrons"}], "topics": [{"id": 2490, "name": "feminism", "path": "/society/gender/feminism/feminism"}, {"id": 93, "name": "sociology", "path": "/academic/sociology"}, {"id": 2344, "name": "women", "path": "/society/law/international/women"}, {"id": 2428, "name": "women", "path": "/academic/politics/greatbritain/women"}, {"id": 2650, "name": "gender", "path": "/academic/gender"}], "supercategory": "society", "venue": {"id": 2130, "name": "New Theatre", "slug": "new-theatre", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC2A 2AE"}, "organizer": {"id": 1287, "name": "London School of Economics & Political Science", "slug": "london-school-of-economics-political-science"}, "date": "2011-11-21", "dates": [{"id": 10552, "from_date": "2011-11-21", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "18:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": "Suggested hashtag for this event for Twitter users: #lsefeminism \r\n\r\nThis event is free and open to all with no ticket required.

The power of knowledge was summoned to free humans of their mortality. Science was used against science and became a channel for faith. \r\n\r\nScience had disclosed a world in which humans were no different from other animals in facing final oblivion when they died and eventual extinction as a species. That was the message of Darwinism, not fully accepted even by Darwin himself. For nearly everyone it was an intolerable vision, and since most had given up religion they turned to science for escape from the world that science had revealed. \r\n\r\nIn Britain a powerful and well-connected movement sprang up aiming to find scientific evidence that human personality survived bodily death. Psychical researchers, supported by some of the leading figures of the day, believed immortality might be a demonstrable fact. At the same time that sections of the English elite were being drawn into psychical research another anti-death movement was emerging in Russia. As in England science and the paranormal were not separate, but mingled in a current of thought that aimed to create a substitute for religion. \r\n\r\nScience and faith have interacted at many points. They came together in two revolts against death, each claiming that science could give humanity what religion had promised – immortal life. \r\n\r\nJohn Gray is most recently the acclaimed author of Black Mass: Apocalyptic Religion and the Death of Utopia, and Straw Dogs: Thoughts on Humans and Other Animals. Having been Professor of Politics at Oxford, Visiting Professor at Harvard and Yale and Professor of European Thought at the London School of Economics, he now writes full time. His selected writings, Gray’s Anatomy, were published by Penguin in 2009.  The Immortalization Commission: Science and the Strange Quest to Cheat Death is published in February 2011. \r\n\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 732, "added": "2011-01-20T19:51:20", "slug": "5124dea60c6365a0", "speakers": [{"id": 782, "name": "Professor John Gray", "slug": "professor-john-gray"}, {"id": 3159, "name": "Dr  Simon Glendinning", "slug": "dr-simon-glendinning"}], "topics": [{"id": 131, "name": "authors", "path": "/arts/literature/fiction/british/21stcentury/authors"}, {"id": 130, "name": "21stcentury", "path": "/arts/literature/fiction/british/21stcentury"}, {"id": 170, "name": "newtopic", "path": "/science/chemistry/biochemistry/catalysis/newtopic"}, {"id": 1891, "name": "literature", "path": "/arts/literature/19thcentury/literature"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 2113, "name": "Sheikh Zayed Theatre", "slug": "sheikh-zayed-theatre", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC2A 2AE"}, "organizer": {"id": 1287, "name": "London School of Economics & Political Science", "slug": "london-school-of-economics-political-science"}, "date": "2011-02-19", "dates": [{"id": 9679, "from_date": "2011-02-19", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "17:00:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": "All events in the Literary Festival programme are free and open to all, but a ticket is required.

Effective conservation depends on our ability to measure and monitor biodiversity change, and on the responses to biodiversity loss of a wide group of stakeholders and actors, including governments, local communities and the international community.\r\n\r\nA range of biodiversity indices are under development to assess progress towards the 2010 targets of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). However, whilst the 2010 targets provide an important mechanism by which to assess global biodiversity change, ensuring that appropriate monitoring systems are in place and translating monitoring results into effective conservation on the ground remains a major global challenge for a number of reasons, including financial and technical-capacity constraints, and policy and legal barriers.\r\n\r\nDeveloping a better understanding of the difficulties faced by countries in meeting their obligations under the CBD and helping bridge the gap between international commitments and local action is the major theme of this symposium. Thus, the symposium will first assess the methodologies and techniques currently available to monitor biodiversity, go on to explore those which are likely to be available in the future, and finally examine how best to ensure that biodiversity monitoring and responses to biodiversity change are incorporated effectively into policy and practice at national and local levels.\r\n\r\nThe symposium will provide a synopsis of the best current thinking on how to monitor biodiversity loss and how to ensure monitoring results have real impacts on conservation.\r\n\r\n\r\nOrganised by Sarah Durant, Nathalie Pettorelli, Ben Collen, Linda Krueger, Matthew Hatchwell and Jonathan Baillie.\r\n\r\nFor further details or to book your places, please see www.zsl.org/science/scientific-meetings/ or contact Joy Hayward, Scientific Meetings Coordinator, Zoological Society of London, Regent's Park, London NW1 4RY; tel: +44 (0)20 7449 6227; fax: +44 (0)20 7449 6411; e-mail: joy.hayward@zsl.org.", "additional_info": null, "duration": 480, "image_id": 1028, "added": "2009-05-06T04:24:49", "slug": "277f9a2c0d6a50ed", "speakers": [{"id": 8349, "name": "Please see link for full details", "slug": "please-see-link-for-full-details"}], "topics": [{"id": 1396, "name": "biology", "path": "/academic/science/philosophy/engineering/biology"}, {"id": 874, "name": "population", "path": "/society/society/society/population"}, {"id": 1000, "name": "zoology", "path": "/science/biology/naturalhistory/zoology"}, {"id": 999, "name": "biology", "path": "/science/biology/naturalhistory/biology"}, {"id": 676, "name": "naturalhistory", "path": "/academic/naturalhistory"}, {"id": 818, "name": "climatechange", "path": "/science/climatechange"}, {"id": 70, "name": "biology", "path": "/science/biology"}, {"id": 1534, "name": "conservation", "path": "/science/conservation"}, {"id": 1105, "name": "ecology", "path": "/science/ecology"}, {"id": 468, "name": "naturalhistory", "path": "/science/naturalhistory"}, {"id": 467, "name": "zoology", "path": "/science/zoology"}], "supercategory": "academic", "venue": {"id": 1028, "name": "ZSL London Zoo's Meeting Rooms", "slug": "zsl-london-zoos-meeting-rooms", "city": "London", "postcode": "NW1 4RY"}, "organizer": {"id": 685, "name": "The Zoological Society of London", "slug": "the-zoological-society-of-london"}, "date": "2009-06-19", "dates": [{"id": 7034, "from_date": "2009-06-19", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "8:30:00", "ticket_cost": "£130 for both days; £80 per day. 50% discount for students and ZSL members.", "ticket_info": "This is a two-day symposium to be held on Thursday 18 and Friday 19 June 2009.

", "keywords": "Poetry, Events, Debate, Discussion, Intellectual, Poet, Politics, Radicalism", "body": "‘For poetry’ Auden famously wrote ‘makes nothing happen’. This quote is the prima facie evidence most often used against those who think poetry can make a difference in politics. Yet Auden then goes on to say that poetry ‘survives’ as ‘a way of happening, a mouth’. In this anniversary year of ’68, it is worth remembering that the 1960s seemed to bring poetry as a way of happening into the political realm. Poetry ‘happenings’ took on the mantle of events that could challenge social, cultural and political conservatism. For many, it was at arts events, rather than at the barricades, that the ‘revolution’ really took place.\r\n\r\n40 years on, a new generation of poets seem to be reclaiming poetry as a political, not simply cultural, ‘way of happening’. And often it is explicitly associated with calls for political change, from Poets Against War to last year’s Love Poetry Hate Racism events. Poetry once again seems to be picking up the banner of radicalism, especially around environmentalism, as eco-poetry and eco-criticism gain in popularity.\r\n\r\nIs poetry reclaiming its radical roots and confronting contemporary apathy?

Venue: Room 538 (fifth floor), Birkbeck College, Torrington Square, London WC1E 7HX. The event is free and everyone’s welcome.\r\n\r\nCome to hear and discuss the exciting possible near-term developments with some key 21st century technologies. This is not science fiction - it could be science fact, well within our lifetimes. Nanotech means manipulating substances at the level of individual molecules, creating materials and compounds with remarkable properties. Stem cell therapy has the potential to cure cruel degenerative diseases like Parkinsons and Motor Neurone Disease. Both technologies deserve to be progressed carefully and thoughtfully, but also quickly and seriously. In each case, misguided interventions such as the opposition to the Human Fertilisation & Embryology bill threaten to frustrate progress and prolong disease and impoverishment. The speakers describe how we can seize and guide the opportunity despite the scaremongers.\r\n\r\nThe meeting is sponsored by the UKTA, the United Kingdom Transhumanist Association. There is no charge to attend.\r\n\r\nSpeakers:\r\n\r\nJulian Snape: \"Latest developments with nanotechnology\"\r\n\r\nDarren Reynolds: \"Reasons to support and improve the Human\r\nFertilisation & Embryology bill\"\r\n\r\nVenue:\r\n\r\nBirkbeck College - Room 539, 5th floor, Main Building, Torrington Square (which is a pedestrian-only square), London WC1E 7HX - MAP\r\n\r\nThe nearest tube station is Russell Square. Come out of the tube station and turn left, to walk west along Bernard St. Cross over Herbrand St then Woburn Place and keep walking westwards, on the north side of the square. Cross Bedford Way, and turn right into Thornhaugh St, then immediately left to enter Torrington Square through the pedestrian-only courtyard outside SOAS (the School of Oriental and African Studies). Veer right and you'll see the main entrance to Birkbeck College on the left as you walk up Torrington Square. Take the lift to the 5th floor and follow the signs to room 539.\r\n\r\nDiscussion is likely to continue after the event in a nearby pub, for those who are able to stay. There's also the option of joining some of the UKTA regulars for drinks/lunch beforehand, starting c. 12.30, in \"The Friend At Hand\" pub which is situated behind Russell Square tube station on Herbrand Street.

It is highly visible and has tangible outcomes easily grasped by people in the short term. This often results in translocation becoming a showcase for conservation; proof that we are attempting something, and a way to generate public support and involvement.\r\n\r\n!> /assets/images/851.jpg!\r\nBirds are the major taxa in reintroduction projects globally, and provide excellent examples of the significant advances and failures that reintroduction practitioners have made. The overall success of bird reintroduction campaigns is often poor. Reintroduction practice has evolved with little scientific rigour and poorly established monitoring and reporting protocols. The result is we often fail to learn from our mistakes. Conservation science is increasingly addressing this issue and scientists involved in reintroduction procedures have a responsibility to coordinate and advance the expertise generated through their involvement.\r\n\r\n\r\n!< /assets/images/848.jpg!\r\nOf additional benefit is the wide scientific base reintroductions draw from. However, this raises its own problems. Wildlife ecologists, population modellers, geneticists, animal husbandry professionals, and veterinarians all contribute expertise with often differing, and sometimes conflicting, goals and approaches. There is a desperate need to coordinate our thinking across these disciplines to promote a stronger knowledge base for more efficient and successful reintroductions in the future. Our aim is to bring experts from these various fields together to present and discuss their views and answer questions about how to create a unified reintroduction framework.\r\n\r\nOrganised by Dr John Ewen, Professor Doug Armstrong, Kevin Parker & Dr Phil Seddon.\r\n\r\nIMAGE CREDITS: working with birds and locals: Phill Cassey; Robin Trap: Andrew Coffey; kokako: John Ewen.\r\n\r\nFor further details or to book your place, please see www.zsl.org/science/scientific-meetings/ or contact Joy Hayward, Scientific Meetings Coordinator, Zoological Society of London, Regent's Park, London NW1 4RY; tel: +44 (0) 207 449 6227; fax: +44 (0) 207 449 6411; e-mail: joy.hayward@zsl.org\r\n\r\n!/assets/images/849.jpg! !/assets/images/846.jpg! !/assets/images/850.jpg!", "additional_info": null, "duration": 480, "image_id": 818, "added": "2007-08-30T22:46:36", "slug": "avian-reintroduction-biology-current-issues-for-science-and-management", "speakers": [{"id": 5827, "name": "Kevin Parker, Massey University, New Zealand", "slug": "kevin-parker-massey-university-new-zealand"}, {"id": 5823, "name": "John Ewen, Institute of Zoology, ZSL, UK", "slug": "john-ewen-institute-of-zoology-zsl-uk"}, {"id": 5822, "name": "Doug Armstrong, Massey University, New Zealand", "slug": "doug-armstrong-massey-university-new-zealand"}, {"id": 5824, "name": "Philip Seddon, University of Otago, New Zealand", "slug": "philip-seddon-university-of-otago-new-zealand"}, {"id": 5825, "name": "Full details of speakers can be found at", "slug": "full-details-of-speakers-can-be-found-at"}], "topics": [{"id": 752, "name": "conservation", "path": "/science/naturalhistory/conservation"}, {"id": 999, "name": "biology", "path": "/science/biology/naturalhistory/biology"}, {"id": 924, "name": "conservation", "path": "/academic/naturalhistory/conservation"}, {"id": 1002, "name": "conservation", "path": "/leisure/conservation/conservation"}, {"id": 676, "name": "naturalhistory", "path": "/academic/naturalhistory"}, {"id": 70, "name": "biology", "path": "/science/biology"}, {"id": 1105, "name": "ecology", "path": "/science/ecology"}, {"id": 468, "name": "naturalhistory", "path": "/science/naturalhistory"}, {"id": 467, "name": "zoology", "path": "/science/zoology"}], "supercategory": "science", "venue": {"id": 1029, "name": "London Zoo's Meeting Rooms", "slug": "london-zoos-meeting-rooms", "city": "London", "postcode": "NW1 4RY"}, "organizer": {"id": 685, "name": "The Zoological Society of London", "slug": "the-zoological-society-of-london"}, "date": "2008-05-08", "dates": [{"id": 4799, "from_date": "2008-05-08", "to_date": "2008-05-08", "time": "9:00:00", "ticket_cost": "£120 for both days; £70 per day.

Indeed, techniques developed for commercials have gone on to play a part in developing the sophisticated effects we have come to expect from programmes such as Walking with dinosaurs and the latest blockbuster films. The visual effects industry is highly competitive and the creative ambition that exists within it continually drives the development of new technologies that enable creatives to realise their vision, and London leads the way, drawing in talent from around the world. Take, for example, the recent groundbreaking advert for Volkswagen Polo, which updated the classic Singing in the rain routine for a noughties audience. Adverts like this have pushed the boundaries of what can be made to appear before us, but just how far can this combination of technology and creative vision take us? Join our speakers – drawn from London’s leading special effects/post production companies such as The Mill, the Moving Picture Company, Framestore CFC, Golden Square, Rushes, Lola and Absolute – for a fascinating insight into a world where dinosaurs walk, Gene Kelly breakdances and cars turn into robots before your very eyes.

He has published widely on the linguistics and sociolinguistics of indigenous languages in Mexico, including the Otomi and the Nahuas. Flores Farfán is a leading expert in Nahuatl, and has done extensive research on sociolinguistics, language ideologies, pragmatics and language revitalization and reversal. His in-depth research has lead to the development of educational programs for both the Nahuas and the general public. Prof Flores Farfán has co-authored numerous materials with and for indigenous people, including a series of materials for children (audio books, tapes, videos, a website, DVDs, CD-Roms) oriented towards the revitalization, maintenance and development of the cultural and linguistic heritage of indigenous groups from Mexico. He is currently working on the production of similar materials for a number of indigenous groups belonging to different linguistic families in Mexico, including the Nahuas, the Maya and the Mixtec, with all materials also aimed towards a  general public.\r\n\r\nAbstract. In recent years the field of endangered languages has called our attention to the demise of human diversity, especially of linguistic and cultural heritages. It is commonly reckoned that in a couple of generations the vast majority of languages of the world will disappear - unless urgent action is taken to reverse language and cultural shift, reinforcing and empowering language and cultural survival. That is to say that in approximately half a century, 80% to 90% of the world's linguistic and cultural diversity may become a memory. Thus of an estimated 6,000 to 8,000 languages, only about 600 to 800 will constitute the world's linguistic diversity, a figure which of course includes all colonial languages.  \r\n\r\nWe know much more about the causes of language shift, including such common-places as direct demographic genocide, colonial exploitation and discrimination, economic deprivation and social mobility, and processes of migration and urbaniz-ation, than we do of how to effectively maintain and stabilize endangered languages - not to speak of reversing language shift. The call for action to arrest what could be thought as one of the world's coming catastrophes has maybe come all too late. Significantly, most of the current efforts and resources allocated to the field of endangered languages are directed to what is known as 'salvage' or 'documentary linguistics', a museum-like view of languages. Even if it is indeed true that in most cases of moribund languages all we can do is register them, yet the continuum of endangerment encompasses all types of situations, including still viable languages. In this sense, there are very few if any efforts along the lines of what has been termed 'reversing language shift' (Fishman 1991), 'preventive' or even 'peace linguistics' (Crystal 2004), regarding viable languages which are nonetheless endangered, and rapidly experiencing shift. \r\n\r\nThis address will explore what in our view and experience constitute effective ways to reverse language shift. A number of materials stemming from pilot interventions with Mexican indigenous groups, especially children, will be presented. To empower the use of endangered languages, our approach develops, from the bottom up, a participatory methodology, based on the idea of intercultural co-authorship and interactive workshops. Direct interventions at the community level are modeled on a culturally-sensitive perspective which recasts indigenous oral genres (such as riddles) and their visual means (such as the amate, \"painted bark wood paper\"), recreating them in high tech media such as 3D videos and DVD animation.  \r\n\r\nIn the first stage of the work, the presentation of videos in attractive formats, on special occasions such as the communities' Patron Saint's festivity. The attractive formats lend status to the indigenous language and culture, triggering interest and opposing well-established stereotypes and practices. In the second stage, people are invited to participate more actively. This allows the distribution of other materials such as audio-books, which are granted to those participants who spontaneously guess or provide new riddles, other tales, or even comments in the indigenous tongue. Disseminating the materials through such an informal and playful model upgrades the value attributed to children's and other participants' own knowledge, thus reinforcing the use of their linguistic and cultural heritage. This runs counter to the received Mexican state's official language policy - historically an assimilationist, top-down approach, which restricts language planning to schooling and writing down indigenous languages. \r\n\r\nSponsors\r\n\r\nThe primary sponsor of the lecture series at the University of Essex has been the Department of Language and Linguistics, through its seminar series. \r\n\r\nCo-sponsors include the <a title=\"Centre for Theoretical Studies in the Humanities and Social Sciences\" href=\"http://www.essex.ac.uk/centres/TheoStud/frameset.asp?p=events.asp\">Centre for Theoretical Studies in the Humanities and Social Sciences</a>, and the <a title=\"Human Rights Centre\" href=\"http://www2.essex.ac.uk/human_rights_centre/\">Human Rights Centre</a>.\r\n\r\nAdditional thanks go to Prof Martin Atkinson, Prof Paul Hunt, Prof Sheldon Leader, Prof Simon Critchley, and Dr Aletta Norval for their assistance.\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 120, "image_id": null, "added": "2004-11-15T11:02:28", "slug": "140edff5e459f037", "speakers": [{"id": 1731, "name": "Professor José Antonio Flores Farfán", "slug": "professor-josé-antonio-flores-farfán"}], "topics": [{"id": 3, "name": "linguistics", "path": "/academic/arts/linguistics"}, {"id": 88, "name": "linguistics", "path": "/academic/linguistics"}, {"id": 287, "name": "language", "path": "/arts/language"}, {"id": 377, "name": "language", "path": "/academic/language"}, {"id": 549, "name": "sociolinguistics", "path": "/academic/linguistics/sociolinguistics"}], "supercategory": "academic", "venue": {"id": 200, "name": "Essex University, Linguistics Dept", "slug": "essex-university-linguistics-dept", "city": "Colchester", "postcode": "CO4 3SQ"}, "organizer": {"id": 200, "name": "Essex University, Linguistics Dept", "slug": "essex-university-linguistics-dept"}, "date": "2004-11-18", "dates": [{"id": 1431, "from_date": "2004-11-18", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "13:00:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": null, "additional_info": "In Room 4N.2.3.
