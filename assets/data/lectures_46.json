Moreover, almost entire populations were drawn into fierce and uncompromising political and ideological conflicts, and many ended up being more than mere victims or observers: they themselves became perpetrators or facilitators of violence, often to protect their own lives but also to gain various benefits. Yugoslavia in particular saw a gradual culmination of a complex and brutal civil war, which ultimately killed more civilians than did the foreign occupying armies. This lecture will tell a story of the tremendous impact of such pervasive and multi-layered political violence, and will look at ordinary citizens' attempts to negotiate these extraordinary wartime political pressures. It proposes to use Yugoslav psychiatric case files as unique windows into this harrowing history in order to gain an original perspective on the effects of wartime violence and occupation through the history of psychiatry, mental illness and personal experience. By looking at patient files as historical sources, it explores the socio-cultural history of wartime through the eyes of (mostly lower-class) psychiatric patients. Moreover, the experiences of observing, suffering and committing political violence critically affected the understanding of human psychology, pathology and normality in WWII and post-war Balkans and Europe. The lecture traces the formation and re-definition of psychiatric concepts, categories and practices in the context of extreme violence, Nazi occupation and post-war socialist revolution. It shows how such brutal external conditions and unprecedented anti-civilian violence transformed psychiatric and scientific paradigms, and changed psychiatric and broader public evaluations of the human psyche.\r\n\r\nAna Antic is a post-doctoral fellow in the Department of History, Classics and Archaeology at Birkbeck.

Some were by composers who fought and died during the war, including Butterworth’s moving A Shropshire Lad set to poems by A. E. Housman, which foretells the sacrifice the young composer and many others were to make.  It is from these songs that we take the title of tonight’s session: the Lads that will never be old. We will also look at songs written and performed during the war by such familiar names as Vaughan Williams, Ivor Gurney, Roger Quilter, Cyril Scott, Franck Bridge and John Ireland.  The Conway Hall is the home of the Ethical Society.  Its concert series, which began in 1887, is among the longest-running in the UK.

From diverse backgrounds, they met in the years before the Great War as students at the Slade School of Art, where they formed part of what their teacher Henry Tonks described as the school's last 'crisis of brilliance'.\r\n\r\nUsing letters, diaries, memoirs and biographies, Haycock recreates in intimate detail the formative years of these supremely gifted and committed painters. More than just a history of art, A Crisis of Brilliance is a story of individual artists and their times. It is an exploration of artistic ambition, struggle and success; and of lives linked by close friendships, fierce rivalries and love. \r\n\r\nTo the Bloomsbury Group critic Roger Fry they were 'les jeunes': the Young British Artists of their day. As their talents evolved in different directions, they became Futurists, Vorticists and 'Bloomsberries', and befriended the leading writers and intellectuals of the time, from Virginia Woolf and Rupert Brooke to D. H. Lawrence and Katherine Mansfield. They and their Bohemian colleagues led the way in fashion with their avant garde clothes and haircuts; they slept with their models and with prostitutes; their tempestuous love affairs descended into obsession, murder and suicide. And as Europe plunged into the madness of the 'War to end Wars', they responded to its horror with all the passion and genius they could muster. \r\n\r\nThe Wheatsheaf\r\nRathbone Place\r\nW1\r\n7.30 pm\r\n17th May\r\nAdmission £3\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 60, "image_id": null, "added": "2011-05-10T21:24:20", "slug": "crisis-of-brilliance", "speakers": [{"id": 11138, "name": "  David Haycock", "slug": "david-haycock"}], "topics": [{"id": 131, "name": "authors", "path": "/arts/literature/fiction/british/21stcentury/authors"}, {"id": 130, "name": "21stcentury", "path": "/arts/literature/fiction/british/21stcentury"}, {"id": 1026, "name": "artists", "path": "/religion/islam/women/artists"}, {"id": 129, "name": "british", "path": "/arts/literature/fiction/british"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 2153, "name": "The Wheatsheaf", "slug": "the-wheatsheaf", "city": "London ", "postcode": "W1T 1DG"}, "organizer": {"id": 2149, "name": "Sohemian Society", "slug": "sohemian-society"}, "date": "2011-05-17", "dates": [{"id": 10199, "from_date": "2011-05-17", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "19:30:00", "ticket_cost": "£3", "ticket_info": "From door on evening.", "additional_info": "Website:www.sohemians.com", "members_only": "No", "members_info": "  ", "venue": {"id": 2153, "name": "The Wheatsheaf", "slug": "the-wheatsheaf", "city": "London ", "postcode": "W1T 1DG"}, "organizer": {"id": 2149, "name": "Sohemian Society", "slug": "sohemian-society"}}]}, {"id": 9731, "title": "The Lost World (1960) on the Big Screen", "synopsis": "Classic film night and introduction.", "keywords": "Science, evolution, film, discovery", "body": "From a human point of view, animal life begins with its discovery.

It is also the least understood and is threatened by increasing anthropogenic disturbance. Advances in technology mean it is now possible to fish these regions to depths in excess of two kilometres. Mining, drilling, acidification and warming all present serious threats to biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.\r\n\r\nHigh Seas, those areas of the open ocean that lie beyond the 200nm Exclusive Economic Zones of coastal nations, encompass ~50% of Earth's surface but remain largely unregulated. Attempts to ameliorate threats to fished species by conventional fishery management approaches are frequently ineffective. Legal frameworks for prospecting and the extraction of mineral resources from the deep seabed beyond national jurisdiction exist but do not apply to other activities.\r\n\r\nMarine Protected Areas established in coastal marine ecosystems are proving successful in effectively protecting diversity and productivity where traditional management approaches have failed. In 2002 the World Summit on Sustainable Development listed the establishment of Marine Protected Areas and representative networks by the year 2012 as a distinct goal. In response to concerns raised by the international community the UN adopted several resolutions with respect to the management of deep-sea fisheries on the high seas. This issue is high on conservation agendas; however, there remains a critical need for science to translate rapidly and effectively into management policy.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this symposium is to assess the current state of progress, and any barriers, towards the establishment of Marine Protected Areas, particularly in regions beyond the reaches of national jurisdiction — the high seas.\r\n\r\n_Organised by Kirsty Kemp (Institute of Zoology, ZSL) and Alex Rogers (Dept. of Zoology, University of Oxford)._\r\n\r\nREGISTRATION WILL OPEN SOON\r\n\r\nFor further details or to register your interest, please see www.zsl.org/science/scientific-meetings/ or contact Joy Hayward, Scientific Meetings Coordinator, Zoological Society of London, Regent's Park, London NW1 4RY; tel: +44 (0)20 7449 6227; fax: +44 (0)20 7449 6411; e-mail: joy.hayward@zsl.org.\r\n\r\n*ZSL Science and Conservation Events:* An essential part of ZSL's work is to communicate relevant, high-quality zoological and conservation science.

Does crude, physical caricaturing come with the territory when you are a public figure? ", "keywords": "Cartooning, Drawing, Politics", "body": "In one of Charles Schultz’s Peanuts strips, Lucy declares that she is going to be a political cartoonist ‘lashing out with my crayon’. From Gillray to Giles, Hogarth to Herblock, the most vicious political cartoons are often the most successful – capturing and caricaturing the urgency of political situations through the personal foibles of politicians. Gordon Brown in the past year has been variously depicted as a wheelchair bound incontinent and a sweating poker player betting it all on the joker (Peter Mandelson). But the best cartoonists’ work is insightful even when it’s cruel. As Theodore Dalrymple puts it ‘Gillray, like Swift before him and Dickens after him, saw everything through a lens that clarified even as it distorted’. \r\n\r\nBut we live in an era in which anything that can be seen as ‘offensive’ is met with all round disapproval. A storm erupted earlier this year after the New York Post published a cartoon showing police shooting a chimp, which was mistaken for a racist reference to President Obama. The New Yorker ‘Terrorist Fist-Jab’ cover featuring Obama and his wife Michelle had already caused a commotion, though the intention was actually to satirise fear-mongering. Any hint that a minority group is being targeted provokes calls for censorship. Martin Rowson’s depiction for the New Humanist of new atheists ‘outing’ themselves behind an effeminate Richard Dawkins brought accusations of homophobia. The cartoon series Popetown, was dropped by the BBC after protests by Roman Catholics. And we are all familiar with the controversy about cartoons depicting the prophet Mohammed. \r\n\r\nShould political cartoonists pull no punches, whatever offence they cause? Does crude, physical caricaturing come with the territory when you are a public figure? Or is it too easy to lampoon politicians rather than their politics?

The civil liberties of free expression, assembly and association make an appearance, as does the democratic right to participate in the government of your country. So too do social and economic rights to education, health, social security, health and leisure, and much else besides. This declaration of rights, long hailed as a manifesto for mankind, has grown in authority through its sixty years of life. Now to celebrate its birthday, the Centre for the Study of Human Rights asks its audience to vote on which is the greatest right of them all. Is it to think, to eat, to rest, to talk, or something unexpected, like the right to own property or to enjoy the arts. In a series of rounds, invited contestants will argue the case for their right, defend their choice and prove its worth against others, until eventually only one remains, the Right of Rights 1948-2008. \r\n\r\nShami Chakrabarti is director of Liberty.

Working outside the confines of the official embed programme, independent journalists Ghaith Abdul-Ahad, Kael Alford,Thorne Anderson, and Rita Leistner documented the issues often underreported by mainstream media. The result is a rare and intimate body of work.\r\n\r\n“Blood started dripping on my camera and all that I could think about was how to keep the lens clean. A man in his forties next to me was crying. He wasn't injured, he was just crying. The helicopters wheeled overhead, and I realized that they were firing directly at us. I wanted to be invisible; I wanted to hide under the others.”\r\n\r\nGhaith Abdul-Ahad studied architecture in Baghdad University and had never travelled outside Iraq until after the recent war. A deserter from Saddam Hussein’s Iraqi army, Ghaith lived underground in Baghdad for six years, changing his residence every few months to avoid detection and arrest. He began working as a journalist after the US-led invasion, writing for The Guardian and Washington Post. \r\n\r\nKael Alford was one of the few independent photographers in Baghdad during the US bombing documenting the impact of the war and its aftermath. On her most recent trip, she documented the culture surrounding the second front of insurgents, the Mehdi Militia, making many trips across front lines in Najaf and Sadr City to photograph their battles with US forces.\r\n\r\nThorne Anderson has spent ten months of the last two years in Iraq. He is among the few active journalists who worked in Iraq during the sanctions period before the most recent war.  While covering the war itself from Baghdad, he was arrested by Iraqi intelligence and expelled from the country. He returned to Iraq as soon as the borders opened at the end of the war and has covered the nascent occupation resistance movements - both Sunni and Shiite. His most recent Iraq coverage focussed on Shiite uprisings from Sadr City to the besieged Najaf, where he and journalist Phillip Robertson spent three days inside the Imam Ali shrine with the Mehdi Militia and its supporters at the peak of the American military siege.\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": null, "added": "2006-06-12T19:29:22", "slug": "590772d9c51b4236", "speakers": [{"id": 4037, "name": "Ghaith Abdul-Ahad", "slug": "ghaith-abdul-ahad"}, {"id": 4038, "name": "Thorne Anderson", "slug": "thorne-anderson"}, {"id": 4039, "name": "Kael Alford", "slug": "kael-alford"}], "topics": [{"id": 311, "name": "photography", "path": "/arts/art/photography"}, {"id": 455, "name": "photography", "path": "/arts/finearts/photography"}, {"id": 350, "name": "iraq", "path": "/academic/history/iraq"}, {"id": 351, "name": "iraq", "path": "/academic/anthropology/iraq"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 537, "name": "The Frontline Club", "slug": "the-frontline-club", "city": "London", "postcode": "W2 1QJ"}, "organizer": {"id": 537, "name": "The Frontline Club", "slug": "the-frontline-club"}, "date": "2006-06-23", "dates": [{"id": 3251, "from_date": "2006-06-23", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "19:30:00", "ticket_cost": "£5", "ticket_info": "kavita.sharma@frontlineclub.com", "additional_info": "www.frontlineclub.com", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 537, "name": "The Frontline Club", "slug": "the-frontline-club", "city": "London", "postcode": "W2 1QJ"}, "organizer": {"id": 537, "name": "The Frontline Club", "slug": "the-frontline-club"}}]}, {"id": 2991, "title": "Personalised Medicine: Cure or Quandary?", "synopsis": "Imagine being prescribed ‘personalised’ medicines, specific to your genetic makeup.

His talk accompanies the Museum’s exhibition Raining Cats, Dogs and Fishing Rods which looks at the colourful world of idioms used in the many languages spoken in Hackney today.\r\n\r\nMichael has often drawn on his family experiences in his work.  His first collection of poems, Mind Your Own Business, published in 1974 reflected on his boyhood relationships with his brother and his parents. Since then, Michael has written many anthologies of poems, edited collections of classic poems, written picture books and has made many radio broadcasts. He  writes everywhere, scribbling down his 'stuff' on buses, trains, beaches, as well as in his own back garden in Hackney. \r\n\r\nDrawing on his own family’s rich language heritage Michael Rosen will take us on a journey round some of their colourful sayings. He writes:\r\n\r\n\"Every family, every group of people has a set of sayings. Some are said in anger, some for a laugh, some to offer advice, some to console ourselves. In my family my father especially could mutter curses in a language I didn't understand - Yiddish, and it's taken me years to find out what they meant. (Could you really wish that someone would catch cholera?). Because he was in the US army he came back with a set of phrases from there like, 'Who gave youse guys route step?' meaning why aren't you marching in time? And because he taught English Literature he was fond of using quotes from Shakespeare and Dickens like 'Ah the whirligig of time brings in his revenges' - which was only an old way of saying, 'What goes around, comes around'. \r\nJoin us at Hackney Museum for an evening of Rosenisms, and share with us some of your own!\r\nThis project is supported by the Heritage Lottery Fund", "additional_info": null, "duration": 60, "image_id": 272, "added": "2005-01-20T17:01:31", "slug": "097d5731639982e4", "speakers": [{"id": 1029, "name": "Prof Michael Rosen", "slug": "prof-michael-rosen"}], "topics": [{"id": 131, "name": "authors", "path": "/arts/literature/fiction/british/21stcentury/authors"}, {"id": 130, "name": "21stcentury", "path": "/arts/literature/fiction/british/21stcentury"}, {"id": 129, "name": "british", "path": "/arts/literature/fiction/british"}, {"id": 430, "name": "poetry", "path": "/children/books/poetry"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 254, "name": "Hackney Museum", "slug": "hackney-museum", "city": "London", "postcode": "E8 1GQ"}, "organizer": {"id": 254, "name": "Hackney Museum", "slug": "hackney-museum"}, "date": "2005-01-27", "dates": [{"id": 1586, "from_date": "2005-01-27", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "18:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": "The event is free, but booking is essential.
