British folklore and chronicle relates from very early times instances of vampire-like and undead behaviour, spelling disaster for communities. Radical social upheaval – such as the Norman Conquest – spawns narratives about the undead; later chroniclers remark that there are so many tales of the undead it would be tedious to list them all.  Recent archaeological finds seem to confirm the survival of these beliefs right up to the end of the medieval period; time-honoured ways of preventing the dead from walking again offer the best explanation for the unusual post-mortem treatment of some bodies. Nor is it just the British Isles that suffer from the plague of the walking dead; Icelandic sagas have many such tales, and some useful tips about how to settle such revenants once and for all.\r\n\r\nCarolyne Larrington is a Tutorial Fellow in English Literature at St John's Oxford and the author of The Land of the Green Man, Winter is Coming: the Medieval World of Game of Thrones and An Introduction to Norse Myths.\r\n\r\nThe Appearance of Ghosts: shrouds, sheets or see-through? Dr. Susan Owens\r\n\r\nThe idea that the dead can return to haunt the living is deeply rooted in the British imagination, and ghosts are central to countless plays and paintings, stories and ballads, photographs and films. But why has the appearance and behaviour of ghosts in art and literature altered over time? When did they stop wearing shrouds and put on white sheets or become see-through? And what do these changes reveal about them – and us?\r\n\r\nDr. Susan Owens, former Curator of Paintings at the V&A, is the author of The Ghost: A Cultural History (Tate Publishing, 2017).\r\n\r\n'I Shall Goe Unto a Hare' - Isobel Gowdie, Covens, Shamans and Familiar Spirits in Seventeenth Century Scotland – Dr. John Callow\r\n\r\nThe four confessions given by Isobel Gowdie to a Scottish court, in May 1662, are seminal witchcraft texts; bringing folk belief in the faerie, the world of familiar spirits, night flight and the coven to stark prominence. This talk shows how a marginal figure, in her own day, moved towards the cultural mainstream, through the works of modern composers, rock musicians and novelist, and was comprehensively recast in the process.\r\n\r\nJohn Callow is an author, screenwriter and historian, specialising in Seventeenth Century politics, witchcraft, and popular culture including Embracing the Darkness: A Cultural History of Witchcraft (IB Tarsus 2017).\r\n\r\nPhantom Black Dogs - Mark Norman\r\n\r\nMark Norman is the creator and host of the Folklore Podcast and author of Black Dog Folklore, Black Dog Folklore, a comprehensive study of the image of the Black Dog in folklore, with an extensive gazetteer of over 700 UK sightings and traditions. He holds the UKs largest archive of black dog material and in this talk, will introduce the symbolism of the Black Dog motif.\r\n\r\nHow to Clean a 3,000-Year-Old Hill Figure - Emily Cleaver\r\n\r\nEmily Cleaver recounts a recent ‘scouring’ of the Uffington White Horse, the traditional cleaning event that has kept the chalk figure from becoming overgrown since its construction in the Iron Age. Exploring the archeological evidence for the origins of the figure, plus local folklore from fertility rituals to furniture arrangement. \r\n\r\nEmily is a writer with an interest in folklore, local traditions and history.\r\n\r\nThe Goat God in Albion – Gurus Cope \r\n\r\nGyrus explores the bonds between the British landscape and the Greek god of nature, Pan. The Victorian obsession with Pan forms a historical backdrop for strange present-day encounters in rural darkness, and synchronicities which unearth Pan's hidden presence in the famed landscape of Avebury.'\r\n\r\nGyrus is the publisher of Dreamflesh  and the author of North: The Rise & Fall of the Polar Cosmos\r\n\r\nTalk of the Devil\r\n\r\nHe builds bridges, he drains punchbowls, he hurls quoits, he preaches strange doctrine from his pulpit. There’s no getting away from the Devil in the English legendary landscape, but who is he really? From his Arse to his Elbow, the Devil of local lore is a strange compound of fiend and buffoon. Those sulphurous hoofprints do not lead to any orthodox theology.\r\nJeremy Harte is a researcher into folklore and archaeology, with a particular interest in sacred space and tales of encounters with the supernatural. He is the author of English Holy Wells: A sourcebook and Explore Fairy Traditions.\r\n\r\nIn the dead of the night, when all people were sleeping: Ghosts in folk songs – Professor Paul Cowdell\r\n\r\nTraditional songs are full of folklore about ghosts. They tell you why people become ghosts, what ghosts look like, what the living must do to allow the dead to rest in peace. Paul Cowdell, folklore expert on ghosts and a fine singer, will be talking about ghostlore in and around traditional songs, and singing some. Songs may include ‘The Yarmouth Tragedy’, ‘The Unquiet Grave’ and ‘Polly Vaughn’.\r\nPaul completed his PhD at the University of Hertfordshire, where hewas looking at contemporary belief in ghosts.\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 480, "image_id": null, "added": "2017-09-20T14:00:44", "slug": "the-haunted-landscape-folklore-ghosts-and-witchcraft", "speakers": [], "topics": [], "supercategory": "academic", "venue": {"id": 704, "name": "Conway Hall", "slug": "conway-hall", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC1R 4RL"}, "organizer": {"id": 2524, "name": "London Fortean Society", "slug": "london-fortean-society"}, "date": "2017-11-18", "dates": [{"id": 16504, "from_date": "2017-11-18", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "22:00:00", "ticket_cost": "£20", "ticket_info": "https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/the-haunted-landscape-2017-folklore-ghosts-and-witchcraft-tickets-38000736225?", "additional_info": "Holborn station", "members_only": "No", "members_info": "All are welcome", "venue": {"id": 704, "name": "Conway Hall", "slug": "conway-hall", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC1R 4RL"}, "organizer": {"id": 2524, "name": "London Fortean Society", "slug": "london-fortean-society"}}]}, {"id": 15636, "title": "The rise of Christmas shopping", "synopsis": "Brunchtime lecture with glass of Bucks Fizz and free entry to Kensington Palace afterwards", "keywords": "Lecture; Kensington Palace; Talk; History; Contemporary; shopping; consumerism; royal; stories", "body": "Explore the development of the festive shopping period as we know it.

And what does that mean for the rest of us?\r\n\r\nItay Talgam spent ten years conducting prominent orchestras around the world. And he believes that his art can teach us about inspired leadership in all spheres of creativity. Great conductors make room for the passion of their musicians; they respect the gap between the baton and the instruments; they embrace their own ignorance; and they focus more on listening than speaking. Great leaders need to do the same.\r\n\r\nItay is the author of The Ignorant Maestro (Penguin) and his TED talk ‘Lead like the great conductors’ has been viewed more than 2 million times. Now in a rare visit to the UK, he tells us what the great conductors can teach us about inspiring unpredictable brilliance in ourselves and others. With anecdotes from the lives of the great conductors, including Strauss and Bernstein, and from his own work with everyone from military generals to schoolteachers, Itay will provide the keys for exceptional leadership and harmonious cooperation in business, government, education and even family.\r\n\r\nABOUT SUNDAY MORNINGS\r\nSince 2008 The School of Life has presented strictly secular Sunday Sermons exploring the values we should live by today.

However, in recent years, a competing discourse has emerged which suggests that the harms and/or problematic meanings that have been associated with ‘FGM’ may not be as straightforward as is typically assumed, and may even be comparable to those of a number of ‘Western’ practices that have failed to attract the same degree of censure. Such potentially comparable ‘Western’ practices raised by various critics include female genital ‘cosmetic’ surgery, intersex genital ‘correction’ surgery, and infant male circumcision. If these practices are in fact comparable along the relevant dimensions, then it would raise the possibility of a cultural or moral double standard on the part of ‘Western’ governments and agencies with respect to this very controversial practice. In this talk I assess these competing positions and propose an ethical framework for evaluating ‘FGM’ that both acknowledges the genuine harms of the practice and yet which avoids the charge of moral hypocrisy.\r\n\r\nBrian D.

In the 15th century this influence travelled almost exclusively in one direction from north to south. However, in the 16th century this direction was effectively to reverse as the works of Michelangelo and other Italian masters caught the imagination of Netherlandish artists and their patrons (from Gossaert ultimately to Rubens).  \r\n\r\nPAINTING PRACTICES AND TECHNIQUES\r\n\r\nNetherlandish painters created effects of astonishing realism by shifting from egg tempera to oil paint.

Change happens when an individual begins to awaken to a new consciousness, a new way of being. This in turn leads to the impulse to do something quite different in the world. Acting on the principle that inner awakening leads to outer change, the awakened individual starts to want to take an active role in creating a new future and no longer wants a future that repeats the conditionings of the past. Instead, there is a compulsion to create a new horizon of potential and possibility for all rather than simply survive the crises we are facing as a species. The challenges we face demand a new way of understanding who we are and where we are going as a species. We need a new worldview—a new way to make sense of life.

The Occult World of C.G. Jung\r\n- Gary Lachman\r\n \r\nThroughout his long and sometimes turbulent career, the psychologist C.G. Jung insisted that he was first and foremost a scientist. Yet from the start, Jung's interest in the human psyche had a decidedly paranormal, even occult slant. From his early days attending séances to his last pronouncements on a dawning 'Age of Aquarius', Jung moved in territories most scientists ignored, when they didn't ridicule them outright. Jung himself, though, had a very ambivalent relation to mysticism and the occult. \r\n\r\nWhile in his personal life he embraced a variety of occult ideas, as a 'scientist' he downplayed his involvement, and it was not until late in his career that he came 'out of the closet' and made public his belief in esoteric notions like synchronicity, his belief in a coming New Age, and his use of magical practices, like the Chinese I Ching. \r\n\r\nAlthough working in the shadow of his one-time friend and mentor Freud for much of his career, today Jung is one of the founding fathers of the 'new consciousness' movement, and his mystical and occult investigations have been responsible for the huge interest in many of the 'alternative' ideas widely popular today. \r\n\r\nGary’s talk will chart Jung's 'occult history', look into the reasons behind his early reticence and later advocacy, and ask whether Jung was really a scientist at all.\r\n\r\nGary Lachman is the author of several books on the meeting ground between consciousness, culture, and the western esoteric tradition, including Politics and the Occult, Rudolf Steiner: An Introduction to His Life and Work, In Search of P.D. Ouspensky, A Secret History of Consciousness and The Dedalus Book of the 1960s: Turn Off Your Mind. He is a regular contributor to several journals, including the Independent on Sunday, Guardian, Times Literary Supplement, and Fortean Times, and frequently broadcasts for the BBC. As Gary Valentine, he was a founding member of the rock group Blondie, and wrote some of their early hits.

", "keywords": "Child protection, Parenting", "body": "The relationship between adults and children is increasingly fraught, and viewed through the prism of risk. Not only teachers, neighbours and relatives, but even parents themselves are seen as potential abusers. But some childcare professionals and academics like Manchester Metropolitan University’s Heather Piper have begun to challenge this climate. Her book ‘Researching Sex and Lies in the Classroom’ is a critique of the ‘No Touch’ policies ubiquitous in schools and early years settings, and examines the insecurities surrounding adult-child relations. Not so long ago, those who saw something unwholesome in pictures of toddlers in the bath would be accused of having ‘dirty minds’. Nowadays, official policy and institutional practice works on the assumption that those working with children are ‘dirty-minded’ from the outset. Critics like Piper argue that when we are encouraged to view all physical contact with children as something to be avoided, in case it is perceived as inappropriate, we begin to apply a damaging check on every spontaneous interaction. \r\n\r\nMeanwhile, family policy increasingly focuses on the need to protect children from the failings of parents, who could either pose a danger to their children, or simply not know what they’re doing. But some parents too have begun to express concerns about the idea that they’re hopeless and don’t try hard enough. Jennie Bristow argues in her book Standing up to Supernanny that the professionalisation of parenting undermines the authority of parents, and inhibits the spontaneous loving relationships with parents, and other adults, that children need in order to flourish. \r\n\r\nSo, how much do child protection policies help prevent abuse - and how much do they damage adults’ ability to conduct normal, caring relationships with the children in their charge? \r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 120, "image_id": 1235, "added": "2009-09-18T09:36:24", "slug": "62a4176ebd69f387", "speakers": [{"id": 8805, "name": "Jennie Bristow", "slug": "jennie-bristow"}, {"id": 8806, "name": "Heather Piper", "slug": "heather-piper"}], "topics": [{"id": 1159, "name": "parenting", "path": "/children/learning/parenting"}], "supercategory": "children", "venue": {"id": 2060, "name": "Blackwell University Bookshop", "slug": "blackwell-university-bookshop", "city": "Manchester", "postcode": "M13 9RN"}, "organizer": {"id": 45, "name": "Institute of Ideas", "slug": "institute-of-ideas"}, "date": "2009-10-14", "dates": [{"id": 7519, "from_date": "2009-10-14", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "18:30:00", "ticket_cost": "£7.50 (£5)", "ticket_info": "Blackwell: 0161 274 3331.", "additional_info": "http://www.battleofideas.org.uk/index.php/2009/session_detail/2690/", "members_only": "No", "members_info": "Join the Institute of Ideas: www.instituteofideas.com", "venue": {"id": 2060, "name": "Blackwell University Bookshop", "slug": "blackwell-university-bookshop", "city": "Manchester", "postcode": "M13 9RN"}, "organizer": {"id": 45, "name": "Institute of Ideas", "slug": "institute-of-ideas"}}]}, {"id": 7066, "title": "The Self Healing Heart: regenerating a sound heart after attack", "synopsis": "Professor Michael Schneider is seeking a commercial solution to harness the body's own mechanism to repair damaged hearts", "keywords": "Medicine, heart, heart attack, repair, cell", "body": "Winning one of the Medical Futures Awards (dubbed the Dragons' Den of medical awards for its style of selection) Michael Schneider is seeking a commercial solution which will harness the body's own mechanism to repair damaged hearts.

Rainer’s work examines the balance between political issues and quotidian personal life, incorporating the effects of interpersonal relationships and those established in professional situations. Her work deals with “connectiveness” in the era of radical change through the 1960’s and 70’s, when important political debates and challenges were emerging in the United States and beyond. After exploring innovative and even revolutionary ideas in bodily movement, she further explored her concerns – political and aesthetic ideas as well as gender issues – in the field of the moving image. Although a shift from performing arts to film might seem common today, Pontbriand highlights why this was considered to be a daring transition at the time. She focuses on the years 1967 to 1972, including seminal encounters Rainer had with Michael Snow, Hollis Frampton, Robert Morris, Robert Rauschenberg, and Babettte Mangolte, to name a few. These years lead her from writing her famous manifesto text The Mind is a Muscle, to creating her first feature-length film, Lives of Performers.\r\n \r\nThurs 26 Feb\r\nFrom Choreographer to Cinematographer, Chantal Pontbriand on Yvonne Rainer\r\n\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 1126, "added": "2009-02-09T03:19:55", "slug": "cornerstones", "speakers": [{"id": 7962, "name": "Chantal Pontbriand", "slug": "chantal-pontbriand"}], "topics": [{"id": 608, "name": "contemporary", "path": "/arts/literature/francophone/poetry/contemporary"}, {"id": 612, "name": "contemporary", "path": "/arts/books/poetry/french/contemporary"}, {"id": 925, "name": "lecture", "path": "/arts/music/classical/lecture"}, {"id": 1073, "name": "contemporary", "path": "/arts/curating/contemporary"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 1843, "name": "Witte de With", "slug": "witte-de-with", "city": "Rotterdam", "postcode": "301 2BR"}, "organizer": {"id": 1843, "name": "Witte de With", "slug": "witte-de-with"}, "date": "2009-02-26", "dates": [{"id": 6659, "from_date": "2009-02-26", "to_date": "2009-02-26", "time": "19:00:00", "ticket_cost": "€10,- (reduced price €7,-)", "ticket_info": "reservations@wdw.nl\r\n", "additional_info": "Prior to every Cornerstones lecture, Witte de With’s exhibition will remain open between 6 p.m. and 7 p.m.\r\n", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 1843, "name": "Witte de With", "slug": "witte-de-with", "city": "Rotterdam", "postcode": "301 2BR"}, "organizer": {"id": 1843, "name": "Witte de With", "slug": "witte-de-with"}}]}, {"id": 6411, "title": "The Dunhuang Star Chart: An early view of the Chinese Sky", "synopsis": "Lecture by Dr. Susan Whitfield and Jean-Marc Bonnet-Bidaud", "keywords": "Star chart China", "body": "A special lecture to celebrate the 2009 International Year of Astronomy jointly organised by the Royal Asiatic Society and the International Dunhuang Project", "additional_info": null, "duration": 60, "image_id": null, "added": "2009-01-28T12:37:07", "slug": "the-dunhuang-star-chart-an-early-view-of-the-chinese-sky", "speakers": [{"id": 8040, "name": "Dr. Susan Whitfield", "slug": "dr-susan-whitfield"}, {"id": 8041, "name": "Professor Jean-Marc Bonnet-Bidaud", "slug": "professor-jean-marc-bonnet-bidaud"}], "topics": [{"id": 996, "name": "china", "path": "/academic/history/china"}, {"id": 1385, "name": "history", "path": "/academic/astronomy/history"}], "supercategory": "academic", "venue": {"id": 1736, "name": "Royal Asiatic Society", "slug": "royal-asiatic-society", "city": "London", "postcode": "NW1 2HD"}, "organizer": {"id": 1736, "name": "Royal Asiatic Society", "slug": "royal-asiatic-society"}, "date": "2009-02-10", "dates": [{"id": 6725, "from_date": "2009-02-10", "to_date": "2009-02-10", "time": "18:30:00", "ticket_cost": "free", "ticket_info": null, "additional_info": "Nearest tube Euston, Euston Square, Warren Street.\r\n0207 388 4539", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 1736, "name": "Royal Asiatic Society", "slug": "royal-asiatic-society", "city": "London", "postcode": "NW1 2HD"}, "organizer": {"id": 1736, "name": "Royal Asiatic Society", "slug": "royal-asiatic-society"}}]}, {"id": 6106, "title": "Golem-Building for Dummies: Practicalities, Texts and Principles from Jewish Lore", "synopsis": "the history of golems from a Jewish perspective, materials and meditative techniques used in the construction of a Golem", "keywords": "golem, jewish, kabbalah", "body": "The legend of the Golem predates the stories surrounding the Maharal of Prague in the 16th century to the 2nd and 3rd centuries in the Persian Empire.

The short lived freedom to access archive documents and to publish objective research during the Gorbachev and Yeltsin years has been superseded by the rewriting of history under Putin – ideological dogmatism, on the pretext of fostering Russian patriotism and pride in Russia’s past. The revelations and decisions of Khrushchev at the 20th and 21st Congresses of the CPSU are seen as a slander on the glorious Soviet past. There has been a complete rethinking of the attitudes to Stalin, to the collectivisation of agriculture, to genocide within the Soviet population, to World War II, to the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact, to the occupation of the Baltic States, to the Yalta Agreement etc. A sinister situation – the sanitisation of Stalin!\r\n\r\nDr. Arkady Vaksberg, a hero of our time, is a writer, world famous journalist, historian and Doctor of Law. He spent 20 years at the Moscow Bar for the defence in many trials in Soviet cities. From 1973 he became the renowned columnist for Literaturnaya Gazeta – the paper’s circulation soared to 7.5 million, due to his ‘Courtroom Sketches’. Pushing the limits of what was possible under press censorship he exposed incidences of corruption, abuses of power, suppressions of human rights, and interference with judicial independence. It was he who coined the phrase ‘law by telephone’, a term which has entered the Russian political vocabulary. He is the author of plays, film scripts, and over forty books, including “The Prosecutor and his Prey – The Life of Andrei Vyshinsky”, “The Soviet Mafia”, “Stalin against the Jews”, “The Murder of Maxim Gorky”. Some of these, like his latest book Le Laboratoire des Poisons (Paris 2008), revealing individual events of political terror in Soviet and post Soviet Russia, could be published only outside Russia. Arkady Vaksberg now resides in France. \r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 120, "image_id": null, "added": "2008-09-18T08:30:18", "slug": "07715888fe068a88", "speakers": [{"id": 7320, "name": "Arkady Vaksberg", "slug": "arkady-vaksberg"}], "topics": [{"id": 106, "name": "wwi", "path": "/arts/books/history/military/wwi"}, {"id": 107, "name": "wwii", "path": "/arts/books/history/military/wwii"}, {"id": 108, "name": "army", "path": "/arts/books/history/military/army"}, {"id": 109, "name": "navy", "path": "/arts/books/history/military/navy"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 1708, "name": "Pushkin House", "slug": "pushkin-house", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC1A 2TA"}, "organizer": {"id": 1708, "name": "Pushkin House", "slug": "pushkin-house"}, "date": "2008-10-20", "dates": [{"id": 6109, "from_date": "2008-10-20", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "19:00:00", "ticket_cost": "£5", "ticket_info": "tom.lorimer@pushkinhouse.org.uk", "additional_info": null, "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 1708, "name": "Pushkin House", "slug": "pushkin-house", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC1A 2TA"}, "organizer": {"id": 1708, "name": "Pushkin House", "slug": "pushkin-house"}}]}, {"id": 5634, "title": "At the Time of Darwin and Africa Weaponry", "synopsis": "Influential Plymothians and African items from the collections.", "keywords": "arts/ethnography\r\narts/history", "body": "Take a look at some of the influential Plymothians who were active during the time of Darwin's studies with Carole Longville and Mary Cobbledick.

", "keywords": "Ideology, Cinema", "body": "When we are dealing with a problem which is undoubtedly a real one, its ideological designation-perception introduces an invisible mystification. For example, tolerance designates a real problem – how can one be for intolerance towards foreigners, for antifeminism, for homophobia? But what should be against is the (today's automatic) perception of racism as a problem of tolerance: why are so many problems today perceived as problems of intolerance, rather than as problems of inequality, exploitation, or injustice? Why is the proposed remedy tolerance, rather than emancipation, political struggle, even armed struggle? Such mystification is not a matter of sophisticated argumentation: it is part of our spontaneous everyday understanding of ideology – like the journalists who report embedded with the US forces in Iraq, we are all embedded in ideology. Since one of the privileged mechanisms which (re)produce this everyday ideology is cinema, the course will focus on the analysis of today’s cinema – not only Hollywood and not only popular cinema: from 300 to The Hero, from Da Vinci Code to Perfume, from The Fall of Berlin to Sacrifice, from United 93 to World Trade Center, from Taxi Driver to The Fugitive – The class will have 5 sessions: four lectures and a general debate.\r\n\r\n1.

How dangerous are the physical effects of space travel and how does your body cope with them?\r\n\r\nMark Shuttleworth, the second tourist into space, will share his own experiences of space travel, Natasha Loder, The Economist aerospace journalist, will discuss the recent developments in commercial space travel and the expectations of future space tourists and Andrew Smith author of Moondust will provide an insight into the life-changing experiences of lunar astronauts and question whether space tourism would feel the same.\r\n\r\n2005 is fast becoming the year of science fiction, and now the Science Museum’s Dana Centre is launching a series of debates to explore the fact and fiction behind one of the nation’s best-loved sci-fi classics, The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, as the Science Museum launches its major Hitchhiker’s exhibition.\r\n\r\nSince the 1950s science fiction has marvelled at the weird and wonderful possibilities of science, including time-travel, teleportation, androids and aliens.  But how much of this speculation has become science fact? \r\n\r\nThe events at the Dana Centre – London’s only venue for adults to discuss contemporary and controversial science – will take experts from a variety of fields to explore artificial intelligence, space tourism and the science of Hitchhiker’s through three evenings of informal discussion and debate.\r\n\r\nEach evening will raise a range of perplexing questions including: Which ideas in science fiction have been developed further in true scientific research and development? Could a robot eventually have human feelings and emotions and should developments like these be encouraged or suppressed? What would it feel like to be a space tourist?\r\n\r\nThe Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy Exhibition opens at the Science Museum on 28 May. The exhibition has been specially created by the Museum and makers of the new movie, recreating the fantastic voyage of Arthur Dent, and along the way exploring some of the science which shapes our lives, the universe and everything.", "additional_info": null, "duration": 120, "image_id": 130, "added": "2005-05-31T12:01:41", "slug": "the-hitchhikers-guide-to-space-tourism", "speakers": [{"id": 2512, "name": "Andrew Smith", "slug": "andrew-smith"}, {"id": 2511, "name": "The second tourist into space Mark Shuttleworth", "slug": "the-second-tourist-into-space-mark-shuttleworth"}, {"id": 2510, "name": "The Economist aerospace journa Natasha Loder", "slug": "the-economist-aerospace-journa-natasha-loder"}], "topics": [{"id": 170, "name": "newtopic", "path": "/science/chemistry/biochemistry/catalysis/newtopic"}, {"id": 169, "name": "catalysis", "path": "/science/chemistry/biochemistry/catalysis"}, {"id": 431, "name": "science", "path": "/arts/books/science"}, {"id": 487, "name": "science", "path": "/leisure/reading/science"}], "supercategory": "science", "venue": {"id": 15, "name": "Dana Centre", "slug": "dana-centre", "city": "London", "postcode": "SW7 5HE"}, "organizer": {"id": 46, "name": "Science Museum", "slug": "science-museum"}, "date": "2005-06-07", "dates": [{"id": 2018, "from_date": "2005-06-07", "to_date": "2005-06-07", "time": "19:00:00", "ticket_cost": "FREE", "ticket_info": "Tickets are FREE but must be pre-booked on: 020 7942 4040 or tickets@danacentre.org.uk", "additional_info": null, "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 15, "name": "Dana Centre", "slug": "dana-centre", "city": "London", "postcode": "SW7 5HE"}, "organizer": {"id": 46, "name": "Science Museum", "slug": "science-museum"}}]}, {"id": 1934, "title": "Outside Looking In", "synopsis": "Presented by:\t  \r\nResCen, Centre for Research into Creation in the Performing Arts,Middlesex University", "keywords": "ResCen", "body": "ResCen \r\n(Centre for Research into Creation in the Performing Arts)\r\nMiddlesex University \r\n\r\nis pleased to announce a one day seminar event\r\n\r\n‘Outside Looking In’\r\n\r\nWednesday 15 June 2005\r\n\r\nat\r\n\r\nConway Hall\r\n25 Red Lion Square\r\nLondon WC1\r\nwww.conwayhall.org\r\n(nearest Tube station: Holborn)\r\n\r\n\r\nDay event: \t\t\t11.30am – 5.30pm\r\nA series of workshops, discussions and presentations led by each of the Research Associate Artists\r\n\r\nEntrance: \t\t\t\t£10 \r\nthis includes lunch and refreshments\r\npayable by cheque to Middlesex University\r\n\r\nEvening event: \t\t6-8pm\r\nA seminar discussion with all six Research Associate Artists led by Chris Bannerman\r\n\r\nEntrance:\t\t\t\tFree\r\n\r\nPlaces for the day and evening events are limited and on a first come first served basis \r\nSo to register your interest and ask for a booking form, please contact Natalie Daniel.

These discussions inform a series of external public seminars.\r\n‘Outside Looking In' is the last public seminar that ResCen is organising for this academic year.  It marks a key point in ResCen’s research programme as we embark on a series of published outcomes over the next academic year.  To this end, the format of this public event is different from previous seminars.  \r\n\r\n‘Outside Looking In’ is a series of daytime workshops, discussions and presentations that are led by each of the Research Associate Artists.  These sessions reflect the broad range of practices and research of the six ResCen artists including: Errollyn Wallen’s hands-on workshop ‘Instant Composing’ in which participants explore issues of intuition in composing; Richard Layzell’s ‘Engaging with Absence’ which includes a discussion and demonstration with Research Fellow Joshua Sofaer on the role of other selves and other voices in the creative process.  Other sessions will include choreographic workshop demonstrations as well as presentations and discussions on telepresence and remote connection in artistic practice. \r\n\r\nThe evening session includes the presentation of a paper ‘Intuition and craft: an eyewitness account’ by Professor Chris Bannerman with Rosemary Lee and Graeme Miller.  This will be followed by further discussion and debate about key issues that have arisen throughout the day.\r\n\r\nQuestions and discussion are encouraged throughout the daytime workshops and the evening seminar as well as afterwards on our online forum at www.rescen.net\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur most recent seminars are available to view on the\r\nResCen website:\r\nwww.rescen.net\r\n\r\nThis event is supported by NESTA\r\n\r\nNESTA is the National Endowment for Science, Technology and the Arts, the organisation that invests in UK creativity and innovation.

It will focus on some of the major changes in social and medical responses to those who were termed variously ‘mad’, ‘lunatic’, ‘distracted’, ‘demented’, or merely ‘nervous’. Where previously the ‘mad’ has been mostly cared by their families within their communities, increasingly institutional and medical solutions were sought. These transitions will be linked with the changing social attitudes to insanity in the period 1900.\r\n\r\n\r\nJonathan Andrews is a Research Associate, specialising in the History of Medicine, at Oxford Brookes University. He has published widely in the history of psychiatry, including (jointly authored) A History of Bethlem (Routledge, 1997); They’re in the Trade of Lunacy (Wellcome Institute, 1998); (with Andrew Scull), Undertaker of the Mind (University of California Press, 2001) and Customers and Patrons of the Mad Trade (University of California Press, 2003) and (with Anne Digby) Sex and Seclusion, Class and Custody (Rodopi, 2004). He is reviews editor of the journal History of Psychiatry, and on the advisory editorial board of that journal and of the Journal of Forensic Psychiatry. He is currently working on criminal insanity in Britain during ca. 1860-1913.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnless otherwise noted, lectures start at 5.30, last one hour and take place in the Curtis Auditorium, Herschel Building, which sits directly across the road from Haymarket Metro Station.
