The talks are open to students, staff and general public.\r\n\r\nThis Masterclass will be hosted by Mary Ballantyne. Mary was born in Holytown, Scotland in 1961. She recently retired as Vice President of Site Operations for a leading global Life Sciences business and is now enjoying Consulting with businesses on growth and business improvement strategies as well as supporting start up business and mentoring/coaching their founders and directors.\r\n\r\nAll this following a successful career as a Registered Nurse. Like many nurses before her, pursuing a nursing career came first. Specialising in Nursing within the critical care areas of Operating Theatres, A/E and ICU (unscheduled care) with the addition of academic qualifications and experience consolidating this. Academic lecturing and leading academic modules/programme experience were to follow a little later in life.\r\n\r\nIn the USA, she was part of a successful ground-breaking team developing new technologies and surgical techniques with the introduction of Laparoscopic ‘key hole’ surgery to the UK in the late 1980’s early 1990s. This work is being showcased in Dundee Science Centre currently as part of the medical Marvels exhibition.\r\n\r\nThe life sciences sector was the next challenge really allowing Mary's entrepreneurial flair to flourish. Joining a failing business in need of structure and process as well as requiring the build of a resilient team who would push the limits of science (by developing a global reputation in Toxicology) and business. Mary then went on to finally join 4 other businesses which were acquired for a value more than £160million.\r\n\r\nNurses are entrepreneurs who see a “need” for something every minute of every day. They find new ways to solve problems and can create value. They methodically analyze and put their patients first and to the center of everything they do.", "additional_info": null, "duration": 60, "image_id": 2785, "added": "2018-11-07T14:02:58", "slug": "entrepreneurial-masterclass-with-mary-ballantyne", "speakers": [{"id": 16888, "name": "Mary  Ballantyne", "slug": "mary-ballantyne"}], "topics": [{"id": 3600, "name": "health", "path": "/arts/education/creativity/health"}, {"id": 483, "name": "masterclass", "path": "/music/appreciation/masterclass"}, {"id": 4405, "name": "healthcare", "path": "/science/engineering/healthcare"}, {"id": 3889, "name": "nursing", "path": "/science/nursing/nursing"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 3474, "name": "School of Nursing and Health Sciences", "slug": "school-of-nursing-and-health-sciences", "city": "Kirkcaldy", "postcode": "KY2 5YS"}, "organizer": {"id": 3462, "name": "Centre of Entrepreneurship, University of Dundee", "slug": "centre-of-entrepreneurship-university-of-dundee"}, "date": "2018-11-07", "dates": [{"id": 16865, "from_date": "2018-11-07", "to_date": "2018-11-07", "time": "1 day, 0:00:00", "ticket_cost": "FREE", "ticket_info": "https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/entrepreneurial-masterclass-with-mary-ballantyne-tickets-50609423147", "additional_info": null, "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 3474, "name": "School of Nursing and Health Sciences", "slug": "school-of-nursing-and-health-sciences", "city": "Kirkcaldy", "postcode": "KY2 5YS"}, "organizer": {"id": 3462, "name": "Centre of Entrepreneurship, University of Dundee", "slug": "centre-of-entrepreneurship-university-of-dundee"}}]}, {"id": 16118, "title": "Kate Adie and Frank Gardner in conversation", "synopsis": "In a conversation chaired by Yalda Hakim, Kate Adie and Frank Gardner discuss their experiences of reporting on the Army.", "keywords": "Special Forces, Defence, Security", "body": "Chaired by BBC World News correspondent, Yalda Hakim, this conversation will explore the relationship between journalism and the Army.

If the 1950s and 1960s were characterized by a romanticizing, pro-Zionist alignment with Israel, mainly expressed by Social-democratic parties and trade unions, the rise of the New Left after 1968 considerably changed the perspectives on the Middle East con&#64258;ict and eventually had an impact on wider sections of the political left.

It will examine the origins of church schools as typified by the Grey Coat Hospital School in Westminster and how the earliest private schools were also religious foundations (St Paul’s and Westminster). The beginnings of government education with the 1870 Education Act led to the Board Schools, the vast, red-brick, arts and craft buildings, across the country. These were designed to be as light and airy as possible to counter the gloomy, unhealthy conditions of the workhouse – such as the surviving one in Fitzrovia, which inspired Dickens to write Oliver Twist. The City of London School was built in 1834, on the actual site of the old London Workhouse. Universities came late to London: from University College London (1826) to King’s College London (1829). UCL was expressly founded as a secular alternative to Oxbridge. The story of London University echoes the expansion of British universities in general. Over the years, London University has sprouted new extensions – including the Courtauld Institute, now in neo-classical Somerset House.\r\n\r\nThe walk on 08 FEB will be around Westminster.\r\n\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 120, "image_id": null, "added": "2016-06-06T11:04:52", "slug": "how-london-became-the-greatest-city-on-earth-66", "speakers": [{"id": 16217, "name": "Harry Mount", "slug": "harry-mount"}], "topics": [{"id": 131, "name": "authors", "path": "/arts/literature/fiction/british/21stcentury/authors"}, {"id": 106, "name": "wwi", "path": "/arts/books/history/military/wwi"}, {"id": 107, "name": "wwii", "path": "/arts/books/history/military/wwii"}, {"id": 108, "name": "army", "path": "/arts/books/history/military/army"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 2725, "name": "The University Women's Club", "slug": "the-university-womens-club", "city": "London", "postcode": "W1K 1DB"}, "organizer": {"id": 2290, "name": "THE COURSE", "slug": "the-course"}, "date": "2017-02-01", "dates": [{"id": 15969, "from_date": "2017-02-01", "to_date": "2017-02-01", "time": "10:45:00", "ticket_cost": "£54.00", "ticket_info": "info@thecoursestudies.co.uk", "additional_info": "visit www.thecoursestudies.co.uk", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 2725, "name": "The University Women's Club", "slug": "the-university-womens-club", "city": "London", "postcode": "W1K 1DB"}, "organizer": {"id": 2290, "name": "THE COURSE", "slug": "the-course"}}]}, {"id": 15378, "title": "London is the Place for me, The James Berry Archive", "synopsis": "Hannah Lowe, Myra Barrs, Susanna Howard, Raymond Antrobus and Philip Cowell offer insights into his life and work.", "keywords": "Literature, music, liming,", "body": "Hannah Lowe, Myra Barrs, Susanna Howard, Raymond Antrobus and Philip Cowell offer insights into his life and work.

This paper presents data from a larger study (Cameron and Shaw 2016) that undertook a linguistic analysis of the leaders’ high-profile performances in two televised election debates to assess the extent to which they speak in the ‘different voice’ of consensus and cooperation that has been claimed to be typical of women in politics. Our findings indicate that party status rather than gender determined the leaders’ occupation of the debate floor and that this, together with a high degree of variability in communicative styles between men and between women indicates that the leaders’ performances represent a more complex and individual pattern of participation than the women’s ‘different voice’ ideology would suggest.\r\n\r\nSylvia Shaw is a sociolinguist who conducts research in the field of gender and language, and is particularly interested in language, gender and politics.

She will try to put the dramatic events of recent days into the longer historical context and ask what they mean for our relationship with Russia. \r\n\r\nThis public discussion will be recorded and will be broadcast at 8.00pm on Saturday 8 March, on BBC Radio 4| (@BBCRadio4|). \r\n\r\nAnne Applebaum (@anneapplebaum|) is the author of, among other books, Putinism: The Ideology; Iron Curtain: The Crushing of Eastern Europe, 1944-1956; Between East and West: Across the Borderlands of Europe; and Gulag: A History.  She is currently writing a history of Ukraine. Anne was the Philippe Roman Chair in History and International Affairs at LSE for the 2012-13 academic year.  \r\n\r\nBen Judah (@b_judah|) is a Russianist and published last year, Fragile Empire: How Russia Fell In and Out of Love with Vladimir Putin. Ben is an associate fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations. \r\n\r\nBridget Kendall is the BBC's diplomatic correspondent and former Moscow correspondent. \r\n\r\nSuggested hashtag for this event for Twitter users: #LSEUkraine \r\n\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 732, "added": "2014-03-03T15:01:01", "slug": "russia-ukraine-and-us", "speakers": [{"id": 12830, "name": "Professor Anne Applebaum ", "slug": "professor-anne-applebaum"}, {"id": 14533, "name": "Ben Judah", "slug": "ben-judah"}, {"id": 7576, "name": "Chair: Bridget Kendall", "slug": "chair-bridget-kendall"}], "topics": [{"id": 2095, "name": "russia", "path": "/arts/history/worldhistory/russia"}, {"id": 2391, "name": "russia", "path": "/arts/literature/history/russia"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 2221, "name": "Sheikh Zayed Theatre", "slug": "sheikh-zayed-theatre", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC2A 2AE"}, "organizer": {"id": 1287, "name": "London School of Economics & Political Science", "slug": "london-school-of-economics-political-science"}, "date": "2014-03-07", "dates": [{"id": 14014, "from_date": "2014-03-07", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "18:00:00", "ticket_cost": "FREE", "ticket_info": "This event is free and open to all however a ticket is required, only one ticket per person can be requested. \r\n\r\nLSE students and staff are able to collect one ticket per person from the New Academic Building SU shop, located on the Kingsway side of the building from 10am on Tuesday 4 March.

Hailed internationally as one of the key figures exploring the extremes of electronic music/sound exploration, he has worked on an incredible array of projects, performances and collaborations. He has collaborated with, among others, Aphex Twin, Jake and Dinos Chapman, Florian Hecker, Earth, Popol Vuh, Kjetil Manheim, Carsten Höller, Mika Vainio, Carl Michael von Hausswolff, Masami Akita, Peter Rehberg, Zbigniew Karkowski, Gescom, Yasunao Tone and Whitehouse. In 2002 his debut compact disc Live Salvage 1997-2000 (Mego) received Prix Ars Electronica's Honorable Mention for Digital Music. As well as his sonic projects, Haswell has continued to work as a writer, visual artist and curator. His extensive curating credits include a series of major projects at P.S.1/MOMA, New York, two All Tomorrow's Parties club events in London, entitled 'Easy to Swallow' (2005-2006), and LISTEN at Aldeburgh Snape Maltings Concert House (2009). As a writer, He has contributed to Frieze articles on Japanese noise, computer music software and Peter Halley.\r\n\r\nJapanese-American artist, writer, theorist and composer Yasunao Tone, born in 1935, is, according to writer Alan Cummings, 'part of a whole generation of post-war iconoclasts who followed in the wake of John Cage's discovery of indeterminacy, determined to shake music and art out of their enslavement to the high art, romanticist ideals of the 19th century'. Coming to prominence in the early 1960s, Tone was a co-founder of Group Ongaku and one of Fluxus, the NY Downtown improvisers and European electronica experimentalists. He calls his work Paramedia Art, and his work includes interventions with prepared CDs and MP3 systems. He received the Prix Ars Electronica's Golden Nica award in 2002 and a grant from the Foundation for Contemporary Arts in 2004.\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 120, "image_id": null, "added": "2013-08-03T05:20:23", "slug": "park-nights", "speakers": [{"id": 5740, "name": "Russell Haswell", "slug": "russell-haswell"}, {"id": 13890, "name": "Yasunao  Tone", "slug": "yasunao-tone"}], "topics": [], "supercategory": "academic", "venue": {"id": 166, "name": "Serpentine Galleries", "slug": "serpentine-galleries", "city": "London", "postcode": "W2 3XA"}, "organizer": {"id": 166, "name": "Serpentine Galleries", "slug": "serpentine-galleries"}, "date": "2013-09-06", "dates": [{"id": 13206, "from_date": "2013-09-06", "to_date": "2013-09-06", "time": "20:00:00", "ticket_cost": "£5/4", "ticket_info": "Available at the Gallery Lobby Desk or Ticketweb: 08444 711 000, www.ticketweb.co.uk", "additional_info": null, "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 166, "name": "Serpentine Galleries", "slug": "serpentine-galleries", "city": "London", "postcode": "W2 3XA"}, "organizer": {"id": 166, "name": "Serpentine Galleries", "slug": "serpentine-galleries"}}]}, {"id": 12493, "title": "Brief therapy skills for stopping addictions – a skills-based day", "synopsis": "New ideas and techniques from various schools of brief, solution-focused therapy are showing that it is possible to help most addicts transform their lives in a small number of sessions.", "keywords": "addiction, alcoholism, mental health, psychology, therapy, counselling, psychotherapy, substance misuse, drugs, eating disorders, gambling", "body": "As the number of people affected by addiction continues to rise, its treatment is undergoing a revolution.\r\n\r\nNew ideas and techniques from various schools of brief, solution-focused therapy are showing that it is possible to help most addicts transform their lives in a small number of sessions.\r\n\r\nAt Joe Griffin's practical training day – which complements his course 'Addiction: Understanding how to stop addictive behaviour' – you will learn and practise the powerful skills derived from the human givens approach (which organically integrates the best brief therapy techniques) that are helping people overcome a wide range of addictions, including: alcoholism, heroin, smoking, gambling, sex and eating disorders.\r\n\r\nThese skills are essential if you wish to improve your effectiveness when working with any addiction.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.humangivenscollege.com/courses/stopping-addictions-skillspractice.html", "additional_info": null, "duration": 480, "image_id": 1908, "added": "2013-04-24T21:03:39", "slug": "da24efc5eb70c5bf", "speakers": [{"id": 9481, "name": "Joe Griffin", "slug": "joe-griffin"}], "topics": [{"id": 508, "name": "alcoholism", "path": "/society/health/alcoholism"}, {"id": 2035, "name": "addiction", "path": "/science/psychology/addiction"}, {"id": 2036, "name": "psychotherapy", "path": "/science/psychology/psychotherapy"}, {"id": 2163, "name": "therapy", "path": "/arts/finearts/therapy"}], "supercategory": "society", "venue": {"id": 941, "name": "Friends Meeting House", "slug": "friends-meeting-house", "city": "London", "postcode": "NW1 2BJ"}, "organizer": {"id": 2602, "name": "Human Givens College", "slug": "human-givens-college"}, "date": "2013-09-12", "dates": [{"id": 12967, "from_date": "2013-09-12", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "9:30:00", "ticket_cost": "£192", "ticket_info": "Human Givens College\r\nwww.humangivenscollege.com\r\n01323 811690", "additional_info": "http://www.humangivenscollege.com/courses/stopping-addictions-skillspractice.html", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 941, "name": "Friends Meeting House", "slug": "friends-meeting-house", "city": "London", "postcode": "NW1 2BJ"}, "organizer": {"id": 2602, "name": "Human Givens College", "slug": "human-givens-college"}}]}, {"id": 12276, "title": "Developing new solar cells - cheaper, or more efficient?", "synopsis": "Kavli Medal and Lecture by Professor Neil Greenham, University of Cambridge", "keywords": "renewable energy, solar power, technology, materials, physics, engineering, polymers, nano, semiconductors", "body": "This lecture will describe how the performance of solar cells can be improved to offer a feasible way of installing solar power on an affordable scale.

As performing and visual arts organisations are transforming relationships with audiences, more varied roles have emerged for curators beyond exhibition making and collections management. Curating has evolved to embrace audience-generated content. Many curators see their role more and more as a cultural producer.\r\n\r\nThe panel will examine an evolving definition of contemporary curation within their practices, and their relationships to the cities and people around them. Is an architect who arranges and designs spaces or the city a curator? Is a curator an architect of sorts producing spaces of exchange? What about the work a writer or researcher does in 'curating' arguments and ideas? Finally, how does the increasing importance of the everyday, of the street, and of shifting political geographies of art practice mark curation today? \r\n\r\nClémentine Deliss is director of Weltkulturen Museum, Frankfurt am Main since April 2010.

Decisions to attend school seem subject to peer effects and time-inconsistent preferences. Merit scholarships, school health programs, and information about returns to education can all cost-effectively spur school participation. However, distortions in education systems, such as weak teacher incentives and elite-oriented curricula, undermine learning in school and much of the impact of increasing existing educational spending. Pedagogical innovations designed to address these distortions (such as technology-assisted instruction, remedial education, and tracking by achievement) can raise test scores at a low cost. Merely informing parents about school conditions seems insufficient to improve teacher incentives, and evidence on merit pay is mixed, but hiring teachers locally on short-term contracts can save money and improve educational outcomes. School vouchers can cost-effectively increase both school participation and learning. \r\n\r\nMichael Kremer is the Gates Professor of Developing Societies in the Department of Economics at Harvard University and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.  \r\n\r\nGeeta Kingdon is chair of Education Economics and International Development at the Institute of Education.  \r\n\r\nLansana Nyalley is Deputy Minister in the Education Division of the Government of Sierra Leone. \r\n\r\nJames Tooley is professor of Education Policy at Newcastle University. \r\n\r\nThis public event is part of Growth Week 2010, a three-day conference organised by the International Growth Centre (IGC).

It was workers, Jews, and immigrants – people on the margins of society – who from an early stage shaped professional football both as players and managers.

Ethics isn’t much help either – it can help us describe the values people hold but it doesn’t really help us adjudicate between contending positions.  At the core of the debates are some fundamental questions about ‘human nature’, and our relations with the rest of the animate (and inanimate) world.  One currently topical approach (biophilia) illustrates the 'sociobiological' paradigm in science but this doesn't help us much more than the (now distinctly unfashionable) 'group selection' explanation for human altruism - to each other or to the natural world.  Instead, the most fruitful approaches to our (environmental) future lie in our own (biological and social) history, exploration of which is - together with a better understanding of the natural world - the most worthwhile, productive and enjoyable endeavour that we can engage with. History provides some useful perspectives because ultimately conservation is concerned with people’s relationships – with each other as well as with nature.

This newfound passion for understanding the world around us through experiment and demonstration brought people we would now recognise as scientists to the public attention and crystallised in the establishment of the Royal Society in 1660. \r\n\r\nAdriano Shaplin and Simon Schaffer, Professor of History at the University of Cambridge and co-author of Leviathan and the air pump: Hobbes, Boyle and the experimental life, will discuss the germination of the play and expand on how it reflects the history of the period.  Adriano and Simon will recount the major struggle between men such as Robert Hooke and Robert Boyle who sought knowledge through experimentation and Hobbes, a well-known and influential philosopher. It was this struggle that saw the value of experimentation, a central part of modern science, come to the fore.\r\n\r\nFor many it would be assumed that the headline name at the time would have been Isaac Newton.  A widely recognised figure he has even appeared on our bank notes but Adriano and Simon will recount how people such as Hooke and Boyle played a key part in the emergence of modern science.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Shakespeare Company play is being performed at Wilton's Music Hall, which nestles in the streets that provide the backdrop against which the story is told.  The story explores the growth of public scientific demonstrations and debate and pits Thomas Hobbes, England's most famous philosopher of the time against a group of young scientists led by Robert Hooke and Robert Boyle as philosophy and science battle it out for the public's attention.\r\n\r\nThe Tragedy of Thomas Hobbes is at Wilton's Music Hall from 12 November to 6 December 2008.

Of course, the emphasis is typically intended as an ontological as much as a moral one. The reference to the individual aims to give politics a secure foundation in reality, and, so the argument goes, the real foundations of human forms of life are individuals and their families, not societies. \r\n\r\nIn the forms of life characteristic of the West today have we got the balance between the individual and society right? Why do we find it so hard to agree the boundaries of personal freedom and collective responsibility? And is the West indeed guilty of privileging the individual at the expense of society? In this panel discussion the Forum for European Philosophy is collaborating with the new culture and politics magazine Standpoint to explore a fundamental question about the Western image of the individual and its implications for our lives with others. \r\n\r\nJohn Cottingham is professor of philosophy at the University of Reading.

The postulates of geometry are of surfaces without thickness and volumes without substance. They are immaterial. In attempting to translate this information into physical objects, situations or environments, then any surface must have a thickness and therefore a volume, and any closed surface must have a volume or a wall thickness. The paradoxes that can occur through this translation are of particular interest for me, forming an initial point of departure, rather than a frustration.\r\n\r\nMy primary concerns have remained with the coding, distribution and orientation of edge, surface, volume and space through the use of projective, descriptive and topological geometries, and predominately (since 1985) with extending my 'Impingement' series of architectonic drawings - large scale immaterial forms thrown onto the given environment. The first of these works were resolved through the development of simple 3-D drawing machines that could generate spheres and ellipsoids, and could to some extent draw around corners. These were extended by the incorporation of lasers and precision positioning instruments that offered accurate planar configurations and allowed for a larger scale. Around 1996, 3-D computer programs became more useful, predominately as a ‘sketchbook’ space where concepts and configurations could be developed. More complex curvilinear forms could be explored, although initial studies could only be realised in model form. Later, thorough site measurements of rectilinear architecture were taken in order to build reasonably accurate computer models of potential sites. Once the ‘impingement’ form was determined, a full scale paper pattern of all the flat surfaces of the site (floors, walls, ceilings, windows) could be printed with all lines of intersection located. A lot of paper, and slow in most cases, but it works. My current research is in establishing a broader range of methods for measuring the more complex and eccentric elements of architectural form, and then establishing a means of projecting the modified information back onto the site.", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": null, "added": "2007-04-17T19:18:10", "slug": "46a583cdc4ed9b05", "speakers": [{"id": 5383, "name": "Gary Woodley", "slug": "gary-woodley"}], "topics": [{"id": 385, "name": "architecture", "path": "/arts/museums/architecture"}, {"id": 493, "name": "drawing", "path": "/arts/finearts/drawing"}, {"id": 844, "name": "drawing", "path": "/arts/art/drawing"}, {"id": 724, "name": "mathematics", "path": "/science/engineering/mathematics"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 650, "name": "London Knowledge Lab", "slug": "london-knowledge-lab", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC1N 3QS"}, "organizer": {"id": 650, "name": "London Knowledge Lab", "slug": "london-knowledge-lab"}, "date": "2007-04-17", "dates": [{"id": 4441, "from_date": "2007-04-17", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "6:00:00", "ticket_cost": "0.00", "ticket_info": null, "additional_info": null, "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 650, "name": "London Knowledge Lab", "slug": "london-knowledge-lab", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC1N 3QS"}, "organizer": {"id": 650, "name": "London Knowledge Lab", "slug": "london-knowledge-lab"}}]}, {"id": 3994, "title": "Frontline Confidential with John Willis –Cover–ups and Double Standards in the Asbestos Industry", "synopsis": "One of Britain’s best-known documentary-makers, John Willis, talks about his investigation into asbestos–related cancer and how the programme he made changed attitudes towards this dangerous mineral.", "keywords": "Asbestos, John Willis, science, medical, journalism", "body": "One of Britain’s best-known documentary-makers, John Willis, talks about his investigation into asbestos–related cancer and how the programme he made changed attitudes towards this dangerous mineral.\r\n\r\nAlice - A Fight for Life told the story of cover-ups and double standards in the asbestos industry set against one woman’s fight with asbestos-related cancer.\r\n\r\nImmediately following the programme shares in the asbestos industry fell by £60 million and the government reduced the levels of asbestos permissible in factories.\r\n\r\nJohn Willis talks about the power of research, the unusual mix of emotion and investigation and his fight against the industry.\r\n\r\nWillis started out at Yorkshire Television where he won countless awards for his investigative documentaries, including Alice - A Fight for Life.\r\n\r\nIn 1988 he joined Channel 4 as Controller of Factual Programmes and five years later moved up to be Director of Programmes.\r\n\r\nSince then he has worked as chief executive at United Productions, sat on the Boards of both ITN and Channel 5 and worked as director of Factual and Learning Programmes at the BBC.\r\n\r\nLate last year he became chief executive of Mentorn Productions who make Question Time for the BBC, editions of Dispatches for Channel 4 and high impact factual drama like The Government Inspector and The Trial of Tony Blair.\r\n\r\nThe event is organised in association with the Centre for Investigative Journalism.\r\n\r\nBooking essential.

Back in 1997, tired of saving hundreds of handwritten student surveys and having to present students with generalisations about English dialects that ceased being true 75 years ago, I decided to create an engine for collecting linguistic survey data via the web. My hope was to collect up-to-date dialect data and lots of it, in a form that could be directly dumped into a database for statistical analysis and geographic visualisation. Nine years and about eight surveys later, a host of interesting and surprising results have emerged concerning the current form of English varieties around the world. A number of unanticipated challenges have arisen as well.

From microelectronic components to power stations, machines consisting of little more than tubes of oscillating fluids may soon appear as pumps, compressors, coolers and mini power plants, and without moving parts there ’s not much to go wrong. Until recently, thermofluidic engines have been limited to very few applications. Without heavy pistons, flywheels and springs, it appeared that the inertia of the working fluid itself provided the only means of controlling these machines, and most fluids don’t have a lot of it! Thomas has discovered that the key may lie in understanding how heat and fluid flows can interact to eliminate the dependence on inertia. He has designed and built engines that can pump water to the top of a two-story building, ate balloons and irrigate the crops of the worlds poorest people. They can start and stop themselves using the temperature difference between your hot water tank and your garden pond and, what’s more, the harder they work, the more efficient they become. \r\n\r\nThomas Smith studied physics at Imperial College before taking on his PhD in the Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge. In June he received the 2004 Science Graduate of the Year Award for his research in thermofluidics.

This seminar is the fourth in a series that focuses on   themes  drawn from their past discussions and, on this occasion,  drawn from observations by participants at the Nightwalking   conference of September 2002.      \r\n\r\nThe words 'work', 'working', 'play' and 'playing' have featured on  numerous occasions and have been used to denote various    aspects of artistic processes. In addition, it has been noted that   for some, the notion of the artist 'playing' presented difficulties to   the perception of artmaking as a serious endeavour and to the  status of the artist themselves.     \r\n\r\nFor this seminar there will be no invited guest as the intention is to  allow for fuller debate with those who attend. This is in   response  to feedback from participants at previous seminars, so please  come ready to engage in debate.     \r\n\r\nTogether the ResCen artists represent decades of knowledge,  skills, craft and experience and the themes of working and playing   represent key strands in their account of the making of their work.       \r\n\r\nTo Reserve A Place:  \r\nEntrance to the seminar is free but to reserve a place contact  Natalie Daniel.                    \r\n\r\nEmail: rescen@mdx.ac.uk                     \r\nTelephone: 020 8411 6288/2710     \r\nOur most recent seminars are available to view on the ResCen  website:   \r\n\r\nwww.rescen.net        \r\n\r\n******************************************************************************      \r\nSTOP PRESS...Advance Notice of ResCen  External Seminar     \r\n\r\nDate:     \r\nEvening of Tuesday 25 May 2004     \r\n\r\nVenue:     \r\nCLORE, Royal Opera House, Covent Garden     \r\n\r\nTheme:  tbc     \r\nFurther details available soon and on our website:     www.rescen.net     \r\nReservations may be made through ResCen from      \r\nw/c 3 May 2004     \r\n\r\n*If you do not wish to receive e-mails from this address, please  contact ResCen (see above) and ask to be removed from the  mailing list.* \r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": null, "added": "2004-04-02T09:01:04", "slug": "the-artist-workingplaying", "speakers": [{"id": 264, "name": "ResCen Associate Artists", "slug": "rescen-associate-artists"}], "topics": [{"id": 145, "name": "performingarts", "path": "/arts/performingarts"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 128, "name": "The Theatre Museum", "slug": "the-theatre-museum", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC2E 7PR"}, "organizer": {"id": 104, "name": "ResCen", "slug": "rescen"}, "date": "2004-04-20", "dates": [{"id": 204, "from_date": "2004-04-20", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "18:15:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": null, "additional_info": null, "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 128, "name": "The Theatre Museum", "slug": "the-theatre-museum", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC2E 7PR"}, "organizer": {"id": 104, "name": "ResCen", "slug": "rescen"}}]}]
