Although Segal is interested in politics, she always shows us the realpolitik of intimate human relationships, too ... rich and evocative.' LA Jewish Journal\r\n\r\n“These are stories of encounters, chance meetings and epiphanies in streets that are at once exotic and familiar … shining a spotlight on our perceptions as non-Cubans of the so-called exotic other.” Ian McMillan, The Verb, BBC Radio 3\r\n“Each story is like a tiny painting, giving a glimpse into the often hidden and misunderstood lives led by the Cubans.” Random Things Through My Letterbox\r\n\r\n“[Segal] expresses the complex and conflicting emotions which bind together and splinter apart foreigners and Cubans ... [she] writes about Cuba with a unique style and voice.” Brixton Bugle\r\n\r\n“Breathe encapsulates the dynamics of some of my own experiences of living in Cuba and in frequent interaction with foreigners. [Segal’s] poetic writing eloquently portrays – and stripped of stereotypes – the complexities of the curiosity, power struggles, fears, presumptions, eroticism and cultural clash inherent in such interactions.” Ahmed Dickinson Cardenas, multi-award-winning Cuban guitarist\r\n\r\n“A look at Cuba through foreign eyes. Relying more on subtleties than on drama, [Segal] portrays the tensions and struggles, but also the joy and warmth, that fill Cubans' lives.” Aida Bahr, author of Ofelias, and winner of Cuba's Premio de la Critica Literaria\r\n\r\nLeila Segal was born in London, of Polish, Lithuanian and Romanian descent. She trained as a barrister before working in journalism for several years. In 2000 Leila visited Cuba; as soon as she arrived she knew that she wanted to stay. She lived first in Havana, then in the rural far West with her partner and his family. Breathe is her debut collection, for which she received funding from the Arts Council England. Leila founded and directs Voice of Freedom, an organisation that works with trafficked women.

Her experiences working as a doctor in villages around Egypt, witnessing prostitution, honour killings and sexual abuse, including female circumcision, drove her to give voice to this suffering. \r\n\r\nShe goes on to explore the causes of the situation through a discussion of the historical role of Arab women in religion and literature.

Our reigning national story is that a new era of rainbow acceptance is at hand. But dig a bit deeper, and this seemingly brave new gay world is disappointing. For all of the undeniable changes, the plea for tolerance has sabotaged the full integration of gays into American life. Same-sex marriage is unrecognized and unpopular in the vast majority of states, hate crimes proliferate, and even in the much vaunted ‘gay friendly’ world of Hollywood and celebrity culture, precious few stars are openly gay.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn ‘The Tolerance Trap’, Suzanna Walters takes on received wisdom about gay identities and gay rights, arguing that we are not ‘almost there’, but on the contrary have settled for a watered-down goal of tolerance and acceptance rather than a robust claim to full civil rights. After all, we tolerate unpleasant realities: medicine with strong side effects, a long commute, an annoying relative. Drawing on a vast array of sources and sharing her own personal journey, Walters shows how the low bar of tolerance demeans rather than ennobles both gays and straights alike. Her fascinating examination covers the gains in political inclusion and the persistence of anti-gay laws, the easy-out sexual freedom of queer youth and the suicides and murders of those in decidedly intolerant environments. \r\n\r\n She challenges both ‘born that way’ storylines that root civil rights in biology, and ‘god made me that way’ arguments that similarly situate sexuality as innate and impervious to decisions we make to shape it. A sharp and provocative cultural critique, this book deftly argues that a too-soon declaration of victory short-circuits full equality and deprives us all of the transformative possibilities of full integration. Tolerance is not the end goal, but a dead end. In ‘The Tolerance Trap’, Walters presents a complicated snapshot of a world-shifting moment in American history—one that is both a wake-up call and a call to arms for anyone seeking true equality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the author\r\n\r\nSuzanna Danuta Walters has written and lectured extensively on sexuality, popular culture, and feminism and is currently the Director of Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies and Professor of Sociology at Northeastern University. \r\n\r\n She is the author of several books, including ‘All the Rage: The Story of Gay Visibility in America’ and ‘Material Girls: Making Sense of Feminist Cultural Theory’.", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 2217, "added": "2015-04-07T18:06:34", "slug": "966018816101cad6", "speakers": [{"id": 15488, "name": "Suzanna  Danuta Walters", "slug": "suzanna-danuta-walters"}], "topics": [{"id": 1960, "name": "gayrights", "path": "/politics/activism/gayrights"}], "supercategory": "politics", "venue": {"id": 2783, "name": "Housmans Bookshop", "slug": "housmans-bookshop", "city": "London", "postcode": "N1 9DX"}, "organizer": {"id": 2783, "name": "Housmans Bookshop", "slug": "housmans-bookshop"}, "date": "2015-04-30", "dates": [{"id": 15139, "from_date": "2015-04-30", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "19:00:00", "ticket_cost": "Free entry", "ticket_info": null, "additional_info": "HOW TO FIND US:\r\nWe're very easy to find - just a two minute walk from King's Cross/St.Pancras terminals.

The successful development of effective technologies to treat HIV and vaccinate against polio, lymphatic filariasis and schistosomiasis have all rightfully been hailed as major steps forward in the struggle to control public health problems in sub-Saharan Africa. Lack of uptake of any of these innovations can, however, derail even the best-designed public health programmes. One of the factors contributing to poor uptake is patients’ distrust of either the health technologies themselves or the people who administer them. This is sometimes articulated in the form of conspiracy theories about the origins of the HIV, or the efficacy of vaccines, and constitutes a significant barrier to vaccine uptake, mass treatment compliance, HIV testing, and condom use in numerous countries. Drawing from in-depth research, the speakers will explore the causes and impacts of conspiracy beliefs and distrust of health interventions, and discuss possible solutions. \r\n\r\nTim Allen is professor in development anthropology at LSE. \r\n\r\nLaura Bogart is associate professor at Harvard Medical School. \r\n\r\nHeidi Larson is senior lecturer at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. \r\n\r\nNicoli Nattrass is professor of economics at the University of Cape Town. \r\n\r\nMelissa Parker is senior lecturer at Brunel University\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 732, "added": "2012-09-22T12:06:44", "slug": "41f24871991503a3", "speakers": [{"id": 1730, "name": "Professor  Tim Allen", "slug": "professor-tim-allen"}, {"id": 12894, "name": "Dr  Laura  Bogart", "slug": "dr-laura-bogart"}, {"id": 12895, "name": "Dr  Heidi  Larson", "slug": "dr-heidi-larson"}, {"id": 12896, "name": "Professor  Nicoli  Nattrass", "slug": "professor-nicoli-nattrass"}, {"id": 12897, "name": "Dr  Melissa  Parker", "slug": "dr-melissa-parker"}, {"id": 12898, "name": "Linsey  McGoey ", "slug": "linsey-mcgoey"}], "topics": [{"id": 3105, "name": "africa", "path": "/business/economy/growth/southasia/africa"}, {"id": 2947, "name": "economics", "path": "/politics/environment/environment/economics"}], "supercategory": "business", "venue": {"id": 2133, "name": "Hong Kong Theatre", "slug": "hong-kong-theatre", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC2A 2AE"}, "organizer": {"id": 1287, "name": "London School of Economics & Political Science", "slug": "london-school-of-economics-political-science"}, "date": "2012-11-13", "dates": [{"id": 12030, "from_date": "2012-11-13", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "18:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": "This event is free and open to all with no ticket required.

London currently relies heavily on landfill in the surrounding Counties.  The EU Landfill Directive and the need to manage waste sustainably mean that a step change is needed in how and where London deals with its waste.  London's existing waste management arrangements are complex and fragmented adding to the delivery challenge.  The speakers will address the policy response to these challenges which is set out in the Mayor's Municipal Waste Management Strategy and his spatial planning strategy the London Plan.  The lecture will specifically address the Mayor's preference for increasing recycling and delivering new technologies to manage London's waste as well as the recent review of London's waste governance arrangements and the likely impacts of that review.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 120, "image_id": null, "added": "2006-12-01T00:58:45", "slug": "2daf2d46f222d50e", "speakers": [{"id": 4773, "name": "Peter Daw", "slug": "peter-daw"}, {"id": 4774, "name": "Wayne Hubbard", "slug": "wayne-hubbard"}], "topics": [{"id": 1001, "name": "sustainability", "path": "/science/biology/sustainability/sustainability"}, {"id": 868, "name": "climate", "path": "/science/climatechange/climate"}, {"id": 158, "name": "sustainability", "path": "/science/biology/sustainability"}, {"id": 752, "name": "conservation", "path": "/science/naturalhistory/conservation"}], "supercategory": "science", "venue": {"id": 1212, "name": "Birkbeck, University of London", "slug": "birkbeck-university-of-london", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC1H 0PD"}, "organizer": {"id": 1069, "name": "Ecology and Conservation Studies Society", "slug": "ecology-and-conservation-studies-society"}, "date": "2007-03-09", "dates": [{"id": 3936, "from_date": "2007-03-09", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "18:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": null, "additional_info": "For any queries, please contact e-mail:   wright@britishlibrary.net;  tel:  020 7485 7903,\r\n   or contact e-mail:   h.atkinson@bbk.ac.uk ;  tel:  020 7679 1069", "members_only": "No", "members_info": "Details of the Society and application forms will be available at the door, and are on our website http://www.bbk.ac.uk/ce/environment/   [follow the link]", "venue": {"id": 1212, "name": "Birkbeck, University of London", "slug": "birkbeck-university-of-london", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC1H 0PD"}, "organizer": {"id": 1069, "name": "Ecology and Conservation Studies Society", "slug": "ecology-and-conservation-studies-society"}}]}, {"id": 3289, "title": "Tomorrows Textiles", "synopsis": "How might technology-embedded intelligent textiles impact our lifestyle in an increasingly security-obsessed yet stylish society?

He recently gave up a career as a university lecturer \"in order to have more time to think\", but fortunately came back to academia in his current post as Visiting Professor at Roehampton University and the Royal College of Art. He is a also member of the British Humanist Association. \r\n\r\nBorn in Bradford, Jonathan Rée was educated at Oxford, where he reacted against the kind of philosophy he was taught. \r\n\r\nHis interests and writings range from continental philosophy to African philosophy and from literature to science, and he spends much time working at various ways of reconnecting philosophical debate with historical inquiry, and seeking new audiences for it. \r\n\r\nHis writing is prolific and he is the author of more than a dozen books. His journalism appears in a multitude of publications, including the Times Literary Supplement, London Review of Books, the Independent, Prospect, Radical Philosophy and the New Humanist.\r\n\r\nHe also has wide experience as a broadcaster, \r\nboth on radio and television - appearing frequently on programmes such as 'Journeys In Thought' and 'In Our Time'.\r\n\r\nHe defines philosophy as \"a battle against the tyranny of the obvious...from the moment we are born we absorb masses of words, conventions, habits and notions from our surroundings. Before long they become second nature, the unconsidered framework of our whole approach to life and the world\".\r\n\r\nHe says philosophy is \"insisting on asking awkward questions about the self-serving common sense that surrounds us\" and \"refusing to go along with the smudges and fudges that most of us resort to, most of the time, to try to cover up the gaps and inconsistencies in our everyday thinking\"\r\n\r\nOne of his main aims is to lift the public out of the view that philosophers are oddballs, misfits and cranks, and bring philosophy to our level - saying \"A book of “Lives of the Great Philosophers” would be like a gallery of fusspots and freaks, maniacs and misfits. It might give pleasure to the kind of readers who enjoy smirking at the weakness, inconstancy or triviality of those they are expected to admire; but it would be no use to inquirers hoping to get some excitement, illumination and joy out of the works of the great philosophers...\"\r\n\r\nAbstract: 'Seeing the Unseen: Invisibility and the Visual Arts' - \"The invisible should perhaps be regarded as a dimension of the visible rather than a negation of it: to see something involves being aware that it has aspects that you cannot see. And perhaps this tells us something about how works of art - works of 'visual' art - work\".

The series will complement the forthcoming Future Face exhibition at the Science Museum in association with the Wellcome Trust running from 1 October 2004 - February 2005.   \r\n\r\nDelving into the social, ethical, moral and political implications of this groundbreaking field the events - running from Tuesday 5 October to Tuesday 2 December 2004 - offer the public a chance to discuss how faces and identity intertwine as well as probing common reactions to different types of faces. \r\n\r\nThe Dana Centre series of events will question the future of the human face: will we eventually be served in shops and restaurants by virtual faces as lifelike and responsive as our own? Will we one day unravel the genetic control of facial features and use this knowledge to create the ‘ideal’ child?  And will the safe passage from one country to another soon be guaranteed by a computer chip containing biological data?
