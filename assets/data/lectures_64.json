[{"id": 16230, "title": "The Gods of the Platonic Tradition 1", "synopsis": "The first of three evenings exploring the nature of the Gods as understood by the Platonists of the ancient world.", "keywords": "philosophy, plato, platonism,religion, polytheism", "body": "The Platonic tradition (which properly speaking should be seen as predating Plato himself) is an identifiable set of general ideas and practices which were handed on from one generation to the next for well over a thousand years, and which only ceased as the primary western philosophic teaching when the Christian Church established itself in a position of enforceable dominance in the late Roman Empire. The tradition was rooted in a pagan veneration of polytheistic Gods, while at the same time it recognized a singular First Principle – a transcending First God. How are we to understand this theological framework, so strange to the modern mind? Is a recognition of the Gods an optional extra in Platonic philosophy – an element we can eliminate without damage to its metaphysical and ethical structures? In what way do the mythological tales of Gods and heroes both reveal and obscure the part played by the Gods in Platonic philosophy? Can we look behind the vivid and beautiful stories and find the truths which so inspired the sages of the ancient tradition?\r\n\r\nIn a series of three linked evenings we will look at number of passages from the writings of some of the finest thinkers of the tradition with a view to seeing again the world with their eyes – perhaps to the point at which we can say with them \"all things are full of the Gods.\" Each of the three evenings will begin with a short introduction to an aspect of the subject and then move on to the extracts to be read: we should have at least an hour to discuss the ideas arising from these passages. In this first evening we'll look at the metaphysical place of the Gods in Platonic philosophy.\r\n\r\nNo previous experience of formal philosophy is required.\r\n\r\nEntrance in free, but donations between £3-5 will be welcomed.\r\n\r\nA PDF download of the extract we will be reading is available on our website together with further details of this and other Prometheus Trust's activities: www.prometheustrust.co.uk (the PDF is on the \"London Monday Evenings\" page.)\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 2555, "added": "2018-08-02T10:11:24", "slug": "d42ce626ecd7c50f", "speakers": [{"id": 3573, "name": "  Tim Addey", "slug": "tim-addey"}], "topics": [{"id": 1821, "name": "religion", "path": "/academic/religion/religion/religion"}, {"id": 2129, "name": "religion", "path": "/arts/history/religion/religion"}, {"id": 1822, "name": "philosophy", "path": "/academic/religion/religion/philosophy"}, {"id": 2388, "name": "philosophy", "path": "/arts/literature/philosophy/philosophy"}], "supercategory": "academic", "venue": {"id": 3106, "name": "Cecil Sharp House", "slug": "cecil-sharp-house", "city": "London", "postcode": "NW1 7AY"}, "organizer": {"id": 2041, "name": "The Prometheus Trust", "slug": "the-prometheus-trust"}, "date": "2018-09-17", "dates": [{"id": 16790, "from_date": "2018-09-17", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "19:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Donation", "ticket_info": null, "additional_info": null, "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 3106, "name": "Cecil Sharp House", "slug": "cecil-sharp-house", "city": "London", "postcode": "NW1 7AY"}, "organizer": {"id": 2041, "name": "The Prometheus Trust", "slug": "the-prometheus-trust"}}]}, {"id": 16102, "title": "River Danube as a Holocaust Landscape: The Journey of the Kladovo Transport", "synopsis": "In our first PhD and a Cup of Tea 2018 Series, Vesna Lukic will explore the role of audio-visual media in Holocaust representation.", "keywords": "WWII, history, genocide, library, Museums, war, Wiener Library, archive, research, Holocaust, free event, free entry, PhD research, film screening, Danube, Holocaust representation, Jewish refugees", "body": "The film Two Emperors and a Queen (2015) by Vesna Lukic traces the journey of the 'Kladovo transport': a large group of about 1200 Jewish refugees from central Europe whose illegal attempt to flee Nazi persecution in 1939 via the river Danube, fatally ended in Serbia in 1941/42.

There is certainly a long tradition of the appearance of ghostly armies. So what sort of ghostly expressions of conflict might have been expected during and after the First World War?\r\n\r\nOwen Davies is a reader in Social History at the University of Hertfordshire. His main field of research is on the history of modern and contemporary witchcraft and magic.\r\n\r\nThe Walking Dead – Dr. Carolyne Larrington\r\n\r\nThe dead don't always stay peacefully in their graves. British folklore and chronicle relates from very early times instances of vampire-like and undead behaviour, spelling disaster for communities. Radical social upheaval – such as the Norman Conquest – spawns narratives about the undead; later chroniclers remark that there are so many tales of the undead it would be tedious to list them all.  Recent archaeological finds seem to confirm the survival of these beliefs right up to the end of the medieval period; time-honoured ways of preventing the dead from walking again offer the best explanation for the unusual post-mortem treatment of some bodies. Nor is it just the British Isles that suffer from the plague of the walking dead; Icelandic sagas have many such tales, and some useful tips about how to settle such revenants once and for all.\r\n\r\nCarolyne Larrington is a Tutorial Fellow in English Literature at St John's Oxford and the author of The Land of the Green Man, Winter is Coming: the Medieval World of Game of Thrones and An Introduction to Norse Myths.\r\n\r\nThe Appearance of Ghosts: shrouds, sheets or see-through? Dr. Susan Owens\r\nThe idea that the dead can return to haunt the living is deeply rooted in the British imagination, and ghosts are central to countless plays and paintings, stories and ballads, photographs and films. But why has the appearance and behaviour of ghosts in art and literature altered over time? When did they stop wearing shrouds and put on white sheets or become see-through? And what do these changes reveal about them – and us?\r\n\r\nDr. Susan Owens, former Curator of Paintings at the Victoria and Albert Museum, is the author of The Ghost: A Cultural History (Tate Publishing, 2017).\r\n\r\nI Shall Goe Unto a Hare - Isobel Gowdie, Covens, Shamans and Familiar spirits in Seventeenth Century Scotland – Dr. John Callow\r\n\r\nThe four confessions given by Isobel Gowdie to a Scottish court, in May 1662, are seminal witchcraft texts; bringing folk belief in the faerie, the world of familiar spirits, night flight and the coven to stark prominence. This talk shows how a marginal figure, in her own day, moved towards the cultural mainstream, through the works of modern composers, rock musicians and novelist, and was comprehensively recast in the process.\r\n\r\nJohn Callow is an author, screenwriter and historian, specialising in Seventeenth Century politics, witchcraft, and popular culture including Embracing the Darkness: A Cultural History of Witchcraft (IB Tarsus 2017).\r\n\r\n\r\nPhantom Black Dogs - Mark Norman\r\nMark Norman is the creator and host of the Folklore Podcast and author of Black Dog Folklore, Black Dog Folklore, a comprehensive study of the image of the Black Dog in folklore, with an extensive gazetteer of over 700 UK sightings and traditions. He holds the UKs largest archive of black dog material and in this talk, will introduce the symbolism of the Black Dog motif.\r\n\r\nHow to Clean a 3,000-Year-Old Hill Figure - Emily Cleaver\r\nEmily Cleaver recounts a recent ‘scouring’ of the Uffington White Horse, the traditional cleaning event that has kept the chalk figure from becoming overgrown since its construction in the Iron Age. Exploring the archeological evidence for the origins of the figure, plus local folklore from fertility rituals to furniture arrangement. \r\n\r\nEmily is a writer with an interest in folklore, local traditions and history.\r\n\r\nThe Goat God in Albion – Gurus\r\nGyrus explores the bonds between the British landscape and the Greek god of nature, Pan. The Victorian obsession with Pan forms a historical backdrop for strange present-day encounters in rural darkness, and synchronicities which unearth Pan's hidden presence in the famed landscape of Avebury.'\r\n\r\nGyrus is the publisher of Dreamflesh  and the author of North: The Rise &Fall of the Polar Cosmos\r\n\r\nTalk of the Devil\r\nHe builds bridges, he drains punchbowls, he hurls quoits, he preaches strange doctrine from his pulpit. There’s no getting away from the Devil in the English legendary landscape, but who is he really? From his Arse to his Elbow, the Devil of local lore is a strange compound of fiend and buffoon. Those sulphurous hoofprints do not lead to any orthodox theology.\r\n\r\nJeremy Harte is a researcher into folklore and archaeology, with a particular interest in sacred space and tales of encounters with the supernatural. He is the author of English Holy Wells: A sourcebook and Explore Fairy Traditions.\r\n\r\nIn the dead of the night, when all people were sleeping: Ghosts in folk songs – Professor Paul Cowdell\r\n\r\nTraditional songs are full of folklore about ghosts. They tell you why people become ghosts, what ghosts look like, what the living must do to allow the dead to rest in peace. Paul Cowdell, folklore expert on ghosts and a fine singer, will be talking about ghostlore in and around traditional songs, and singing some.

These Wednesday evening workshops will encourage you to think, read, discuss and relate to different topics around the links between thinking and language.\r\nYou will gain the confidence and skills required to apply critical, reflective and creative thinking in your daily life, studies and work.\r\nAll workshops will run from 6.30 - 8.30pm. \r\nProgramme of Workshops\r\n20 April - thinking about thinking\r\nStarting with extracts from texts about thinking (John Dewey: How we Think, John Stuart Mill: On Liberty, Immanuel Kant: What is Enlightenment?), we will engage in a discussion about definitions of ‘critical thinking’, leading on to a questioning of its value (or not) in our day-to-day lives, before moving on to using the library and online resources to flesh out our own lines of enquiry. The session will end with us sharing our research and exploring if and how what we think about thinking shapes how we think.\r\n27 April - the language of power\r\nIn the society we live in, where we are not controlled by force, how do those in power stay in power? In this workshop, we will split into three groups and, using texts as starting points for further inquiry, consider 1) notions of power (Jan Bloemmart: Notes on Power), 2) advice on keeping those under your power on your side (Niccolo Machiavelli: The Prince), and 3) the idea that there is a link between the language we use and the thoughts we are able to think (George Orwell: The Principles of Newspeak). We will then reconvene to share our thoughts and findings, explore how the concepts connect with each other, and discuss real-life examples from our own experiences which relate to the central theme of Language and Power.\r\n4 May - the power of language\r\nLanguage is a tool for communicating ideas, thoughts and experiences - and the words we use have the potential to shape how things/events are understood. Starting with this idea of language as a means of persuasion, we will define the basic elements of communication and consider the use/value of rhetoric (Aristotle: Rhetoric), and explore the role identity plays in communication (Zimmerman’s three kinds of identity). The session will finish with us sharing examples of communication we have experienced which used rhetoric, and appeals to identity, to get the message across.\r\n11 May - memory and the language of persuasion\r\nThis workshop is about memory, described by Cicero as a ‘treasure-house of all things’, with memories compared to ‘the books in a library on shelves with different labels’ (Kant). After researching and discussing models of memory, we will analyse examples of rhetorical devices used in advertising, in order to critique the idea that carefully-constructed messages can bypass the usual, conscious, process of memory storage and embed themselves directly into long-term memory (Vance Packard: The Hidden Persuaders). We will finish by sharing our experiences of ‘memorable’ communication, and consider the ethics of using rhetorical devices.\r\n18 May - thinking through association\r\nAmerican psychologist Stanley Milgram’s Six Degrees of Separation illustrates the interconnectedness of people and society in the ‘small world’ we inhabit – claiming we are all connected through a chain of associations. In this workshop, after a brief introduction to semiotics (the study of signs and their meanings) we will explore trains of thought and consider how, in our minds, things link together, and share examples of how we associate things with other things, experiences or ideas. We will finish by discussing the value of harnessing this ‘thinking through association’.\r\n25 May - on reflection\r\nRounding off the series, this session is all about reflecting on what has happened in the workshops, how we feel and have felt about this (and how we have felt/feel about our feelings), and if/how what we have thought, shared and explored will impact on our thinking from here on in. We will explore different models of reflection and discuss any ‘critical incidents’ (Brookfield) we encountered along the way. We will use Ketso® - a ‘toolkit for creative engagement’ – to share our thoughts, reflections and feelings with each other, allowing us to discuss common themes and explore things further.\r\nWorkshop Facilitator\r\nAdam Ramejkis works as an Academic Support Tutor at University of the Arts London, where he supports students with their understanding of academic communication.

So the stakes could not be higher of professionals working to prevent abuse, but also false allegations of abuse.

It explores the interrelationship between mind-body and environment. The book examines how relations with others and social influences effect bodily experience even at the biological level, how unconscious communication is expressed in bodily ways and can be considered a form of language. In the book I relate the exploration of the body to an understanding of how people express emotional pain and difficulties in bodily states and symptoms. How does this multifaceted model of the body yield insight into dance as a profound form of affective communication.  \r\n\r\nFor further information, click here - http://www.independentdance.co.uk/programmepage/exchanges/crossing-borders/\r\n\r\nTickets:\r\nSingle talk £6 | £4 freelance and concession\r\n3-talk cards £16.50 | £10.50 freelance and concession\r\n\r\nDrinks Offer: Free drinks voucher for the first 20 people who book for any talk\r\n \r\nTo book, please call 020 7091 9650 or email info@independentdance.co.uk\r\n\r\nVenue:\r\nIndependent Dance\r\nSiobhan Davies Studios \r\n85 St. Georges Road\r\nLondon\r\nSE1 6ER\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 1768, "added": "2014-10-30T12:29:36", "slug": "0c188991ca326716", "speakers": [{"id": 15199, "name": "Nicola Diamond", "slug": "nicola-diamond"}], "topics": [{"id": 2676, "name": "dance", "path": "/arts/arts/education/dance"}, {"id": 1869, "name": "performance", "path": "/arts/film/videoart/performance"}, {"id": 3399, "name": "performance", "path": "/arts/art/contemporaryart/performance"}, {"id": 1018, "name": "talk", "path": "/arts/education/debate/talk"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 1781, "name": "Independent Dance", "slug": "independent-dance", "city": "London", "postcode": "SE1 6ER"}, "organizer": {"id": 1781, "name": "Independent Dance", "slug": "independent-dance"}, "date": "2014-11-04", "dates": [{"id": 14701, "from_date": "2014-11-04", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "19:00:00", "ticket_cost": "£4-£6", "ticket_info": "Please call Siobhan Davies reception on 020 7091 9650 or email info@independentdance.co.uk.", "additional_info": null, "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 1781, "name": "Independent Dance", "slug": "independent-dance", "city": "London", "postcode": "SE1 6ER"}, "organizer": {"id": 1781, "name": "Independent Dance", "slug": "independent-dance"}}]}, {"id": 14030, "title": "Thinking on Sunday - 'Nothing to be frightened of'", "synopsis": "Chris Bratcher and Manu Bazzano talk about death", "keywords": "FGM, circumcision, science, atheism, atheist, humanism, religion,", "body": "A sampling of novelist Julian Barnes' touching and very personal memoir of his experiences of death in the family, and the demise of the famous and obscure in literature and life, plus his own fears and ruminations on his own, entitled 'Nothing to be Frightened of', published in 2008 (available in paperback).    \r\nI will give a brief introduction to the book and some snippets from it, with comments to set the ball rolling.  For example, the book begins with what he claims to be his standard response to questions about what he believes: “I don’t believe in God, but I miss Him”; a statement (actually about the cultural and artistic legacy of others’ belief) which Barnes’ philosopher brother considers “soppy”.  Do you agree?\r\nIt would nice if attendees were familiar with the book, so that they could give their own take on it and recount bits they liked or otherwise.\r\nChris Bratcher is a former Chair and Treasurer of Conway Hall Ethical Society, and practised Sunday session talks giver and lecturer on a wide range of topics born of his academic philosophical discipline of Ethics and the Philosophy of Mind, and from his studies in Literature and Fine Arts. \r\nManu Bazzano\r\nI will discuss this subject from a Zen perspective. Living-and-dying is one word in Zen (shoji), a river running towards the sea, a river that cannot go back to the source. Our suffering is often caused by wanting to stand by the riverbank. The task of the psychotherapist is often thankless: urging the client back to the river of life thus renewing the promise of death. Even more thankless is the task of the philosopher: remembering the initial commitment to remain attentive of the delicate labour of death.

Yet it is the implications and ramifications of Darwin’s momentous discovery that have continued to reverberate through the passage of time. \r\n\r\nThe evident truth and fact of evolution inspired gifted 20th century visionaries, such as Teilhard de Chardin and Sri Aurobindo, as well as many others before and since, to add their own interpretation and insights to this discovery. And they observed, inferred and experienced  that there was far more to the picture than simply natural and biological evolution. Entering into the interior dimensions of evolution, they began to map out the territory of consciousness itself. \r\n\r\nIt is precisely into this territory that the innovative writer and educationalist David Lorimer and Chris Parish, a dedicated explorer of consciousness, will take us, uncovering wisdom, profound truths and new perspectives on the implications of the evolution of consciousness. And hopefully you will get a sense of how valuable and meaningful this is for the lives we lead. \r\n\r\nDavid Lorimer has had a long-term fascination with this kind of enquiry and has published several books, such as 'Thinking Beyond the Brain and 'Science, Consciousness and Ultimate Reality'. He is also a director of the Scientific and Medical Network as well as the Wrekin Tust. \r\n\r\nChris Parish has devoted much of his life to this investigation.

The purpose of this experiment was to send signals back and forth between Professor Warwick’s nervous system and a computer via the internet, and most notably, to communicate with his wife Irena who also had an array implanted in her arm. This was noted as the first direct electronic communication between the nervous systems of two humans. In May 2011, ‘Milo’, a Serbian living in Austria, volunteered to have his hand amputated so he could be fitted with a bionic limb connecting to and controlled by the nerve signals in his arm, which had been paralysed in a motorcycle accident, and already partly repaired using nerves from his leg. Meanwhile, developments in stem cell science and synthetic biology have brought the prospect of replacing flesh with ‘synthetic’ flesh a whole lot closer, raising further questions about where man ends and machine begins.\r\n\r\nRobots, the 2005 computer-animated comedy film, reflects a real intellectual tension between a relatively fixed, physiologically-based conception of humanity and the increasingly sophisticated world of computer-based devices with human characteristics. It seems we are blurring the distinction between the human form we were born with and the modified form increasing numbers of us now have through medical intervention, as well as sophisticated technologies that interface with our physiology.\r\n\r\nTo what extent are we becoming or could become ‘transhumans’? And to what extent can human-designed devices become more human, and even think like or better than humans – beating the ‘Turing test’, long thought to distinguish humans from computers?

The following arenas of psychogeographical work will be reviewed including what the Situationists wrote about and what drifts they conducted, as well as writings and practices by various psychogeographical groups in the UK and internationally and academic writings from critical psychology, geography and feminism. It is argued that the psychogeographical practice of the dérive (drift) can be used as a political intervention to reflect on how we think about social environments and to begin to envision what future non-capitalist places could look like. It is also argued that the dynamics of a psychogeographical group can be used as a way to experiment with what non-capitalist, hierarchical groups could look like, in line with what the Situationists, as well as other radical, anarchic groups conceptualised in terms of self-managed, non-leadership led societies. A consideration of what makes walking a political intervention and how academic methods can be political is also considered in terms of thinking about how academic/intellectual ideas can change society and what needs to change in society.  \r\n\r\nWALK: Walking with dice \r\nFollowing the talk, a psychogeographical walk will take place, where it will be explained how anti-navigational devices such as dice will be used to disorientate ourselves in Leeds city.

Many alternatives to this “culture areas” approach over the past decades have derived from a re-thinking of world systems theory, developed originally by Wallerstein in 1974. The advantage of this method is that it also takes into account differences, as well as the negotiations between differences and identities that occur in the intercultural relations on the frontiers between groups, whether through trade, conquest, language contact or simply ongoing socio-cultural relations.

Because we are currently in the middle of this transition, it is unclear now how the next generation of medicine and surgery will appear, although trends in the technologies are toward low-power, miniaturized, low-cost yet highly \"intelligent\" systems that eventually will transform surgery from minimally invasive into noninvasive procedures whose development will depend on the emerging Information Age technologies. Laparoscopic (or minimal access) surgery is not an end-point; rather, it is a transitional phase between the radical approach of \"open\" surgery and the emerging forms of noninvasive image-guided procedures (Interventional MR). \r\n\r\nNow is the time that all of these separate elements that the unit is currently active involved in such as laparoscopic surgery, telepresence, virtual reality, digital imaging, and networking are coming together.

These birds cut out probes from leaves (seemingly according to a ‘mental template’), and also shape the ends of twigs into hooks. Alex will describe his attempts to discover whether these crows ‘understand’ what they are doing – is it just habit or does it involve intelligence?

Without evil goodness could not arise. The intuition guiding this inquiry is that being good is largely a matter of combating evil. Evil, not merely its possibility, one could say, is the excuse for being good. And the amount and variety of expressions of goodness is roughly proportional to the amount and variety of experiences of evil.     \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe notion of agent-caused evil is not the traditional dualistic notion where evil is understood as an independent demonic force from without. Rather, the idea is that the roots of evil are shared with the roots of goodness. We are good because we are capable of evil. Moreover, in order to be good one must struggle against temptation, against the ever-present risk of the sorts of psychological distortions responsible for the advent of evil; psychological distortions caused by actual evils, moral and otherwise.
