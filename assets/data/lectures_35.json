", "keywords": "books, politics", "body": "Housmans are delighted to welcome JJ Amaworo Wilson, author of Damnificados in conversation with activists from UCL Cut the Rent and Goldsmiths Cut the Rent campaigns for a conversation on housing activism and struggles in London. \r\n\r\nWilson’s novel Damnificados is loosely based on the real-life occupation of a half-completed skyscraper in Caracas, Venezuela, the Tower of David. In this fictional version, six hundred “damnificados”—vagabonds and misfits—take over an abandoned urban tower and set up a community complete with schools, stores, beauty salons, bakeries, and a rag-tag defensive militia. Their always heroic (and often hilarious) struggle for survival and dignity pits them against corrupt police, the brutal military, and the tyrannical “owners.”\r\n\r\nThis event is part of Housmans London’s Burning season.\r\n\r\nReviews\r\n\r\n“Should be read by every politician and rich bastard and then force-fed to them—literally, page by page.”—Jimmy Santiago Baca, author of A Place to Stand\r\n\r\n“Two-headed beasts, biblical floods, dragonflies to the rescue—magical realism threads through this authentic and compelling struggle of men and women—the damnificados—to make a home for themselves against all odds. Into this modern, urban, politically familiar landscape of the ‘have-nots’ versus the ‘haves,’ Amaworo Wilson introduces archetypes of hope and redemption that are also deeply familiar—true love, vision quests, the hero’s journey, even the remote possibility of a happy ending. These characters, this place, this dream will stay with you long after you’ve put this book down.”—Sharman Apt Russell, author of Hunger\r\n\r\n“Only a rare and special talent can take contemporary realities—sad, joyful, infuriating, inspiring—and spin them into legend. In a narrative rich in danger, adventure, humor, romance, and risk, JJ Amaworo Wilson raises essential questions without succumbing to earnestness or didacticism.”—Diane Lefer, author of Confessions of a Carnivore\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the Participants\r\n\r\nJJ Amaworo Wilson is a German-born, British-educated debut novelist.

Very little is known for certain about him, and the only writing we have from him is a hexameter poem, On Nature, which survives in fragmentary form (only 160 lines from its original 3,000 have come down to us). What we can see is that Parmenides not only offers an early exposition of one of the great questions of philosophy – in what way does knowledge differ from belief? – but that his teachings arise from an initiatory tradition which has been more or less obscured by modern approaches to philosophy.\r\n  \r\nParmenides pervades the thousand year history of the ancient Platonic tradition, from Plato's depiction of a young Socrates learning from him (around 450 BCE) to Simplicius' careful preservation of most of our surviving Parmenidean fragments in his writings (around 550 CE).\r\n \r\nHis is \"the way of truth\" which departs from the ordinary \"way of appearances\": we will look at the enigmatic fragments which may, perhaps, start us on that journey as we consider how his timeless insights connect the ancient world with modern life.\r\n\r\nNo previous experience of formal philosophy is required.\r\n\r\nEntrance in free, but donations between £3-5 will be welcomed.\r\n\r\nA PDF download of the extract we will be reading is available on our website together with further details of this and other Prometheus Trust's activities: www.prometheustrust.co.uk (the PDF is on the \"London Monday Evenings\" page.)", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 2510, "added": "2016-04-15T10:25:31", "slug": "0b02f876eb284613", "speakers": [{"id": 16102, "name": "Tim  Addey", "slug": "tim-addey"}], "topics": [{"id": 3310, "name": "mythology", "path": "/religion/spirituality/spiritualdevelopment/mythology"}, {"id": 1822, "name": "philosophy", "path": "/academic/religion/religion/philosophy"}, {"id": 2388, "name": "philosophy", "path": "/arts/literature/philosophy/philosophy"}, {"id": 365, "name": "platonism", "path": "/arts/philosophy/platonism"}], "supercategory": "religion", "venue": {"id": 3106, "name": "Cecil Sharp House", "slug": "cecil-sharp-house", "city": "London", "postcode": "NW1 7AY"}, "organizer": {"id": 2041, "name": "The Prometheus Trust", "slug": "the-prometheus-trust"}, "date": "2016-06-27", "dates": [{"id": 15871, "from_date": "2016-06-27", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "19:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Donation", "ticket_info": null, "additional_info": "No need to pre-book.

They consider their Israeli identity as an established fact that does not require legitimation through the past.\r\n\r\nGunnar Lehmann is Professor of Archaeology working today in various projects in Israel and Turkey.\r\n\r\nAdmission is free but places are strictly limited and must be reserved in advance by contacting the Leo Baeck Institute, London (emailinfo@leobaeck.co.uk or phone 020 7882 5690).\r\n\r\nProgramm\r\nDates: European LBI Lecture Series\r\n\r\n5th November 2015, 6.30pm\r\n\r\nProf Gunnar Lehmann (Ben Gurion University of the Negev, Israel)\r\n'Past and Politics in the Archaeology of Israel'\r\n\r\n3rd December 2015, 6.30pm\r\n\r\nDr Thabet Abu Rass (Ben Gurion University of the Negev, Israel)\r\n'Land, Power and Resistance in Israel: The Case of the Bedouins of the Negev'\r\n\r\n11th February 2016, 6.30pm\r\n\r\nProf Yfaat Weiss (Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel)\r\n'Political Sovereignty and Cultural Property: The Mount Scopus Enclave in Jerusalem'\r\n\r\n14th April 2016, 6.30pm\r\n\r\nDr Wendy Pullan (University of Cambridge, UK)\r\n'In the Shadow of the Wall: Icon and Identity in Jerusalem's Separation Barrier'\r\n\r\nKontakt\r\nLeo Baeck Institute\r\n2nd Floor, Arts Two Building\r\nQueen Mary, University of London\r\nMile End Road\r\nLondon E1 4NS\r\ninfo@leobaeck.co.uk\r\nTel. +44 (0) 20 7882 5690\r\nFax +44 (0) 20 7882 6901\r\nhttp://www.leobaeck.co.uk", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": null, "added": "2015-10-23T13:04:21", "slug": "european-leo-baeck-institute-lecture-series-201516-the-politics-of-land-archaeology-architectur", "speakers": [], "topics": [], "supercategory": "academic", "venue": {"id": 2471, "name": "German Historical Institute", "slug": "german-historical-institute", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC1A 2NJ"}, "organizer": {"id": 2155, "name": "Leo Baeck Institute London", "slug": "leo-baeck-institute-london"}, "date": "2015-11-05", "dates": [{"id": 15546, "from_date": "2015-11-05", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "18:30:00", "ticket_cost": "free", "ticket_info": "Admission is free, but places are limited and must be reserved in advance by contacting the Leo Baeck Institute (t: +44 (0)20 7882 5690 or info@leobaeck.co.uk).", "additional_info": "Underground: Holborn, Russell Square; Bus: 1, 7, 8, 19, 25, 38, 55, 59, 68, 91, 98, 134, 168, 171, 188, 242, 243, 521, X68", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 2471, "name": "German Historical Institute", "slug": "german-historical-institute", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC1A 2NJ"}, "organizer": {"id": 2155, "name": "Leo Baeck Institute London", "slug": "leo-baeck-institute-london"}}]}, {"id": 14973, "title": "Can writers and artists ever be terrorists?", "synopsis": "Anti-terror legislation has been used in several countries to effectively gag free speech about sensitive political issues.", "keywords": "Writers, artists, terrorists", "body": "Anti-terror legislation has been used in several countries to effectively gag free speech about sensitive political issues, but can writing or painting be a terrorist act and what role do they play in radicalisation?", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 2401, "added": "2015-10-08T20:43:11", "slug": "941318f4e8379c47", "speakers": [{"id": 15763, "name": "Anthony Glees", "slug": "anthony-glees"}, {"id": 15764, "name": "Sara Silvestri", "slug": "sara-silvestri"}], "topics": [{"id": 848, "name": "writers", "path": "/arts/books/biography/writers"}, {"id": 2690, "name": "writers", "path": "/arts/literature/21stcentury/writers"}, {"id": 1026, "name": "artists", "path": "/religion/islam/women/artists"}, {"id": 2598, "name": "artists", "path": "/arts/artists/artists"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 1267, "name": "The Faculty of Law", "slug": "the-faculty-of-law", "city": "Cambridge", "postcode": "CB3 9DZ"}, "organizer": {"id": 3065, "name": "Cambridge Festival of Ideas", "slug": "cambridge-festival-of-ideas"}, "date": "2015-10-01", "dates": [{"id": 15497, "from_date": "2015-10-01", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "9:00:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": "http://cfi2015canwritersandartistseverbeterrorists.eventbrite.co.uk", "additional_info": null, "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 1267, "name": "The Faculty of Law", "slug": "the-faculty-of-law", "city": "Cambridge", "postcode": "CB3 9DZ"}, "organizer": {"id": 3065, "name": "Cambridge Festival of Ideas", "slug": "cambridge-festival-of-ideas"}}]}, {"id": 14938, "title": "The Unfortunate Colonel Despard", "synopsis": "The Unfortunate Colonel Despard: “Governor of Belize”, Anti-racist, Democrat, Executed as a Traitor 1803", "keywords": "slavery, slave trade, England, London, law, Britain, Despard, Ireland, traitor", "body": "Colonel Edward Despard was executed in London in 1803 as a terrorist and traitor.

To push this approach forward it has established an Expert Panel, charged with rewriting the curriculum inherited by New Labour. Its first report argues that the new school curriculum should ‘focus on clear and well-evidenced “maps” of the key elements of subjects’ and give ‘all pupils access to “powerful knowledge”’. The Expert Panel has recently published subject proposals for primary maths, science and English, which aim to ‘restore rigour’ and it suggests that by 11 pupils should be able to divide a fraction, use the subjunctive and discuss evolution. Simultaneously the coalition has introduced a new way of measuring school performance at secondary level – the English Baccalaureate – which rewards those schools in which students achieve A*-C grades in six traditional GCSEs (English, mathematics, history or geography, the sciences, and an ancient or modern foreign language are allowed).\r\n\r\nThese initiatives have prompted a mixed response from parents, teachers and academics. Some have suggested that they are prescriptive, nostalgic and elitist. The Coalition’s reforms, it has been argued, represent little more than a ‘curriculum of the dead’. One parent phoned into a BBC radio show featuring education secretary Michael Gove, claiming he was seething over the Baccalaureate idea, as ‘I don’t understand where you got your arbitrary list of subjects’. Children’s writer Michael Rosen wrote a highly sceptical blog in response to suggestions that all primary children from the age of five should be made to learn poetry by heart. And Expert Panel member Andrew Pollard has attacked his own group’s findings, suggesting that its approach to curriculum design was ‘fatally flawed’.\r\n\r\nOthers, however, have welcomed the return to subjects. They have suggested that for too long knowledge has been marginalised. They argue that a traditional subject-based curriculum liberates pupils by giving them access to powerful ideas. This maybe ‘culturally conservative’, they add, but it is radical in its social and political implications. So should the return to a subject-based education be applauded? Does it represent backward-looking nostalgia or an attempt to democratise access to powerful knowledge? Do those who wish to ‘bring knowledge back’ have the intellectual and social capital required to be successful or are we about to witness another passing edufad?\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 1751, "added": "2012-09-13T11:55:23", "slug": "817994fdf51e5580", "speakers": [{"id": 12754, "name": "Daisy  Christodoulou", "slug": "daisy-christodoulou"}, {"id": 11800, "name": "Martin Johnson", "slug": "martin-johnson"}, {"id": 10522, "name": "Tim  Oates", "slug": "tim-oates"}, {"id": 12755, "name": "Alka  Sehgal Cuthbert", "slug": "alka-sehgal-cuthbert"}, {"id": 5860, "name": "Toby Marshall", "slug": "toby-marshall"}], "topics": [{"id": 2692, "name": "history", "path": "/arts/finearts/film/film/history"}, {"id": 106, "name": "wwi", "path": "/arts/books/history/military/wwi"}, {"id": 107, "name": "wwii", "path": "/arts/books/history/military/wwii"}, {"id": 108, "name": "army", "path": "/arts/books/history/military/army"}, {"id": 6, "name": "arts", "path": "/arts"}, {"id": 2157, "name": "culturalhistoru", "path": "/arts/history/culturalhistoru"}, {"id": 614, "name": "worldhistory", "path": "/arts/history/worldhistory"}, {"id": 554, "name": "creativity", "path": "/arts/education/creativity"}, {"id": 943, "name": "debate", "path": "/arts/education/debate"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 1636, "name": "Hamilton House", "slug": "hamilton-house", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC1H 9BD"}, "organizer": {"id": 45, "name": "Institute of Ideas", "slug": "institute-of-ideas"}, "date": "2012-10-11", "dates": [{"id": 11881, "from_date": "2012-10-11", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "19:00:00", "ticket_cost": "£7.50 (£5.00)", "ticket_info": "http://www.instituteofideas.com/tickets/battlesatellites2012.html", "additional_info": "Visit www.battleofideas.org.uk for more information.", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 1636, "name": "Hamilton House", "slug": "hamilton-house", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC1H 9BD"}, "organizer": {"id": 45, "name": "Institute of Ideas", "slug": "institute-of-ideas"}}]}, {"id": 11390, "title": "From Timber to Treen – useful woods at Kew", "synopsis": "Kew’s Economic Botany Collection includes one of the world’s largest collections of timbers and wooden objects.

It has taken on the most powerful nation in the world and produced headlines around the globe. \r\n\r\nWikiLeaks has also provoked condemnation for its disregard for conventional journalistic ethics and its disruption of diplomacy.

A long-time champion of women's rights, she has advocated for gender equality and women's empowerment throughout her career. One of her major successes as President was her decision to save billions of dollars in revenues to spend on issues such as pension reform, social protection programmes for women and children, and research and development, despite the financial crisis. Other initiatives included tripling the number of free early child-care centres for low-income families and the completion of some 3,500 child-care centres around the country. \r\n\r\nMs Bachelet also held ministerial portfolios in the Chilean Government as Minister of Defence and Minister of Health. As Defence Minister, Ms Bachelet introduced gender policies intended to improve the conditions of women in the military and police forces.

She graduated summa cum laude from Barnard College, and immediately went on to graduate work at Princeton University, receiving her Ph.D. in philosophy.  After earning her Ph.D. she returned to her alma mater, where she taught courses in philosophy of science, philosophy of mind, philosophy of psychology, the rationalists, the empiricists, and the ancient Greeks.  It was some time during her tenure at Barnard that, quite to her own surprise, she used a summer vacation to write her first novel, The Mind-Body Problem.  \r\n\r\nMore novels followed: The Late-Summer Passion of a Woman of Mind; The Dark Sister, which received the Whiting Writer's Award, Mazel, which received the 1995 National Jewish Book Award and the 1995 Edward Lewis Wallant Award; and Properties of Light: A Novel of Love, Betrayal, and Quantum Physics. Her book of short stories, Strange Attractors, received a National Jewish Book Honor Award. Her 2005 book Incompleteness: The Proof and Paradox of Kurt Gödel, was featured in articles in The New Yorker and The New York Times, received numerous favorable reviews Goldstein's most recent published book is, Betraying Spinoza: The Renegade Jew who Gave Us Modernity, published in May 2006, and winner of the 2006 Koret International Jewish Book Award in Jewish Thought. Her new novel, Thirty-Six Arguments for the Existence of God: A Work of Fiction, will be published by Pantheon Books.\r\n\r\nIn 2005 she was elected to The American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 2006 she received a Guggenheim Fellowship and a Radcliffe Fellowship. In 2008, she was designated a Humanist Laureate by the International Academy of Humanism, and was awarded an Honorary Doctorate by Emerson College. Aside from Barnard, Goldstein has taught in the Columbia MFA writing program and in the department of philosophy at Rutgers, has been a visiting scholar at Brandeis University, and taught for five years as a Visiting Professor in the Department of Philosophy at Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut. In 2006-2007 she was a Fellow at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard University, and a Guggenheim Fellow. \r\n\r\nSteven Pinker is the Johnstone Family Professor in the Department of Psychology at Harvard University. Until 2003, he taught in the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences at MIT. He conducts research on language and cognition, writes for publications such as the New York Times, Time, and Slate, and is the author of seven books, including The Language Instinct, How the Mind Works, Words and Rules, The Blank Slate, and most recently, The Stuff of Thought: Language as a Window into Human Nature.\r\n\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 60, "image_id": 732, "added": "2010-01-27T10:35:52", "slug": "bb9b4e4ee02d0727", "speakers": [{"id": 9324, "name": "Rebecca  Newberger Goldstein", "slug": "rebecca-newberger-goldstein"}, {"id": 1355, "name": "Professor Steven Pinker", "slug": "professor-steven-pinker"}, {"id": 9325, "name": "Chair Dr Helena Cronin ", "slug": "chair-dr-helena-cronin"}], "topics": [{"id": 131, "name": "authors", "path": "/arts/literature/fiction/british/21stcentury/authors"}, {"id": 130, "name": "21stcentury", "path": "/arts/literature/fiction/british/21stcentury"}, {"id": 170, "name": "newtopic", "path": "/science/chemistry/biochemistry/catalysis/newtopic"}, {"id": 1891, "name": "literature", "path": "/arts/literature/19thcentury/literature"}, {"id": 95, "name": "interfaith", "path": "/religion/interfaith"}, {"id": 2000, "name": "god", "path": "/religion/culture/moralphilosophy/god"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 1287, "name": "London School of Economics & Political Science", "slug": "london-school-of-economics-political-science", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC2A 2AE"}, "organizer": {"id": 1287, "name": "London School of Economics & Political Science", "slug": "london-school-of-economics-political-science"}, "date": "2010-03-10", "dates": [{"id": 8082, "from_date": "2010-03-10", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "18:00:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": null, "additional_info": "This event is free and open to all with no ticket required.

A range of contending perspectives on public engagement emerge: (1) as an instrumental means to justify particular outcomes or secure greater public trust and acceptance; (2) as a normative matter of democratic legitimacy (alternatively seen as 'political correctness'); or (3) as a substantive challenge concerned with the validation and elaboration of the notion of 'sustainability' itself - and its implications for more 'precautionary' technology choices. In all these modes, strong contrasts are drawn with practices of 'science' and 'evidence based' assessment.\r\n \r\nThis talk will explore these tensions and draw attention to some of the underlying commonalities between the roles of both science and participation in policy making for sustainability. It will argue that there are some important but neglected practical characteristics of both scientific and participatory approaches to technology and policy appraisal, which cross-cut the usual divides between expert and citizen, quantitative and qualitative, analytic and deliberative. In short, both may be conducted such as alternatively to 'open up' or 'close down' the domain of conditionally-viable options in decision making. Rather than pursuing either 'expert analytic' or 'participatory-deliberative' approaches at the expense of the other, the paper will conclude that greater attention needs to be given in both areas to the aim of 'opening up' the essentially political nature of sustainability. It is only in this way that we can reconcile the essential and demanding imperatives both of scientific rigour and democratic accountability.\r\n\r\nAndy Stirling is Science Director of one of world’s leading research centres for science and technology policy research, SPRU.

In order to assess the extent to which such statements may provide evidence of the possibility of post-mortem survival, it is important to employ protocols that are effective in ruling out alternative explanations (such as chance, fraud or 'cold reading'). Recent academic research attempting to use such protocols has either been dogged by criticism for actually lacking them, or not provided evidence for mediumship ability. There is also an inherent difficulty in using 'special claimants' as, aside from other points raised in the talk, issues regarding anonymity and confidentiality arise as participants occasionally abuse their participation and declare it almost as a 'badge of credibility'. There are frequent references in the late 1800s and early 1900s to problems in sitting with mediums, problems that appear not to have gone away.\r\n The media provides an alternative setting where such protocols are not available and so assessment of their ability is even more difficult.

He is a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering and was awarded the Outstanding Achievement Medal for Informatics in 2000.\r\n\r\nProfessor Aleksander is internationally known for his pioneering work looking for keys to consciousness in intelligent machines, and has been at the forefront of the Artificial Intelligence community for over four decades. In the 1980s he was responsible for the design of the world's first neural pattern recognition system, WISARD. He currently heads a major British team applying engineering principles to the understanding of the human brain, and has built several pioneering machines, culminating in the MAGNUS neurocomputational system, which he calls \"a machine with imagination\".\r\n\r\nThe idea of conscious machines is controversial and supporters are often accused of sensationalism, arrogance, or philosophical ignorance. Part of the problem, says Aleksander, is that consciousness remains ill-defined. Since designing thinking machines requires not just the ability to write computer programs but also an understanding of what we mean by 'consciousness,' 'mind,' and 'intelligence,' Igor also inquires into the philosophy of meaning of these terms.\r\n\r\nProfessor Aleksander has appeared extensively on TV and radio and his publications are far-reaching and seemingly boundless, having published over 200 papers and 12 books.\r\n\r\nHe has been described as \"a plain-speaking and clear-sighted engineer\", \"extremely articulative and entertaining to work with\", his lectures \"an adventure and an inspiration for the human, if not yet the robotic, mind\". When praised for his pioneering work he replies, \"I wouldn't say pioneer, I would say maverick. I never went along with the mainstream.\"\r\n\r\nHe enjoys Jazz and Classical music, used to play the drums, likes cooking and not doing very much in Greek and French villages.\r\n\r\nThis lecture will be of interest to everyone, from engineers and computer scientists to science fiction and psychology buffs. It promises to satisfy the curiosity every one of us has about our own consciousness.

We can help to reduce these emissions by a third, just by tackling energy efficiency in the home. But how exactly do we do that? \r\n\r\nSome of these things are common sense, like always building south facing conservatories and adding lots of insulation to your home and that’s where the importance of government regulation comes in – persuading everyone to adopt these basic approaches. \r\n\r\nBut it is also possible to incorporate seemingly complex devices, such as solar tiles and wind veins, into your homes, and some politicians are advocating that these things sound be included as standard in all new building.

It aims to inspire, educate and involve visitors. It achieves this by building, researching and caring for the national collections; and by interpreting these collections and engaging the public in the contemporary issues they raise.\r\n# The BA is the UK's nationwide, open membership organisation dedicated to connecting science with people, so that science and its applications become accessible to all. The BA aims to promote openness about science in society and to engage and inspire people directly with science and technology and their implications.\r\n# The goal of EDAB is to inform the general public and decision makers about the importance of brain research. EDAB aims to advance knowledge about the personal and public benefits of neuroscience and to disseminate information on the brain, in health and disease, in an accessible and relevant way.\r\n", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 15, "name": "Dana Centre", "slug": "dana-centre", "city": "London", "postcode": "SW7 5HE"}, "organizer": {"id": 46, "name": "Science Museum", "slug": "science-museum"}}]}, {"id": 246, "title": "Orange Prize for Fiction Readings", "synopsis": "This is a unique opportunity to hear the shortlisted authors read and discuss their work with this year’s chair of judges, Sandi Toksvig.", "keywords": "literature", "body": "The Orange Prize for Fiction is one of the UK’s most prestigious literary awards for fiction, and was established in 1996.
