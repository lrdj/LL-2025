Militarizing space to secure land has always been one of the means to control land. The Prawer Plan is the current attempt of displacing the Bedouins to finalize their land claims and urbanize them against their will. The landowners have tried all means of resistance including the legal and political ones, however, they didn't succeed. Therefore, they returned to their tribal roots in a last, but incredibly effective attempt to challenge the imminent confiscation of the lands of their ancestors. \r\nAbu Rass is a political geographer and an expert in land and planning.

The year is 1613: the Ottoman Empire is at its height, sprawling from Hungary to Iraq, Morocco to Yemen. One man dares to challenge it: the Prince of a curious Druze sect in Mount Lebanon, Fakhr ad-Din. Yielding before a mighty army sent to conquer him, he—astonishingly—takes refuge with the Medici in Florence at the height of the Renaissance. Fakhr ad-Din took along with him a diverse party of Moslem, Christian, and Jewish Levantines on their first visit to the “Lands of the Christians.” During his five-year stay in Italy, he fights to persuade Popes, Grand-Dukes and Viceroys to support a grand plan: a new Crusade to wrest the Holy Land from the Ottomans, giving Jerusalem back to Christendom and himself a crown.\r\n\r\nThe evening will be introduced by Michel Moushabeck, founder of Interlink Publishing, followed by a reading from the book by its author Ted Gorton, interwoven with songs and instrumental pieces to accompany the Emir’s journey in the 17th century from the Levant to Tuscany and back.\r\n\r\nTed Gorton taught Arabic at St Andrews University and was an adjunct professor at Georgetown University.

Unique teachings on the soul, the esoteric dimensions of the cosmos and its primordial deities, form a powerful and complex system of Voudon; providing its adepts with the keys to attain magical powers, creative freedom and Gnostic liberation. Elaborating on these, and other central themes, the speaker takes us through some of the most hidden realms of Inner Voudon.\r\n\r\nDavid Beth is an internationally respected spiritual and esoteric teacher. Born to German parents in Angola, Africa he has been initiated into several lineages of Afro-centric Gnosis, as well as Western forms of Esotericism.

Attention is paid to the particular loa associated with these struggles and the colonial authority's responses to them. \r\n\r\nJohn Cussans is an artist, writer and independent researcher whose current work examines misrepresentations of Haitian Vodou in popular culture, its association with moral panics within the mass media and its role in anti-colonial struggles. In 2009 and 2011 John participated in the Ghetto Biennale in Port-au-Prince and continues to work with the Ti Moun Rezistans artists’ community there. He is currently a visiting research fellow in the Visual Cultures Department of Goldsmiths College. \r\n\r\nLeah Gordon \r\n\r\nVodou and Art: a Border Culture\r\n\r\nLeah Gordon explores the multifarious links between Vodou and art in both Haiti's rich art history and contemporary practice. Leah will discuss the use of image and artifact within Vodou ritual and the often-interchangeable role of artist and Houngan (Vodou priest). To conclude Gordon will explore the liminal space that contemporary artists currently inhabit whilst trying to negotiate their ancestral histories and cultural antecedents within a contemporary art market, which still has a conflicted relationship toward ethnographic and ritual objects\r\n\r\nLeah Gordon is an artist, curator and writer who explores the boundaries between post-colonialism, religion, folk history and art. Her practice investigates the ruptures between Haiti and Britain's intervolved histories and cosmologies. Leah's work has been exhibited internationally including in the National Portrait Gallery, UK, the Museum of Contemporary Art, Sydney and the Dakar Biennale. Leah Gordon co-curated 'Kafou: Haiti, History & Vodou’ at the Nottingham Contemporary, was the adjunct curator for the Haitian Pavilion at the 54th Venice Biennale and was on the curatorial team of 'In Extremis: Death & Life in 21st Century Haitian Art' at the Fowler Museum, Los Angeles and the Musee de la Civilisation, in Quebec City. \r\n\r\n\r\nLouis Martinié \r\n\r\nNew Orleans Voodoo: An Order of Service\r\n\r\nDuring this ritual session conjures developed at ceremonies held between 1995 and 2000 by the New Orleans Voodoo Spiritual Temple will be demonstrated. These conjures are part of a unique Order of Service found only in New Orleans based upon birthing desires, benedictions, or curses. The session will end with an honor bound conformation in this Order of Service given through the loa Blanc Dan-i. The conjures and their rhythmic expressions can be learnt without participating in the confirmation or having prior experience with percussion instruments, rhythms produced by and in the body are effective. \r\n\r\nLouis Martinié is an author and internationally know percussionist, practitioner of New Orleans style Voodoo.

David Pilling’s new book is an entertaining, deeply knowledgeable and surprising analysis of a group of islands which have shown great resilience, both in the face of financial distress and when confronted with the overwhelming disaster of the 2011 earthquake.\r\n\r\nThroughout its history, Japan has weathered calamities from natural disasters such as the 2011 tsunami to crushing defeat in war and its more recent loss of economic vigour.  The 2011 tsunami, which killed some 19,000 people, and subsequent nuclear catastrophe highlighted both the deeply impressive practical resilience of ordinary Japanese and a political culture of extraordinary carelessness and arrogance. Pilling describes the emergency and its aftermath, but then writes far more broadly about many aspects of Japan which are little known to outsiders and which do so much to explain these contradictory responses to the disaster.\r\n\r\nDrawing on a wide range of contemporary Japanese voices and on the author’s own experiences living in Japan as a foreign correspondent for six years, his book draws together many threads – economics, history, politics and contemporary reportage – in one highly readable volume. Its publication coincides with a surge of renewed interest in Japan, still the most important US ally in Asia, as its territorial disputes with China heat up dangerously, its government attempts a radical revival of the economy, and the Fukushima nuclear disaster rumbles on. \r\nBending Adversity is a superb work of reportage and an essential book even for those who already feel they know the country well.", "additional_info": null, "duration": 60, "image_id": 2054, "added": "2013-12-12T23:56:28", "slug": "5be216e8b122c138", "speakers": [{"id": 14368, "name": "Mr David Pilling", "slug": "mr-david-pilling"}], "topics": [{"id": 3014, "name": "journalism", "path": "/politics/journalism"}, {"id": 3596, "name": "japanrelations", "path": "/society/china/japanrelations"}, {"id": 1015, "name": "economics", "path": "/politics/economics"}, {"id": 3597, "name": "japan", "path": "/politics/economics/japan"}, {"id": 3594, "name": "japan", "path": "/society/journalism/talk/japan"}, {"id": 3595, "name": "japan", "path": "/society/politics/economics/japan"}], "supercategory": "politics", "venue": {"id": 2964, "name": "Daiwa Anglo-Japanese Foundation", "slug": "daiwa-anglo-japanese-foundation", "city": "London", "postcode": "NW1 4QP"}, "organizer": {"id": 2964, "name": "Daiwa Anglo-Japanese Foundation", "slug": "daiwa-anglo-japanese-foundation"}, "date": "2014-01-17", "dates": [{"id": 13814, "from_date": "2014-01-17", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "18:00:00", "ticket_cost": "Free; Booking essential", "ticket_info": null, "additional_info": "http://www.dajf.org.uk/event/bending-adversity-japan-and-the-art-of-survival", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 2964, "name": "Daiwa Anglo-Japanese Foundation", "slug": "daiwa-anglo-japanese-foundation", "city": "London", "postcode": "NW1 4QP"}, "organizer": {"id": 2964, "name": "Daiwa Anglo-Japanese Foundation", "slug": "daiwa-anglo-japanese-foundation"}}]}, {"id": 13168, "title": "Law as a new religion and other topics", "synopsis": "How does the ever-expanding legal profession impact on our expectations of the law and the constitution?", "keywords": "Constitutional Law, International Law, Law", "body": "Law is everywhere providing answers to almost everything.

Philosophy is not only the pursuit of truth, but the simultaneous pursuit of beauty: and as Diotima told Socrates, “Perceive you not, that in beholding the beautiful with that eye, with which alone it is possible to behold it, thus, and thus only, could a man ever attain to generate, not the images or semblances of virtue, as not having his intimate commerce with an image or a semblance; but virtue true, real, and substantial, from the converse and embraces of that which is real and true.  Thus begetting true virtue, and bringing her up till she is grown mature, he would become a favourite of the Gods; and at length would be, if any man ever be, himself one of the immortals.”  The restoration of the soul’s divine likeness enlarges its powers, and enables it to join completely the empire of the Good: its work upon the earth and upon itself is thus consummated and transformed.

This talk will argue that at least one variant of it--social democracy--was and might still be by looking back at the role it played in creating the Europe that is in transition today. \r\n\r\nDuring the 19th and first half of the 20th century Europe was the most turbulent region on earth, convulsed by war, economic crises and social and political conflict. Yet during the second half of the 20th century it was among the most stable, a study in democracy and prosperity. How can we understand this remarkable transformation? The answer lies in the changes that occurred after 1945, among the most important of which was a dramatic shift in the understanding of what it would take to ensure democratic consolidaton in Europe. Across the political spectrum a new understanding of democracy developed in Western Europe one that went beyond what think of today as “electoral” or even “liberal” democracy to what is best understood as “social democracy”—a regime type which entails not merely dramatic changes in political arrangements, but in social and economic ones as well. This talk will explain the background and logic of this \"regime type\" as well as consider its continuing relevance today. \r\n\r\nSheri Berman is Professor of Political Science at Columbia University.

There is forensic linguistic evidence submitted in specific cases (e.g. author identification of threats and suicide notes; speaker identification of voicemail and intercepts). There are analyses of the language used in police warnings, witness statements, and cross-examination. There are investigations of storytelling techniques and rhetoric in law reports. There are competing interpretations of the form and meaning of statutes and constitutions. And there are general accounts of the constitutive role of language in shaping what law is, for example by means of linguistic performatives. \r\n\r\nIn this session I will try to distinguish the challenges facing linguistic analysis in these different fields and functions of law. Each area, I will suggest, raises not only different legal questions but often very different linguistic issues. I won't focus on either the legal or the linguistic technicalities, however. Instead, we will use the session to draw out general implications from a series of contrasts between the legal lexicon (law’s terms of art), specialised techniques of legal construction (prescribed, or normative forms of interpretation), and efforts made in law to interpret contested everyday language (for example by appeals to the meaning attributed by the ordinary reader or average consumer). Some of the session will require explication of relevant concepts by me.

Of these, Newgate was the largest, most notorious and worst. Built during the twelfth century, it became a legendary place - the inspiration of more poems, plays and novels than any other building in London. It was a place of cruelty and wretchedness, at various times holding Dick Turpin, Titus Oates, Daniel Defoe, Jack Sheppard and Casanova. Because prisons were privately run, any time spent in prison had to be paid for by the prisoner. Housing varied from a private cell with a cleaning woman and a visiting prostitute, to simply lying on the floor with no cover. Those who died inside - and only a quarter of prisoners survived until their execution day - had to stay in Newgate as a rotting corpse until relatives found the money for the body to be released. Stephen Halliday tells the story of Newgate's origins, the criminals it held, the punishments meted out and its rebuilding and reform. This is a compelling slice of London's social and criminal history.\r\n\r\nDr Stephen Halliday is from the Institute of Continuing Education, University of Cambridge.\r\n\r\nFor more information, please visit the event's page on our website:\r\nhttp://www.gresham.ac.uk/event.asp?PageId=45&EventId=910", "additional_info": null, "duration": 60, "image_id": 1085, "added": "2009-09-24T07:39:58", "slug": "9aa26168b5a2a9a4", "speakers": [{"id": 2816, "name": "Dr Stephen Halliday", "slug": "dr-stephen-halliday"}], "topics": [{"id": 211, "name": "history", "path": "/society/history"}, {"id": 1624, "name": "crime", "path": "/society/crime"}, {"id": 1529, "name": "london", "path": "/society/history/london"}, {"id": 1782, "name": "tudor", "path": "/society/history/tudor"}, {"id": 1301, "name": "prison", "path": "/society/history/prison"}, {"id": 1549, "name": "17thcentury", "path": "/society/history/17thcentury"}, {"id": 1706, "name": "edwardian", "path": "/society/history/edwardian"}, {"id": 349, "name": "history", "path": "/academic/history"}, {"id": 903, "name": "london", "path": "/academic/history/london"}, {"id": 1765, "name": "tudorlondon", "path": "/academic/history/london/tudorlondon"}], "supercategory": "society", "venue": {"id": 414, "name": "The Museum of London", "slug": "the-museum-of-london", "city": "London", "postcode": "EC2Y 5HN"}, "organizer": {"id": 20, "name": "Gresham College", "slug": "gresham-college"}, "date": "2009-10-12", "dates": [{"id": 7534, "from_date": "2009-10-12", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "13:00:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": null, "additional_info": null, "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 414, "name": "The Museum of London", "slug": "the-museum-of-london", "city": "London", "postcode": "EC2Y 5HN"}, "organizer": {"id": 20, "name": "Gresham College", "slug": "gresham-college"}}]}, {"id": 7161, "title": "The Crisis of Global Capitalism: ten years on", "synopsis": "Ralph Miliband Series on The Future of Global Capitalism ", "keywords": "global, globalisation, capitalism, politics", "body": null, "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 732, "added": "2009-09-18T09:39:04", "slug": "86d54e4c72329a0f", "speakers": [{"id": 782, "name": "Professor John Gray", "slug": "professor-john-gray"}, {"id": 7416, "name": "Martin Jacques", "slug": "martin-jacques"}], "topics": [{"id": 527, "name": "politics", "path": "/politics/local/politics"}, {"id": 538, "name": "politics", "path": "/arts/photography/politics"}, {"id": 713, "name": "politics", "path": "/society/war/politics"}, {"id": 938, "name": "politics", "path": "/politics/philosophy/politics"}], "supercategory": "politics", "venue": {"id": 1521, "name": "Old Theatre, London School of Economics & Political Science", "slug": "old-theatre-london-school-of-economics-political-science", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC2A 2AE"}, "organizer": {"id": 1287, "name": "London School of Economics & Political Science", "slug": "london-school-of-economics-political-science"}, "date": "2009-10-21", "dates": [{"id": 7502, "from_date": "2009-10-21", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "18:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": "The event is free and open to all with no ticket required.

Land not only provides the nation with food and places to build, but also with clean water, protection from flooding, carbon stewardship and green spaces for our health and wellbeing.  We all need more of these environmental services, but they are not adequately valued or provided for.  Land use planning and farming policy have an important part to play, but they are no panacea and attention should turn to other sources of funding for the answers we need.  \r\nThrough better management we can get more from our land in the face of development, climate change and other pressures. We need to harness new sources of investment and new partnerships to realise land’s potential to provide benefits for us all.\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 120, "image_id": null, "added": "2008-09-15T00:43:43", "slug": "acecc2cac90340d1", "speakers": [{"id": 7306, "name": "Tony Burton", "slug": "tony-burton"}], "topics": [{"id": 251, "name": "wildlife", "path": "/children/science/wildlife"}, {"id": 1003, "name": "wildlife", "path": "/leisure/wildlife/wildlife"}, {"id": 1115, "name": "wildlife", "path": "/science/environment/wildlife"}, {"id": 1118, "name": "wildlife", "path": "/business/management/wildlife"}], "supercategory": "children", "venue": {"id": 1089, "name": "Birkbeck, University of London", "slug": "birkbeck-university-of-london", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC1E 7HX"}, "organizer": {"id": 1069, "name": "Ecology and Conservation Studies Society", "slug": "ecology-and-conservation-studies-society"}, "date": "2008-11-21", "dates": [{"id": 6095, "from_date": "2008-11-21", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "18:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": "For free tickets and venue details, contact tel:  020 7679 1069, or e-mail:   environment@fce.bbk.ac.uk", "additional_info": "Booking essential", "members_only": "No", "members_info": "Details of the Society and application forms will be available at the door, and are on our website http://www.bbk.ac.uk/ce/environment/ecssociety/index.shtml", "venue": {"id": 1089, "name": "Birkbeck, University of London", "slug": "birkbeck-university-of-london", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC1E 7HX"}, "organizer": {"id": 1069, "name": "Ecology and Conservation Studies Society", "slug": "ecology-and-conservation-studies-society"}}]}, {"id": 5693, "title": "Unitarianism", "synopsis": "Sir Peter Soulsby MP will speak about Unitarianism ", "keywords": "Unitarianism ", "body": "To close our Open Day, Sir Peter Soulsby MP will speak about Unitarianism - The origins of the national secular society grew out of unitarianism.

The concept of the &#8216;holy well&#8217;, with its medicinal healing properties has been firmly established since antiquity. London originally boasted many such wells, which sadly have been mostly lost, except in street or place names. With the use of modern mapping techniques and research into historical documents it is now possible to pin-point the location of these wells and to discover what has happened to them. Although water is a natural phenomenon these wells can often be found on the alignments within the capital, such as the &#8216;holy well&#8217; in the Strand, which suggests there may be a connection between the two. London&#8217;s alignments were certainly formulated in Roman times but there are hints that the patterns pre-dated that period and that these were also used in the development of London, possibly through Masonic influence. For example &#8216;The Broadwalk&#8217;, in Regents Park, established by John Nash in the 18th century, is precisely aligned to the tumulus on Hampstead Heath. This hidden heritage should not be lost and may have relevance to the future development of London.  \r\n\r\nDavid Furlong  has been researching landscape patterns for more than thirty years. He is the author of five books including, Working With Earth Energies and The Keys to the Temple, which explored the hidden geometry of the Marlborough Downs and its link to the Avebury complex. He is at present researching the lost wells of London for a future book.       \r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 60, "image_id": null, "added": "2006-09-08T14:08:23", "slug": "5dc234dd97188424", "speakers": [{"id": 4372, "name": "David Furlong", "slug": "david-furlong"}], "topics": [{"id": 832, "name": "mysticism", "path": "/religion/mysticism"}, {"id": 902, "name": "london", "path": "/arts/archaeology/london"}, {"id": 903, "name": "london", "path": "/academic/history/london"}, {"id": 321, "name": "geometry", "path": "/academic/geometry"}], "supercategory": "religion", "venue": {"id": 827, "name": "Research Into Lost Knowledge Organisation", "slug": "research-into-lost-knowledge-organisation", "city": "London", "postcode": "SW7 5HR"}, "organizer": {"id": 826, "name": "Research Into Lost Knowledge Organisation", "slug": "research-into-lost-knowledge-organisation"}, "date": "2007-02-23", "dates": [{"id": 3577, "from_date": "2007-02-23", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "19:15:00", "ticket_cost": "£7 (members £5)", "ticket_info": "On the door.", "additional_info": "Doors open at 6.45 and close at 7.30pm.

Holloway believes that one the main problems of multiculturalism is the new assertiveness of strong religion. He warns: ‘Strongly held religious beliefs do not comport very well with the kind of tolerance that is the necessary lubricant in multicultural societies. The real test of multiculturalism is being fought out in the US, where the religious right is not interested in co-existing, only in wresting control and taking over.’ Goodhart’s essay in Prospect last year ‘Too Diverse?’ launched a national debate on the potential conflict between diversity and the solidarity required to sustain a high-tax welfare society. He argues that if Britain’s common culture is eroded too far by multiculturalism the country will end up like America — highly diverse but also highly individualistic, unequal and racially balkanised. Instead of multiculturalism we need an ideology of liberal, inclusive national citizenship.\r\n\r\n\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 60, "image_id": 12, "added": "2005-11-10T07:24:10", "slug": "22e3530717e95ac6", "speakers": [{"id": 1978, "name": "Dr Richard Holloway", "slug": "dr-richard-holloway"}, {"id": 3249, "name": "Mr David Goodhart", "slug": "mr-david-goodhart"}], "topics": [{"id": 526, "name": "multiculturalism", "path": "/politics/multiculturalism"}], "supercategory": "politics", "venue": {"id": 17, "name": "Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA)", "slug": "institute-of-contemporary-arts-ica", "city": "London", "postcode": "SW1Y 5AH"}, "organizer": {"id": 17, "name": "Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA)", "slug": "institute-of-contemporary-arts-ica"}, "date": "2005-11-21", "dates": [{"id": 2647, "from_date": "2005-11-21", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "19:00:00", "ticket_cost": "£8, £7 conc, £6 ICA members", "ticket_info": "ICA Box Office 020 7930 3647", "additional_info": null, "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 17, "name": "Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA)", "slug": "institute-of-contemporary-arts-ica", "city": "London", "postcode": "SW1Y 5AH"}, "organizer": {"id": 17, "name": "Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA)", "slug": "institute-of-contemporary-arts-ica"}}]}, {"id": 2413, "title": "Lecture Series: The Royal Navy in the French Wars, 1793-1815: Part 2", "synopsis": "Weekly lecture series over eight weeks examining the Royal Navy in the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars.", "keywords": "history, naval, Nelson", "body": "The second of two complementary lecture series examining the Royal Navy in the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars.
