Sibling of the enigmatic, hedonistic peer Lord ‘Naps’ Alington, the family pile was the magical Crichel Estate in Dorset. The blond, tubercular Naps was matched only in devil may care attitude by his younger sister Lois, a delectable, quixotic creature,an accomplished actress and dancer, a clever painter who studied at the Slade School of Art and had her own art studio in Chelsea. She also became a successful race horse owner and breeder of Great Danes. But Lois’ story is largely untold. She was deemed “fast” and “high-spirited”: Lois wanted to knock the stuffing out of convention and achieved this by engaging in several long love affairs, generally with older, married men. She was for four years the lover of the much older Reggie Herbert, 15th Earl of Pembroke, and an intimate around the string of unapproved-of good-time girls chasing Prince George, the ill-fated Duke of Kent. In 1928 Lois entered into an arranged, madcap marriage de convenance with the homosexual Hon. Evan Frederic Morgan, heir to the Viscount Tredegar and died suddenly in Budapest in 1937, a victim of long years of alcohol abuse and insane slimming treatments.

Friday 7th December 2018, 14.30 – 15.30\r\n\r\nWhere? Room V105, Vine building, Middlesex University, London, NW4 4BT\r\n\r\nThe experience and awareness of death and dying is a constitutive factor of human existence. For some philosophies, world views and religions death is the ultimate horizon against which finite existence acquires meaning and becomes liveable. For others, the experience of death is an experience of the breakdown of all meaning and death is “the scandal of philosophy”. For still others, death and life are two sides of the same coin, mutually enabling each other even to the point where death becomes the gateway to life or another life and living and dying merge, while there are also views which hold that while we are here death is not, and when death is here, we are not, so there is nothing problematic about the end of life called death, except perhaps that we haven’t found a way to prolong life indefinitely. Not really living or not living well is far worse than death or dying. We know our deepest grief, loss and fear in the face of death but also hope, equanimity and even gratitude. Mortality is as central to human existence as the fact that we have language. The human being is the animal rationale who vivifies her life by the conscious expression of it, no less than the one who is moribund (humus, soil), because she knows she is.\r\n\r\nSo however we choose or come to live in the face of mortality, our own and that of others, it is clear that death has a profound connection to meaning. In this paper I will not so much investigate different views, analyses, understandings or ways of talking about death, but rather look at how speech shapes itself in the face of death. The confrontation with death urges us to speak as speaking seems the only way of meeting something that completely overpowers us, and yet death is also an ultimate experience that leaves us often literally speechless so that silence seems the only response commensurate with the event; every word is too much and not enough at the same time. Yet a death that finds no words at all is not human and more traumatic than death itself is anyway. What happens to language at this limit-point of human existence, where words and silence light up as dependent on each other in a way we do not understand? Rhetoric, as a way of reflecting about language and meaning and as a practical engagement with speaking, since its beginning recognized that speech involves the head, the heart and the body – the whole human being. It also has a long history of speaking to death; the genre of the eulogy is a standard form in oratory. Rhetoric as it is pursued today no longer is the mere art of persuasion, but the attempt to become conscious, in theory and practice, of what it means to be a speaking being. I will align myself with this view of rhetoric and explore what it can contribute to the question how to live with the disquieting and urgent drive of speaking in the face of death. This, in the end, is a question about wisdom.\r\n\r\nBIONOTE\r\nsiebers_johan\r\n\r\nJohan Siebers is Associate Professor of Philosophy and Religion at Middlesex University.

What is the reality and what do we know about making smart software?\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the Internet and World Wide Web have transformed our lives. However, our understanding of these systems when used by millions globally is still in its infancy. What are the insights that studying these Social Machines provide to help us understand the evolving Web of the 21st Century?\r\n\r\nOpen data published on the Web is improving the efficiency of our public services and giving rise to open innovation. Data collected at scale by public and private agencies also gives rise to concerns about its use and abuse. This data deluge also presents challenges.\r\n\r\nThis lecture will discuss these fast moving developments and how they complement each other.\r\n\r\nBiography: Sir Nigel Shadbolt is Professor of Computer Science at the University of Oxford and Principal of Jesus College. He is also the Chairman and Co-Founder of the Open Data Institute (ODI). Since 2009, Sir Nigel has acted as an Information Adviser to the UK Government, helping transform public access to Government information, including the widely acclaimed data.gov.uk site.\r\n\r\nWith over 500 publications he researches and publishes on computer science, artificial intelligence, open data and web science. During his career, he has also worked in philosophy, psychology and linguistics. Since 2000 he has secured 17 projects as Principal Investigator with a value of over £20 million pounds. He is currently Principal Investigator on a £6.14M EPSRC funded Programme Grant researching the theory of social machines - Web scale problem solving systems comprising large numbers of humans and computers. \r\n\r\nIn 2006 he was one of three founding Directors of Garlik Ltd, which in 2008 was awarded Technology Pioneer status by the Davos World Economic Forum and won the prestigious UK national BT Flagship Award.  Garlik was acquired by Experian Ltd in 2011.  In 2013 he was awarded a Knighthood for services to science and engineering. \r\n\r\nAll are welcome and attendance is free.

Doctor Of The Lost is the fictionalised story of Dr Barnardo’s early years in East London.\r\n\r\nAuthor Simon Blumenfeld grew up in the same streets, and his cult 1935 novel Jew Boy captures the magic of the Jewish East End of the 1930s. In Doctor Of The Lost (first published in 1938) he sets about recreating the London of Dr Barnardo, drawing on his knowledge of Whitechapel and friendship with Barnardo’s widow. Blumenfeld brings Tom Barnardo vividly to life, showing his inner emotions as well as the battles he faced.\r\n\r\nDoctor Of The Lost shows London at a time of rampant industrialisation, when a few became very wealthy at the expense of many, but it was also a period of charity and good works, when idealists such as Dr Barnardo were prepared to stand up and be counted.\r\n\r\nCopies of Doctor Of The Lost, published by London Books, will be available on the night. \r\n\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 60, "image_id": null, "added": "2013-09-20T09:08:23", "slug": "a6ef2b64aaed90d4", "speakers": [{"id": 14119, "name": "Mr Paolo Hewitt", "slug": "mr-paolo-hewitt"}], "topics": [{"id": 821, "name": "london", "path": "/academic/history/war/london"}, {"id": 1889, "name": "london", "path": "/arts/history/localhistory/london"}, {"id": 2009, "name": "london", "path": "/academic/politics/europe/london"}, {"id": 2101, "name": "london", "path": "/arts/history/enlightenment/london"}], "supercategory": "academic", "venue": {"id": 2153, "name": "The Wheatsheaf", "slug": "the-wheatsheaf", "city": "London ", "postcode": "W1T 1DG"}, "organizer": {"id": 2149, "name": "Sohemian Society", "slug": "sohemian-society"}, "date": "2013-09-30", "dates": [{"id": 13553, "from_date": "2013-09-30", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "19:30:00", "ticket_cost": "£4", "ticket_info": "From door on evening.", "additional_info": "Contact David.Fogarty@prsformusic.com", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 2153, "name": "The Wheatsheaf", "slug": "the-wheatsheaf", "city": "London ", "postcode": "W1T 1DG"}, "organizer": {"id": 2149, "name": "Sohemian Society", "slug": "sohemian-society"}}]}, {"id": 12972, "title": "Alternatives to Religion: Charles Bradlaugh", "synopsis": "Deborah Lavin & Bryan Niblett present a biographical picture of Charles Bradlaugh  - radical and the first atheist Member of Parliament", "keywords": "atheism, infidel, radical, politics,Charles Bradlaugh, Parliament", "body": "Bradlaugh: Rationalist and Freethinker\r\nBradlaugh’s political radicalism, his fight to take his parliamentary seat and his prosecution alongside Annie Besant for having published a birth control pamphlet now generally get more prominence than the importance Bradlaugh placed on atheism.

His television and online reports have tracked the social and economic impact of the global meltdown from the mean streets of Gary, Indiana to the elite salons of Davos. \r\n\r\nSuggested hashtag for this event for Twitter users: #lserevolt \r\n\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 732, "added": "2011-12-03T12:07:21", "slug": "12c3c456cf3f17cc", "speakers": [{"id": 7615, "name": "BBC Storyville Editor Paul Mason", "slug": "bbc-storyville-editor-paul-mason"}], "topics": [{"id": 2478, "name": "revolution", "path": "/politics/democracy/politics/revolution"}, {"id": 2395, "name": "sociology", "path": "/academic/sociology/sociology"}, {"id": 2405, "name": "revolution", "path": "/politics/economics/revolution"}, {"id": 1929, "name": "economic", "path": "/academic/economic"}], "supercategory": "politics", "venue": {"id": 1287, "name": "London School of Economics & Political Science", "slug": "london-school-of-economics-political-science", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC2A 2AE"}, "organizer": {"id": 1287, "name": "London School of Economics & Political Science", "slug": "london-school-of-economics-political-science"}, "date": "2012-01-30", "dates": [{"id": 10871, "from_date": "2012-01-30", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "18:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": "This event is free and open to all with no ticket required.

contemporary art practice, this  international conference explores the relationship between historical research and artists’ methods and processes when working with recorded images found in

how they inform and challenge conventional methods of historical research.\r\n\r\nOf central concern are the aesthetic strategies and ethics of the recorded image when interrogating unrepresented and un-mined histories, and the potential of these forms of interrogation to open new social, political, and cultural discourses.\r\n\r\nThe conference touches on compilation filmmaking in relation to contemporary historical events, documentary strategies, personal and collective memory, approaches to the archive across differing contexts, and the inherent complexities in encountering and working with materials of the past.\r\n\r\nContributors include: Sven Agustijnen, Frederique Berthet, Adam Broomberg, Filipa Cesar, Oliver Chanarin, TJ Demos, Mary Ann Doane, Nanina Guyer, Mark Nash, Colin

Ms. Pillay, a South African national, was the first woman to start a law practice in her home province of Natal in 1967. Over the next few years, she acted as a defense attorney for anti-apartheid activists, exposing torture, and helping establish key rights for prisoners on Robben Island. \r\n\r\nShe also worked as a lecturer at the University of KwaZulu-Natal, and later was appointed Vice-President of the University of Durban Westville.

She played a critical role in the ICTR's groundbreaking jurisprudence on rape as genocide, as well as on issues of freedom of speech and hate propaganda. In 2003, she was appointed as a judge on the International Criminal Court in the Hague, where she remained until August 2008. \r\n\r\nIn South Africa, as a member of the Women's National Coalition, she contributed to the inclusion of an equality clause in the country’s Constitution that prohibits discrimination on grounds of race, religion and sexual orientation. She co-founded Equality Now, an international women's rights organization, and has been involved with other organizations working on issues relating to children, detainees, victims of torture and of domestic violence, and a range of economic, social and cultural rights. \r\n\r\nMs. Pillay received a BA and a LLB from Natal University South Africa.

Today, after another century of environmental exploitation and continuing urbanisation, this isolation is far more extreme. \r\n\r\nWe need to reconnect urban life with the patterns and rhythms of the natural world, for urgent practical and spiritual reasons.   Poets have expressed the yearning for connection as a basic human need.  Politicians have woken up to the value of urban parks, as studies have shown that a healthy, green environment offers  benefits ranging from improved social cohesion and lower crime to better mental and physical health.   Perhaps most urgently, we need to be reminded of our dependence on natural processes and our interdependence with other living things, so that we make responsible choices in our daily lives for the sake of all life on earth.\r\n\r\nA short stay in beautiful countryside can offer us inspiration, but most of us are town or city dwellers, and need to stay as such for the sake of the planet.  There's not room for us all in the countryside!  How can we work towards sustainable city greening, while preserving real wildness in a working landscape?\r\n\r\nWe won't spend long on statistics of environmental degredation or prospects for impending disaster.  Sometimes the facts can overwhelm us.  Information alone doesn't give understanding and rarely leads to action. This will be an evening for reflection and for celebration.  I'll introduce the theme with slides and readings, but there will also be time for participants to share readings they have brought with them and for creative listening.

How are speech and language difficulties constructed around differences in language development in English and other languages? To what extent do speech and language difficulties result from material language learning needs in two languages? \r\n\r\nIt focuses on two categories of difficulty: difficulties in reading related to speech difficulties (dyslexia), and difficulties in fluent speech (dysfluency, also known as stammering and stuttering). I take them as examples to discuss how bilingual speakers may show these difficulties, and to interrogate the extent to which bilingualism may be thought to cause or exacerbate language difficulties. I will also look at what is meant by intervention. Is intervention successful only through individual-based clinical models which focus on language processing? Can we successfully support speech and language difficulties in inclusive education settings? Is intervention successful in one or both languages?\r\n\r\nThrough this discussion we may obtain more insight into how we theorise speech and language difficulties, and how working with bilingual speakers can advance understanding of both speech and language and difficulties and approaches to intervention.\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 60, "image_id": null, "added": "2004-05-17T12:20:46", "slug": "b474524ce27cb5eb", "speakers": [], "topics": [], "supercategory": "academic", "venue": {"id": 200, "name": "Essex University, Linguistics Dept", "slug": "essex-university-linguistics-dept", "city": "Colchester", "postcode": "CO4 3SQ"}, "organizer": {"id": 200, "name": "Essex University, Linguistics Dept", "slug": "essex-university-linguistics-dept"}, "date": "2004-05-27", "dates": [{"id": 619, "from_date": "2004-05-27", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "16:00:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": null, "additional_info": "Directions and map available at \"http://www.essex.ac.uk/about/find.html\":http://www.essex.ac.uk/about/find.html", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 200, "name": "Essex University, Linguistics Dept", "slug": "essex-university-linguistics-dept", "city": "Colchester", "postcode": "CO4 3SQ"}, "organizer": {"id": 200, "name": "Essex University, Linguistics Dept", "slug": "essex-university-linguistics-dept"}}]}, {"id": 499, "title": "In the Headlines", "synopsis": "Regular platform for visitors to examine, question and discuss the hottest science issues, directly with the scientists creating the news.", "keywords": "science, news", "body": "Research into the natural world features regularly in the news.
