But what of the beings and spirits that make Halloween? Join our speakers as they examine the world of vampires, zombies and ghosts. \r\n\r\nVampires with Deborah Hyde- \"The Vampire has fascinated Western Europe from the early 1700s, but the tradition was a real part of Eastern European lives for a considerable time before that. In the last three centuries, the icon has been taken up by art of all kinds - literature, film and graphics - and it has had a lasting effect on fashion and culture. But what is the authentic story behind tales of the predatory, living dead and can we understand a little more about being human by studying these accounts? We will look at recent attempts to understand the folklore and try to work out how an Eastern European ritual made its way to late nineteenth century New England, USA.\r\n\r\nThe Psychology of Ghosts and Hauntings with Chris French- This talk will consider a number of factors that may lead people to claim that they have experienced a ghost even though they may not in fact have done so. Topics covered will include hoaxes, sincere misinterpretation of natural phenomena, hallucinatory experiences and pareidolia (seeing things that are not there), the fallibility of eyewitness testimony, the possible role of complex electromagnetic fields and infrasound, photographic evidence, EVP, and the role of the media.\r\n\r\nZombies with Frank Swain- Ever wanted to make your own army of un-dead servants? Join author Frank Swain as he reveals 300 years of reanimation and mind control experiments. You learn the tricks, techniques and toxins that everyone from clandestine government scientists to crazed basement obsessives have used in their quest to raise the dead and enslave the living.\r\n\r\nGhosts of London* with Scott Wood- In London you are never more than ten feet from a ghost story*. Ghosts have been an enduring part of London’s history, folklore and media and it seems that nothing of note can take place in the city without planting new ghosts.\r\n(*maybe)\r\n\r\nDetails can be found at -https://humanism.org.uk/events/?page=CiviCRM&q=civicrm/event/info&id=34&reset=1\r\n\r\nENDS\r\n\r\nNotes to editors\r\nTime and date:\tOctober 26th, 2013 10:30 AM   through   3:30 PM\r\nVenue:\t  Conway Hall, 25 Red Lion Square, London, WC1R 4RL\r\nTickets:  General £10.00 \r\n                 Members and Students £5.00\r\n                 Friends of CFI Free\r\n                 Tickets can be bought here- https://humanism.org.uk/events/?page=CiviCRM&q=civicrm/event/register&id=34&reset=1\r\n\r\nFor further comment or press passes contact Sara Passmore on 020 7079 3586 or by email at sara@humanism.org.uk. \r\n\r\nAbout the speakers: \r\n\r\nChris French is a Professor of Psychology and Head of the Anomalistic Psychology Research Unit in the Psychology Department at Goldsmiths, University of London. He has published over 100 articles and chapters covering a wide range of topics within psychology. In addition to academic activities, he frequently appears on radio and television casting a sceptical eye over paranormal claims. He is a columnist for The Skeptic magazine (UK version) and served as editor for over a decade. He also writes for the Guardian’s online science pages. Humanists would find much of interest in his recent publication, with W M, Grossman, Why Statues Weep: The Best of The Skeptic (The Philosophy Press). Buy it at Amazon.co.uk through this link and a small commission will go to the BHA.\r\n\r\nDeborah Hyde writes articles, lectures internationally, and appears on broadcast media to discuss superstition, religion and belief in the supernatural. She uses a range of approaches and disciplines from history to psychology to investigate the folklore of the malign and to discover why it is so persistent throughout all human communities & eras. She is currently writing a book ‘Unnatural Predators’. She is also a film industry makeup effects production manager who gets on the wrong side of the camera from time to time.\r\n\r\nFrank Swain writes and talks about science. His first book, HOW TO MAKE A ZOMBIE, is out now from Oneworld.

However, the exact meaning of this vague goal was not clear, and consequently the Nazi anti-Jewish project turned into an escalating trial-and-error enterprise, in which different orientations pointed to different directions and even quarrelled with each other. During the first years (1933-1937) those policies - whether legal, economic or social - had an abstract \"Jew\" in mind but targeted individual Jews or (the many) existing Jewish organizations. It was the Jewish Department of the SD (SS Security Service) which in 1937 started to develop a concept of conducting anti-Jewish policies through dealing with \"heads', i.e. authoritative representatives, of the Jews as a collective. As the SS was eager to become the dominant force in shaping and implementing anti-Jewish policies, it wanted to both implement the headship idea and be the German agency controlling them. The concept was indeed implemented, step-by-step, and resulted in the establishment of an enormous number of Judenvereinigungen (Associations of Jews) and Judenraete (Jewish Councils), usually initiated and often controlled by SS agencies, throughout Europe and North Africa. These headships were neither part of the \"ghettoization\" process, nor an inherent part of the Final Solution, although they played a role in both.\r\n\r\nIn this lecture the emergence of the 'headship' concept in the Nazi bureaucracy and its complicated implementation process in the varying settings will be depicted and analysed, thus shedding light on the ways in which administrative concepts and fervent antisemitism created effective tools for the persecution of the Jewish communities during the Holocaust.\r\n\r\nDan Michman is Professor of Modern Jewish History and Chair of the Arnold and Leona Finkler Institute of Holocaust Research at Bar-Ilan University.", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": null, "added": "2013-01-14T23:37:01", "slug": "4d8219ee33e7fd5a", "speakers": [{"id": 13401, "name": "Professor Dan Michman", "slug": "professor-dan-michman"}], "topics": [{"id": 3249, "name": "holocaust", "path": "/academic/history/worldwarii/holocaust"}, {"id": 852, "name": "holocaust", "path": "/society/history/holocaust"}], "supercategory": "academic", "venue": {"id": 1886, "name": "The Wiener Library for the Study of the Holocaust and Genocide", "slug": "the-wiener-library-for-the-study-of-the-holocaust-and-genocide", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC1B 5DP"}, "organizer": {"id": 1886, "name": "The Wiener Library for the Study of the Holocaust and Genocide", "slug": "the-wiener-library-for-the-study-of-the-holocaust-and-genocide"}, "date": "2013-01-24", "dates": [{"id": 12551, "from_date": "2013-01-24", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "18:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": "Admission is free, but places must be reserved in advance at http://www.wienerlibrary.co.uk/Whats-On", "additional_info": null, "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 1886, "name": "The Wiener Library for the Study of the Holocaust and Genocide", "slug": "the-wiener-library-for-the-study-of-the-holocaust-and-genocide", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC1B 5DP"}, "organizer": {"id": 1886, "name": "The Wiener Library for the Study of the Holocaust and Genocide", "slug": "the-wiener-library-for-the-study-of-the-holocaust-and-genocide"}}]}, {"id": 12011, "title": "Live from Downing Street: The inside story of power, politics and the media ", "synopsis": "British Government @ LSE public lecture \r\n", "keywords": "politics, bbc, journalism, great britain", "body": "Live from Downing Street| is the BBC’s political editor’s colourful and personal account of the relationship between the men and women who wield power and those whose job it is to tell the public what they are doing which he will speak about in this lecture at LSE.

Yet the progress he expected could not be easily reconciled with his sense of evolutionary contingency. A man who, in the name of suffering slaves, damned the white man’s ‘arrogance’ in believing himself the ‘godlike’ goal of creation, could not rest comfortably in believing that history must realize his own highest moral goal, black emancipation. In the 1850s, Darwin’s dilemma became increasingly poignant as the conflict over slavery in the United States turned into a holocaust. He could still hope for abolition, but in a dark hour he had to admit, ‘a man cannot hope by intention’. It was only after the emancipation of America’s slaves in the 1860s, when he turned at last to publish on human origins, that Darwin’s optimism revived. In the Descent of Man, ‘the great sin of slavery’ is among the evils to be abolished as ‘the civilised races of man … exterminate and replace’ races that were formerly enslaved. ‘At some future period’, not many centuries hence, Darwin prophesied, ‘virtue will be triumphant’.", "keywords": "Science, History, Abolition, Social Reform", "body": "James Moore is co-author with Adrian Desmond of the best-selling biography Darwin (1991) and of Darwin Sacred Cause: Race, Slavery and the Quest for Human Origins (2009), hailed by the London Review of Books as the Darwin anniversary year’s ‘most substantial historical contribution’.

Washing machines that warn users when colours are mixed together and fridges which sound a warning when left open were among the devices tested.This talk gives an overview of the project and considers some of the wider applications of Assistive Technologies.\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": null, "added": "2010-06-17T22:09:21", "slug": "24f739ec99876f7e", "speakers": [{"id": 9884, "name": "Professor Vic Grout", "slug": "professor-vic-grout"}, {"id": 9885, "name": "Dr Richard Pickering", "slug": "dr-richard-pickering"}], "topics": [{"id": 2184, "name": "elderlyanddisabled", "path": "/science/technology/elderlyanddisabled"}], "supercategory": "science", "venue": {"id": 2105, "name": "Glyndwr University", "slug": "glyndwr-university", "city": "Wrexham", "postcode": "LL11 2AW"}, "organizer": {"id": 2105, "name": "Glyndwr University", "slug": "glyndwr-university"}, "date": "2010-07-08", "dates": [{"id": 8815, "from_date": "2010-07-08", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "19:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": "www.wrexhamsf.com\r\nwsf@glyndwr.ac.uk\r\n01978 293466", "additional_info": null, "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 2105, "name": "Glyndwr University", "slug": "glyndwr-university", "city": "Wrexham", "postcode": "LL11 2AW"}, "organizer": {"id": 2105, "name": "Glyndwr University", "slug": "glyndwr-university"}}]}, {"id": 8350, "title": "Cosmetic Neuroscience", "synopsis": "Katerina Deligiorgi leads a talk and discussion about cosmetic neuroscience", "keywords": "philosophy, science, ethics", "body": "The alteration of our bodies for aesthetic reasons may be becoming acceptable, even normal in developed Western societies.

Less violent? Or simply happier? Would you choose to take something like that? Would you vote to put it in the drinking water or to ban it as a violation of our fundamental human nature? For millennia the mind has been held above the body, separate from and superior to it. The mind, many religions tell us, continues to exist after the death of the body. For Descartes, of course, the mind was the only thing of which one could be absolutely sure: cogito, ergo sum.What we think, far more than our bodies, makes us who we are. This is perhaps what makes brain damage or senility, for many, so much more distressing a thought than physical injury or disease. Has all of this dualism come to an end in our materialistic, naturalistic age? If so, shouldn’t we be pushing the boundaries of medical technology in order to be the best people we can be?

As radical scientist, philosopher, mystic and theologian, Emanuel Swedenborg (1688 -1772) was a pervasive presence in Romantic, symbolist and gothic literature throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.

What is the role of an engineer in today’s business environment?", "synopsis": "Sir Terry Matthews discusses the advent of consumer engineering and the importance of business involvement of the engineers themselves.", "keywords": "Engineers, engineering, engineer, business, Sir Terry Matthews", "body": "With the move to outsourcing and off-shoring the role of the engineer in the western world is radically changing.  It is no longer the case of ‘how to make something’ but more of a question of ‘what to make’ to enhance business profitability and increase the value of intellectual property.  \r\n\r\nIn his keynote speech, Sir Terry Matthews will discuss how the engineering role has changed over the years, the advent of consumer engineering and how important it is that engineers become intrinsically involved with customers and businesses as a whole.      \r\n\r\nSir Terence Matthews is Chairman of Wesley Clover and also serves as Chairman of Mitel and March Networks, two companies active in developing Internet Protocol (IP) systems for enterprise applications. \r\n\r\nPrior to joining March Networks, he served as CEO and Chairman of Newbridge Networks Corporation, a company he founded in 1986. Providing leadership and vision for 14 years, Terry helped Newbridge become a leader in the worldwide data networking industry. When France-based Alcatel acquired Newbridge in May 2000, the company employed more than 6,500 employees and recorded FY 1999 revenue of $1.8 billion. In 1972, before launching Newbridge, Terry co-founded Mitel Corporation. Under his leadership Mitel grew quickly to become a world leader in the design and manufacture of enterprise voice systems and products. In 1985, British Telecom bought controlling interest in Mitel. \r\n\r\nIn 2001, Terry purchased the worldwide Communications Systems division of Mitel, and the Mitel name, and is now owner and non-executive Chairman of Mitel Corporation, a company focused on providing next generation IP telephony solutions for broadband networks. Terry also serves on the board of directors for a number of high technology companies and is Chairman or serves on the Board of Directors of Bridgewater Systems, Solace Systems and NewHeights Software. \r\n\r\nIn addition Terry holds an honours degree in electronics from the University of Wales, Swansea and is a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering. He has been awarded honorary doctorates by several universities, including the University of Wales, Glamorgan and Swansea, and Carleton University in Ottawa. In 1994, he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire, and in the 2001 Queen's Birthday Honours, he was awarded a Knighthood.\r\n\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 150, "image_id": null, "added": "2007-04-30T11:28:34", "slug": "ccd8edd3c589b85a", "speakers": [{"id": 5428, "name": "Sir Terry Matthews", "slug": "sir-terry-matthews"}], "topics": [{"id": 778, "name": "engineering", "path": "/science/engineering/engineering/engineering"}, {"id": 777, "name": "engineering", "path": "/science/engineering/engineering"}, {"id": 1060, "name": "engineering", "path": "/society/technology/engineering"}, {"id": 151, "name": "porousmaterials", "path": "/science/engineering/porousmaterials"}], "supercategory": "science", "venue": {"id": 1337, "name": "The IET", "slug": "the-iet", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC2R 0BL"}, "organizer": {"id": 1337, "name": "The IET", "slug": "the-iet"}, "date": "2007-05-15", "dates": [{"id": 4475, "from_date": "2007-05-15", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "17:30:00", "ticket_cost": "free", "ticket_info": "Registration is free and open to non-members but a requirement for logistical and security purposes.

The surprise can be delightful, disturbing, funny, alarming or unexpected. The slides I will show illustrate all these, plus the hidden messages and intentions of such fans in their historical context. I will also touch on the subject of provenance and the emotions aroused by fans whose former owners were famous in their day,” said Hélène Alexander \r\nThe Fan Museum is the only museum in the world entirely dedicated to the history of fans and to the art and craft of fan making. Mrs Alexander and her husband set up The Fan Museum in 1991 in order to share her passion for the fan. Essentially a cooling device, the fan has also been status symbol, fashion accessory and advertising give-away. Collections held by The Fan Museum now include over 3000 fans and fan leaves from all over the world, spanning over nine centuries.\r\n\r\nsee: http://www.bangor.ac.uk/news/events.php.en?menu=4&catid=3981&subid=0", "additional_info": null, "duration": 60, "image_id": null, "added": "2006-10-25T18:26:04", "slug": "hidden-depths-the-fan-an-object-of-mystery", "speakers": [{"id": 4569, "name": "Mrs Hélène Alexander FRSA", "slug": "mrs-hélène-alexander-frsa"}, {"id": 4569, "name": "Mrs Hélène Alexander FRSA", "slug": "mrs-hélène-alexander-frsa"}], "topics": [], "supercategory": "academic", "venue": {"id": 770, "name": "University of Wales, Bangor", "slug": "university-of-wales-bangor", "city": "Bangor", "postcode": "LL57 2DG"}, "organizer": {"id": 770, "name": "University of Wales, Bangor", "slug": "university-of-wales-bangor"}, "date": "2006-11-08", "dates": [{"id": 3767, "from_date": "2006-11-08", "to_date": "2006-11-08", "time": "18:00:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": null, "additional_info": " Takes place in the Main Arts Lecture Theatre", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 770, "name": "University of Wales, Bangor", "slug": "university-of-wales-bangor", "city": "Bangor", "postcode": "LL57 2DG"}, "organizer": {"id": 770, "name": "University of Wales, Bangor", "slug": "university-of-wales-bangor"}}]}, {"id": 3560, "title": "Tony Bevan - In Coversation", "synopsis": "Artist Tony Beven in conversation with Richard Cork", "keywords": "Arts, Education, Tony Bevan", "body": "Thurs 26 Oct, 7pm Tony Bevan – In Conversation Marking the launch of the first major monograph in English on his work, Tony Bevan discusses his art & career with Richard Cork.
