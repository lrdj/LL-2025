They took the view that hidden within the myths retold by Homer were truths which, read correctly, would reveal many of the mysteries of the human condition.  The story of the return of Odysseus after the ten year siege of Troy was understood to be a symbolic representation of the struggle the soul has to return to her true home ascending from the ocean of generation to the palace of her ancestors.  The Iliad, on the other hand, was seen as depicting the descent of the soul into the material world full, as it is, with the tensions which accompany such a descent.\r\nThis evening we'll look at the myth which brings about the events that led to the war between the Greeks and the Trojans – the myth of the Judgment of Paris.  When the prince of Troy is asked to pass judgment upon the three Goddesses – Athena, Hera and Aphrodite who are competing for the golden apple – what is he actually choosing between? Can we see a connection between the powers over which the Goddesses preside – wisdom, rulership and desire – and the Platonic tripartite soul? Why does the choice of Aphrodite lead to such a bitter war? \r\nThe evening will begin with a retelling of the myth, a brief summary of the nature of the ancient understanding of the Goddess and the threefold division of the powers of the soul as given in Plato's Republic.

But they are not just dreamers. They have organised, marched on the streets, joined protest camps, opened refuges, logged from war zones, and smashed up military equipment. They have gone undercover, lived in trees, stormed Parliament, and taken on the world's largest corporations. They have been sacked, attacked, psychologically abused, jailed, shot at, sued, deceived by police spies, and even disowned by their families. But still they keep dreaming; still they march on.

Diana Darke became deeply embedded in all levels of Syrian society when she bought and restored a house in Damascus. In September 2012, as fighting intensified, she offered her house as a sanctuary to Syrian friends, up to forty people continue to find refuge there today. By following her experiences and struggles with the realities of life on the ground from the 1970s till the present day, the book provides an eye opening account of why Syria remains locked in conflict.\r\n\r\nThis event accompanies Imagined Futures, the first UK solo show by internationally exhibited Syrian-Armenian artist Hrair Sarkissian, and aims to shed further light on issues raised by the works in the show.\r\n\r\nDiana Darke is an independent author and occasional broadcaster whose work has been published by the BBC, The Guardian, The Financial Times and The Sunday Times. After graduating in Arabic from Oxford, she went on to specialise in the Middle East and Turkey, living and working in a range of Arab countries. She began her career at GCHQ,  then enjoyed spells with various British government departments and commercial companies before turning to full-time writing. Her detailed travel guides to the region are recognized as the leaders in their field.

A gripping, well-balanced, and surprising history.” Douglas Rushkoff, author of Present Shock: When Everything Happens Now\r\n\r\nWe commonly think of the psychedelic ’60s as an explosion of creative energy and freedom that arose in direct revolt against the social restraint and authoritarian hierarchy of the early Cold War years. Yet, as Fred Turner reveals in The Democratic Surround, the decades that brought us the Korean War and communist witch hunts also witnessed an extraordinary turn toward explicitly democratic, open, and inclusive ideas of communication and with them new, flexible models of social order. Surprisingly, he shows that it was this turn that brought us the revolutionary multimedia and the wild-eyed individualism of the 1960s counterculture.\r\n\r\nIn this prequel to his celebrated book From Counterculture to Cyberculture, Turner rewrites the history of postwar America, showing how in the 1940s and ’50s American liberalism offered a far more radical social vision than we now remember. Turner tracks the influential mid-century entwining of Bauhaus aesthetics with American social science and psychology. From the Museum of Modern Art in New York to the New Bauhaus in Chicago and Black Mountain College in North Carolina, Turner shows how some of the most well-known artists and intellectuals of the forties developed new models of media, new theories of interpersonal and international collaboration, and new visions of an open, tolerant, and democratic self in direct contrast to the repression and conformity associated with the fascist and communist movements.\r\n\r\nHe then shows how their work shaped some of the most significant media events of the Cold War, including Edward Steichen’s Family of Man exhibition, the multimedia performances of John Cage, and, ultimately, the psychedelic Be-Ins of the sixties. Turner demonstrates that by the end of the 1950s this vision of the democratic self and the media built to promote it would actually become part of the mainstream, even shaping American propaganda efforts in Europe.", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 2217, "added": "2014-11-11T11:07:08", "slug": "059c5c05101b2fa6", "speakers": [{"id": 15219, "name": "Fred Turner", "slug": "fred-turner"}], "topics": [{"id": 1474, "name": "culture", "path": "/academic/society/culture/culture"}, {"id": 2719, "name": "culture", "path": "/academic/history/gender/culture"}, {"id": 3616, "name": "culture", "path": "/arts/history/worldhistory/culture"}, {"id": 3619, "name": "culture", "path": "/arts/history/culturalhistory/culture"}], "supercategory": "academic", "venue": {"id": 2783, "name": "Housmans Bookshop", "slug": "housmans-bookshop", "city": "London", "postcode": "N1 9DX"}, "organizer": {"id": 2783, "name": "Housmans Bookshop", "slug": "housmans-bookshop"}, "date": "2014-12-19", "dates": [{"id": 14809, "from_date": "2014-12-19", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "19:00:00", "ticket_cost": "Entry £3, redeemable against any purchase", "ticket_info": null, "additional_info": "HOW TO FIND US:\r\nWe're very easy to find - just a two minute walk from King's Cross/St.Pancras terminals.

To provide a comprehensive understanding of the economy it is crucial to recognize that, firstly, the measurement of living standards should be expanded to include consideration of both the costs and benefits of unpaid work and intra-family transfers. Secondly, macroeconomic theory should acknowledge and measure the value of unpaid work as a dimension of output and expand its definitions of investment and consumption. Thirdly, public finance should focus more explicitly on both private and public intergenerational transfers.\r\n\r\nThis lecture applies a feminist perspective on the definition of output, income, and living standards to an alternative framework for national income accounting and budget analysis. This framework disaggregates flows of money and time devoted to the care of children, other dependents, the maintenance of adult capabilities, the development of adult capabilities, and luxury consumption over the lifecycle. By so doing it is possible to recognize the significance of all the work, both paid and unpaid, that contributes to national income.\r\n\r\nNancy Folbre is emeritus professor of economics at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

Questions about the expression of freedom and individuality, that are popularly associated with modern dance, began to take their current form around the beginning of the twentieth century. This was a time when exponents of 'natural dancing' were arguing for a return to nature, while British suffragists were campaigning for the freedom to participate fully in national political life, the militants almost literally throwing their bodies into the fight. In this lecture Professor Burt applies ideas about corporeality, developed by dance scholars, to analyse the treatment of suffragette hunger-strikers. What this reveals about the embodiment of freedom at that time is then used to analyse two contrasting examples: the sometimes conservative values underpinning the development of 'natural dance'; and the radical innovations introduced in Nijinsky's controversial 1913 ballet The Rite of Spring.\r\n\r\nRamsay Burt initially studied Fine Art at Leeds University. While teaching Art History at art colleges, he began writing dance criticism for The Yorkshire Post and for specialist dance magazines. His first book The Male Dancer (1995), based on his PhD thesis, became the standard work on the subject and is still in print. In 1999 he was visiting Professor at New York University, and in 2002, with Professor Susan Foster, he founded the journal Discourses in Dance.

Such plasticity gives us the capacity to remember and learn, and it helps to match our perceptions, thoughts and motor skills to the nature of the world around us.

The story of the Watercube's design can be told as the mathematical history of efficient packing in 2 and 3 dimensions. Lord Kelvin studied soap bubbles and defined the 'Kelvin problem' in 1887: how can space be partitioned into cells of equal volume with the least area of surface between them, i.e., what is the most efficient soap bubble foam? Kelvin's solution consisted of tetrakaidecahedra (with 8 hexagonal and 6 square faces); a model makes it easier for one to be convinced that such shapes do fit together to fill space. For more than 100 years, Kelvin's solution was believed to be the most efficient foam structure. Then, in 1993, two physicists in Dublin, Denis Weaire and Robert Phelan, used computer-based search to, surprisingly, identify a more efficient structure. This uses two kinds of irregular polyhedral cells, and models are even more necessary to enable one to see how they squeeze up to one another to fill space. Ten years later, a team of architects and structural engineers were looking for a design idea for the Olympic Aquatics Centre which would portray the theme of water and also symbolise some Chinese ideal in cultural terms. Make the building square and you have the Chinese ideal of regulated harmony. Arup's designers already knew about using bubbles to form a structural cage for a building; they discovered that the Weaire–Phelan structure could be used as a basis for a structural frame for a cuboidal building, and present an exterior surface which appears organic and 'random' whilst actually being a repeating pattern. A foam structure has many other desirable properties and constructional advantages for architecture.

By return of post came an invitation to tea. What did they talk about at that first meeting, and what advice was Holroyd able to give? Is the art of biography instinctive, or can it be taught? And do biographers find their subjects, or do their subjects come looking for them? Michael Holroyd and Patrick French consider these, and other biographical conundrums, in a discussion chaired by Anne Chisholm.\r\n\r\nSince the publication of his two-volume biography of Lytton Strachey in 1967 and 1968, Michael Holroyd has been widely regarded as one of the most innovative and influential of contemporary biographers. His other subjects include Augustus John, Bernard Shaw, and himself. Most recently, he published A Strange Eventful History: The Dramatic Lives of Ellen Terry, Henry Irving and Their Remarkable Families, described by John Carey in the Sunday Times as ‘a fabulous cavalcade of a book, written with infectious verve and deep imaginative sympathy’. He is also a formidable campaigner on behalf of literature and writers, and is president of the Royal Society of Literature. In 2007 was knighted for his services to literature.\r\n\r\nPatrick French’s first book, a biography of Francis Younghusband (1994), won both the Somerset Maugham Award and the Royal Society of Literature Heinemann Award. This was followed by Liberty or Death: India’s Journey to Independence and Division, which won him the Sunday Times Young Writer of the Year Award. In March 2008, he published The World Is What It Is, the authorized biography of Nobel Prize Winner V.S. Naipaul. Described by Michael Holroyd as ‘the boldest biographical enterprise of recent times’, it was selected as one of the ten best books of 2008 by the New York Times and the Washington Post. It will come out in paperback in April.\r\n\r\nAnne Chisholm, chair of the Royal Society of Literature, is a biographer and critic who has also worked in publishing and journalism (she began her working life on Private Eye). Her first biography, Nancy Cunard (1979), won the Silver PEN Prize for non-fiction, and in 1992 her biography of Lord Beaverbrook, which she wrote jointly with her husband, Michael Davie, was runner up for the Hawthornden Prize. She has also written a life of Rumer Godden, and a study of the female survivors of Hiroshima. In April, Weidenfeld and Nicolson will publish her authorized biography of the Bloomsbury diarist Frances Partridge.\r\n\r\nThis event is supported by the Royal Society of Literature.

The main purpose of this presentation is to explore what meanings have been attached to these two essentially contested terms and to assess the extent to which this work constitutes an important, coherent, and cumulative body of scholarship. The first half will explore the existing literatures on the two terms and draw out some of the main similarities and differences. Drawing on a recently edited collection of chapters in Adger, W.N. and A.J. Jordan (eds) (2008) Governing Sustainability (Cambridge University Press), the second half will focus on the attempts that have been made to build empirical and/or theoretical bridges between the two terms. The concluding part will identify a number of key themes and explore future research needs in what is evidently a vibrant and highly policy-relevant area of environmental social science research.\r\n\r\nAndrew Jordan is Professor in Environmental Politics at the RAE 5** School of Environmental Sciences at the University of East Anglia in Norwich.

But Philip Ball argues that, not only is chemistry often neglected in these surveys, but it has its own special kinds of beauty, linked to the fact that it is a branch of science strongly tied to the art of making things: new molecules and materials, new smells and colours. He offers suggestions for ten particularly beautiful experiments in chemistry, taken from his recent book Elegant solutions. \r\n\r\nThis talk marks the book's receipt of the 2007 Dingle Prize for communicating the history of science and technology from the British Society for the History of Science. \r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": null, "added": "2008-04-18T03:37:00", "slug": "elegant-solutions", "speakers": [{"id": 6774, "name": "Dr Phil Ball", "slug": "dr-phil-ball"}], "topics": [{"id": 143, "name": "chemistry", "path": "/science/chemistry"}], "supercategory": "science", "venue": {"id": 1382, "name": "Royal Institution", "slug": "royal-institution", "city": "London", "postcode": "W1S 4BS"}, "organizer": {"id": 1382, "name": "Royal Institution", "slug": "royal-institution"}, "date": "2008-07-10", "dates": [{"id": 5624, "from_date": "2008-07-10", "to_date": "2008-07-10", "time": "19:00:00", "ticket_cost": "Tickets cost £8, £6 concessions and £4 for RI Members", "ticket_info": "Book tickets at www.rigb.org or call 020 7409 2992", "additional_info": null, "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 1382, "name": "Royal Institution", "slug": "royal-institution", "city": "London", "postcode": "W1S 4BS"}, "organizer": {"id": 1382, "name": "Royal Institution", "slug": "royal-institution"}}]}, {"id": 5236, "title": "Punk Science: Know it all?", "synopsis": "A fusion of science, comedy, music, experiments, and voting.
