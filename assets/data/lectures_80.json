This is not feminist science – it’s just science.", "keywords": "gender, sexism, feminism, equality, neuroscience", "body": "Reading maps or reading emotions? Barbie or Lego? We live in a gendered world where we are bombarded with messages about sex and gender. The twenty-first century world is one which seems determined to magnify ‘essential’ differences between men and women’s brains, from (or even before) the moment of birth. This comes via clothes, books, through schools, the workplace and the influence of social media.\r\n\r\nWhere do these supposed differences come from and how ‘essential’ are they?\r\n\r\nTaking us back through centuries of sexism in science, The Gendered Brain shows how we arrived at the idea of an inferior, female brain and how cutting-edge breakthroughs in neuroscience can liberate us from this outdated understanding of what our brains can do. Gina Rippon shows us the reality behind much of the data that is used to justify the gender gap, and explains how major breakthroughs in neuroscience will help us dispel these stereotypes and ‘neurotrash’.\r\n\r\nGina Rippon is the author of The Gendered Brain: an accessible and polemic popular science book with huge repercussions for the gender debate, for education, for parenting and for how we identify ourselves.

Inspired by Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg's likeable bestseller Lean In, it's much more than just a riposte to the popular business manifesto for women. Fascinating, thought-provoking and at times outrage-inducing, Lean Out elucidates the many ways in which women are being subjugated by corporations and the government, and encourages us to take direct action to address these inequalities.\r\n\r\nSheryl Sandberg’s business advice book, Lean In, was heralded as a defining moment in attitudes to women in business. But for all its commercial success, it proposed a model of feminism that was individualistic and unthreatening to capital.\r\n\r\nIn her powerful debut work Lean Out, acclaimed journalist Dawn Foster unpicks how the purportedly feminist message of Sandberg’s book neatly exempts patriarchy, capitalism and business from any responsibility for changing the position of women in contemporary culture. It looks at the rise of a corporate ‘1% feminism’, and at how feminism has been defanged and depoliticised at a time when women have borne the brunt of the financial crash and the gap between rich and poor is widening faster than ever.\r\n\r\nSurveying business, media, culture and politics, Foster asks whether this ‘trickledown’ feminism offers any material gain for women collectively, or acts as mere window-dressing PR for the corporations who caused the financial crash. She concludes that ‘leaning out’ of the corporate model is a more effective way of securing change than leaning in.\r\n\r\nDawn Foster is a writer on politics, social affairs and economics for The Guardian, London Review of Books, Independent and Times Literary Supplement, and is a regular political commentator for Sky News, Channel 4 News, and BBC Newsnight.

It doesn’t have to be this way!\r\n\r\nThe Vegan Book of Permaculture gives us the tools and confidence to take responsibility for our lives and actions. Creating a good meal, either for ourselves or to share, taking time to prepare fresh, wholesome home or locally grown ingredients with care and respect can be a deeply liberating experience. It is also a way of taking back some control from the advertising agencies and multinational corporations.\r\n\r\nIn this groundbreaking and original book, Graham demonstrates how understanding universal patterns and principles, and applying these to our own gardens and lives, can make a very real difference to both our personal lives and the health of our planet. This also isn’t so very different from the compassionate concern for ‘Animals, People and Environment’ of the vegan way.\r\n\r\nInterspersed with an abundance of delicious, healthy and wholesome exploitation-free recipes, Graham provides solutions-based approaches to nurturing personal effectiveness and health, eco-friendly living, home and garden design, veganic food growing, reafforestation strategies, forest gardening, reconnection with wild nature and community regeneration with plenty of practical ways to be well fed with not an animal dead! This is vegan living at its best.\r\n\r\nAbout The Author\r\n\r\n\r\nGraham Burnett has been a vegan since 1984 and has been active in the permaculture movement since 1995.

We have begun to learn that many accepted mutations are selectively neutral but others appear to be selectively advantageous to the organism by optimising stability, activity and interactions at the molecular and cellular levels. More recently second generation methods of gene sequencing are allowing us to follow the evolution and emergence of resistance as tumours escape the restraints of tissue function and as pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and HIV evade the immune response of the host.  To understand this is essential to the design of new medicines. I will discuss work in my laboratory funded by the Wellcome Trust on cancer and by the Gates Foundation on tuberculosis.

It's a love that is unshakable, unmoving, and indestructible. Such love - a love that transcends yet simultaneously embraces the world - is what compels human beings to evolve, from their own deepest depths, and to become better citizens of our world and our cosmos. Knowing the mysterious source of that love is knowing before thought that life is good. That inherent goodness is who we really are.\"\r\n\r\n- Andrew Cohen\r\n\r\n \r\nIn tonight's talk Andrew Cohen will outline how to develop Spiritual Self-Confidence as a source of deep inspiration, which when cultivated can become a powerful ground for real evolutionary transformation. This unique and palpable sense of conviction cannot be shaken by fear or doubt within yourself, or from anyone around you. This confidence can only be found through awakening to who you are and why you are here at the deepest level of your being.\r\n\r\nFor twenty-five years, Andrew Cohen has been developing a new path for spiritual awakening and has tailored it specifically for contemporary individuals who care passionately about creating a better world. Change, as we all know, can often be quite challenging.

Greece is on the verge of default. In Britain, the coalition government is pushing through an austerity programme in the face of economic weakness. The US government almost shut down in August because of a dispute over the size of government debt. \r\n\r\nOur latest crisis may seem to have started in 2007, with the collapse of the American housing market. But as Philip Coggan shows in this new book, Paper Promises: Money, Debt and the new World Order which he will talk about in this lecture, the crisis is part of an age-old battle between creditors and borrowers. And that battle has been fought over the nature of money. Creditors always want sound money to ensure that they are paid back in full; borrowers want easy money to reduce the burden of repaying their debts. Money was once linked to gold, a commodity in limited supply; now central banks can create it with the click of a computer mouse. \r\n\r\nTime and again, this cycle has resulted in financial and economic crises. In the 1930s, countries abandoned the gold standard in the face of the Great Depression. In the 1970s, they abandoned the system of fixed exchange rates and ushered in a period of paper money. The results have been a long series of asset bubbles, from dotcom stocks to housing, and the elevation of the financial sector to economic dominance. \r\n\r\nThe current crisis not only pits creditors against debtors, but taxpayers against public sector workers, young against old and the western world against Asia. As in the 1930s and 1970s, a new monetary system will emerge; the rules for which will likely be set by the world's rising economic power, China. \r\n\r\nPhilip Coggan was a Financial Times journalist for over twenty years, including spells as a Lex columnist, personal finance editor and investment editor, and is now the Buttonwood columnist of The Economist. In 2009, he was awarded the title of Senior Financial Journalist in the Harold Wincott awards and was voted Best Communicator at the Business Journalist of the Year Awards. Philip Coggan is the author of the business classic, The Money Machine. \r\n\r\nSuggested hashtag for this event for Twitter users: #lsedebt \r\n\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 732, "added": "2011-12-07T08:04:10", "slug": "paper-promises-money-debt-and-the-new-world-order", "speakers": [{"id": 11170, "name": "Panellist:  Philip  Coggan", "slug": "panellist-philip-coggan"}, {"id": 8924, "name": "Dr  Paul Woolley", "slug": "dr-paul-woolley"}], "topics": [{"id": 2251, "name": "economy", "path": "/academic/history/usa/coldwar/economy"}, {"id": 1649, "name": "policy", "path": "/politics/environment/environment/policy"}, {"id": 1640, "name": "economy", "path": "/society/media/news/economy"}, {"id": 458, "name": "policy", "path": "/politics/europe/policy"}], "supercategory": "academic", "venue": {"id": 1287, "name": "London School of Economics & Political Science", "slug": "london-school-of-economics-political-science", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC2A 2AE"}, "organizer": {"id": 1287, "name": "London School of Economics & Political Science", "slug": "london-school-of-economics-political-science"}, "date": "2012-01-19", "dates": [{"id": 10869, "from_date": "2012-01-19", "to_date": "2012-01-19", "time": "18:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": "This event is free and open to all with no ticket required.

Climate change and its expected consequences for the planet conjure up images of glacial melting and polar bears sitting on ridiculously small icebergs. Yet scientific projections unequivocally indicate that Africa will be hit hardest by the impacts of climate change as compared with other continents. For Africans, climate change is expected to bring greater incidence of disease, reduced crop production, and increased occurrence of extreme weather that could worsen droughts and flooding. Other risks of climate change in Africa include rising sea levels, greater water stress and famine, loss of species, and increased conflicts and wars. This meeting will aim to review the different challenges posed by climate change in Africa (e.g. environmental, ecological, societal, economical).

Over the last 25 years he has revitalised the human image in sculpture through a radical investigation of the body as a place of memory and transformation, using his own body as subject, tool and material. Since 1990 he has expanded his concern with the human condition to explore the collective body and the relationship between self and other in large-scale installations like Allotment, Critical Mass, Another Place, Domain Field, and Inside Australia. His recent work increasingly engages with energy systems, fields and vectors, rather than mass and defined volume, evident in works like Clearing, Blind Light, Firmament and Another Singularity. Antony Gormley’s work has been exhibited extensively, with solo shows throughout the UK in venues such as the Whitechapel, Tate and the Hayward Galleries, the British Museum and White Cube.  He was awarded the Turner Prize in 1994 and the South Bank Prize for Visual Art in 1999 and was made an Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1997. In 2007 he was awarded the Bernhard Heiliger Award for Sculpture. He is an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects, Trinity College, Cambridge and Jesus College, Cambridge, and has been a Royal Academician since 2003.\r\n\r\nRichard Sennett was born in Chicago in 1943. He grew up in the Cabrini Green Housing Project, one of the first racially-mixed public housing projects in the United States. At the age of six he began to study the piano and the cello, eventually working with Frank Miller of the Chicago Symphony and Claus Adam of the Julliard Quartet. Mr. Sennett was one of the last students of the conductor Pierre Monteux. In 1963 a hand injury put a sudden end to his musical career; for better or worse he then embarked on academic study.   Professor Sennett trained at the University of Chicago and at Harvard University, receiving his Ph.D. in 1969. He then moved to New York where, in the 1970s he founded, with Susan Sontag and Joseph Brodsky, The New York Institute for the Humanities at New York University. In the 1980s he served as an advisor to UNESCO and as president of the American Council on Work; he also taught occasionally at Harvard. Richard Sennett is currently centennial professor of Sociology at LSE and Bemis professor of Social Sciences at MIT.  Professor Sennett's first book, The Uses of Disorder [1970] looked at how personal identity takes form in the modern city, his latest The Craftsmen [2008] explores the values of good craftsmanship in society today.\r\n\r\nNeven Sidor is a partner in Grimshaw Architects, who designed LSE's New Academic Building.  He studied architecture at Nottingham University, qualifying in 1977.  He joined Grimshaw Architects in 1981.  He devotes the bulk of his time to design and believes in the spirit of exploration; to follow a chain of rational decisions and see where that leads you in terms of design.  Faithful adherence to practical steps combined with the confidence to embrace the unknown can lead to surprising and distinctive results.  Neven leads all competition work, recently winning two London university projects and continually driving Grimshaw to explore new areas and territories.  In London, Neven directed the International Terminal at Waterloo and Sainsbury's supermarket in Camden Town.

As a result of this process, the exercise of authority is now carried out increasingly at trans-, inter-, and supra-national levels. This poses a fundamental question for political thought. Do the new circumstances in which states operate require a reassessment of our understanding of distributive justice? In this series of talks, Andrea Sangiovanni will argue for three interconnected claims. First, that facts about political and social institutions should affect not only the implementation of principles of justice but also, and more controversially, their content, scope, and grounds. Second, that equality as a demand of justice only applies among citizens and residents of a state. This is not because citizens and residents share a collective identity, or because they are subject to the same coercive power, but because they share in the mutual provision of the collective goods necessary for a flourishing life. Equality is therefore best understood as a demand of reciprocity. Third, this reciprocity-based conception of distributive justice can be extended to the inter-, trans-, and supra-national level.

He was acclaimed emperor by his troops in York on the death of his father in 306. His father's main residence had been at Trier and Constantine must have spent much time there both during and after his father's life, before he crossed the Alps with an army in 312 eventually to defeat his western rival outside Rome at the \"Battle of the Milvian Bridge\". It was in 313 that he met with his ally in the East, Licinius, in Milan. Constantinople was founded in 324 and dedicated in 330. The first ecumenical council was held at Nicaea (Iznik as now) in 325. Constantine's mother, Helena, visited the Holy Land in 326/7.

This makes stroke the most common cause of disability, and within the next few decades it will become the most common cause of death worldwide. The good news is that prevention is crucial and that stroke is very preventable. We are increasingly able to identify individuals at very high risk and target preventive treatment accordingly – ‘personalised medicine’ really is possible in some situations. Join Charles and Peter as they define the problem and explore some of the ways in which we might prevent the impending epidemic, with up-to the minute information on prevention and current/future treatments. What happens to the body during and after a stroke? Are there warning signs, and what should we look for? What are the causes of stroke, how common is it and how can we reduce the massive burden to individuals and to society? This event will be chaired by Avril Mansfield, Chairman of Council at the Stroke Association.\r\n\r\nPeter Rothwell is Professor of Clinical Neurology and Director of the Stroke Prevention Research Unit at the University of Oxford. His main research interests are the causes and prevention of stroke and the effective application of the results of research to the management of patients in routine clinical practice.\r\n\r\nCharles Wolfe is Professor of Public Health at King’s College London. He heads a multidisciplinary stroke team addressing the impact of stroke in a multiethnic south London community and international projects assessing the quality of stroke care.
