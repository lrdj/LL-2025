While this phase of the research shed light on the structural aspects of the Holocaust—and especially how the Holocaust was organized and carried out spatially—they realized that a quantitative approach tends to favour the perspective of the perpetrator.\r\n\r\nFor an integrated history of the Holocaust, it is essential to insert the perspective of the victim through the study of survivors’ testimonies. Mirroring the organization of the first phase of their research, they are tackling this issue simultaneously at a variety of scales, through both a close reading of individual testimonies and the use of corpus linguistics, social network analysis, and other techniques to scale up from one testimony to hundreds and thousands of narratives. Thus, thus aim at an integrated geography of the Holocaust as well as an integrated history of the event.\r\n\r\nIn this lecture, Cole and Giordano will make the case for such an approach through the combination of a spatial approach to the study of the Holocaust with one that is explicitly based on the construction of the places of the Holocaust by victims, bystanders, and perpetrators.\r\n\r\nChaired by: Prof Marilyn Deegan, Professor of Digital Humanities and Honorary Research Fellow, King’s College London.", "additional_info": null, "duration": 120, "image_id": null, "added": "2018-08-02T10:11:09", "slug": "78fa2b9e5ba39810", "speakers": [{"id": 16700, "name": "Professor Tim  Cole", "slug": "professor-tim-cole"}, {"id": 16839, "name": "Prof Alberto Giordano", "slug": "prof-alberto-giordano"}], "topics": [{"id": 107, "name": "wwii", "path": "/arts/books/history/military/wwii"}, {"id": 2692, "name": "history", "path": "/arts/finearts/film/film/history"}, {"id": 106, "name": "wwi", "path": "/arts/books/history/military/wwi"}, {"id": 108, "name": "army", "path": "/arts/books/history/military/army"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 1886, "name": "The Wiener Library for the Study of the Holocaust and Genocide", "slug": "the-wiener-library-for-the-study-of-the-holocaust-and-genocide", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC1B 5DP"}, "organizer": {"id": 1886, "name": "The Wiener Library for the Study of the Holocaust and Genocide", "slug": "the-wiener-library-for-the-study-of-the-holocaust-and-genocide"}, "date": "2018-09-04", "dates": [{"id": 16782, "from_date": "2018-09-04", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "18:00:00", "ticket_cost": "Free, registration essential", "ticket_info": "https://www.wienerlibrary.co.uk/Whats-On?item=403", "additional_info": "An accessible toilet is available in the basement and can be reached via the lift.\r\nFor visitors with hearing impairment, an induction loop in the exhibition area and the Wolfson Reading Room is compatible with T-coil equipped hearing aids.\r\nWe welcome Guide and Assistance dogs in the exhibition area and the Wolfson Reading Room.\r\nIf you have any comments, questions, or concerns regarding accessibility at the Library, please email us at info@wienerlibrary.co.uk or call us at +44 (0) 20 7636 7247.", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 1886, "name": "The Wiener Library for the Study of the Holocaust and Genocide", "slug": "the-wiener-library-for-the-study-of-the-holocaust-and-genocide", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC1B 5DP"}, "organizer": {"id": 1886, "name": "The Wiener Library for the Study of the Holocaust and Genocide", "slug": "the-wiener-library-for-the-study-of-the-holocaust-and-genocide"}}]}, {"id": 16179, "title": "Myths About the Morgans of Tredegar House", "synopsis": "Myths About The Morgans of Tredegar House, Newport, South Wales, Busting the History Fraudsters", "keywords": "Tredegar House", "body": "Among the myths about the Morgans of Tredegar House is that they are descended from the Welsh Princes.\r\n\r\nSome also claim they have a family link to the notorious Captain Henry Morgan, the blood thirsty pirate of the Caribbean.

First, nursing academics do not significantly undertake research and second, despite several strong journals such as Nurse Education Today and Journal of Nursing Education devoted to the topic, nursing education in the classroom or practice setting is not significantly underpinned by educational research.\r\n\r\nIn this inaugural lecture Professor Roberts will explore the relationship between teaching and research, looking at how the profession can practise what it preaches and move towards a research agenda. She will consider the role of the nursing teacher, in particular their ability to ensure that students can identify the scientific source of their nursing knowledge, and the extent to which they can articulate the research underpinning the methods they use in teaching and creating learning opportunities.\r\n\r\nProfessor Roberts will conclude the lecture with a discussion of the current developments and research strands being undertaken at Glyndwr University to establish the evidence base underpinning nurse education.\r\n\r\nOriginally from Essex, Professor Roberts has lived in Wrexham for over twenty five years. A graduate of NEWI in 1998, she joined the University of Salford as a lecturer in 2000, achieving a PhD in 2007. She is a Registered Nurse Teacher and Fellow of the Higher Education Academy, and is Associate Editor of the international peer reviewed journal Nurse Education in Practice. Debbie joined Glyndwr University in 2012 as a Reader with a track record of bridging the teaching research nexus; something she is keen to continue to develop further.\r\n\r\nDebbie is Director of the University Research Centre for Psychology, Sport Science and Health. Her research focuses on two complimentary areas: scholarly work exploring the pedagogy of nursing and healthcare professions; and clinically driven work. She has undertaken creative and innovative interdisciplinary work, exploring links between learning to act and learning to be a nurse, and suggesting how nurse educators could learn from the performing arts in matters of assessment.\r\n\r\nOur Inaugural and Professorial Lectures are open to all and free to attend.

The Prince’s family scoffed at Rosemary’s chequered family pedigree and dismissed the love-weary Prince’s designs, leaving Rosemary, a heroic Red Cross nurse during the Great War, to be swept into marriage by Eric, Viscount Ednam, a close friend of Edward, and heir to an ancient English Earldom. The Ednams became a dynamic couple of the Bright Young Things era of the 1920s, but in July, 1930 at the peak of their chaotic life together, Rosemary met her sudden death in a horrific aeroplane crash, which also killed three of her fellow aristocrats. The unexplained accident (which remains unsolved even today) caused giant ripples across the whole of British Society. Rumours were rife of sabotage, especially as it was said that Edward, Prince of Wales, had only just escaped death in the same crash by changing his travel plans at the last minute. Will Cross (author of several biographies on the British gentry) unravels Rosemary’s life and times and offers some startling and sinister facts about the aftermath of her tragic death. An illustrated talk. Will Cross is working on a book about Rosemary and her brother Alistair ( who also died mysteriously). Both Rosemary and Alastair Leveson-Gower were friends of Gwyneth Morgan, the wayward daughter of Courtenay, Lord Tredegar.

Or might an over-reliance on standardised testing principles lead to a reductive style of examining which is in conflict with the UK’s tradition?\r\n\r\nThis seminar is part of the Assessment Principles series of seminars presented by Andrew Watts, a Principal Consultant for the Cambridge Assessment Network Division. The series focuses on five key topics in assessment: the purposes of assessment; the relationship between assessment and learning; the development of assessments; the validity and the reliability of assessments. Each session addresses one of these topics. Though the topics are the same each year, up-to-date issues are discussed which focus on recent news stories or which represent the latest thinking in that area. The series is for those who want to take a broad view of the field of educational assessment, in company with others working in the field. Participants will be able to share their own experiences and perceptions, and to reflect on those of others. A certificate is awarded for attendance at all five sessions (contact the Network team for details).\r\n\r\nDates for 2012 are:\r\n\r\n8 March: What is the purpose of public assessments (Cambridge)\r\n12 April: What is the purpose of public assessments (Coventry)\r\n10 May: How can assessment support learning?

", "keywords": "manufacture, rapid, laser, additive manufacture", "body": "When the first Stereolithography machine was presented to the world 20 years ago the idea that objects of unlimited complexity could be “grown” in layers by shining a laser into a vat of resin seemed absurd.  However, there are now over 30 commercial Additive Manufacturing (AM) methods, with many more under development.  Moreover, applications are no longer confined to the production of engineering prototypes.  AM is being used within the creative industries sector to make customised jewellery, sculptures and even footwear.  Anatomical models and patient specific implants can be produced from medical scan data, simplifying complex surgery procedures.  In architecture AM has metamorphosed from a method of making scale models to a new way of constructing buildings themselves.\r\n\r\nThis lecture will show that the roots of AM actually lie in the dawn of civilisation and how a chance combination of material, lasers and computer development enabled AM in its modern form to be born. The key innovations, which have enabled AM to grow into  an industrial sector worth in excess of £1bm, will be reviewed.  Finally the presentation will conclude with a prediction of what the next 20 years may hold for this revolutionary approach to manufacturing.\r\n\r\nProfessor Wimpenny is one of the World’s leading experts in the field of Additive Manufacturing. His groundbreaking work at Warwick University and DeMontfort University (since 2001) has paved the way for the use of AM in the production of end use parts. He has published over 70 research papers and is a Fellow of the Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining and an active member of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers. \r\n\r\nPlease book online or contact our Events Office on (0116) 257 7452 or eventsoffice@dmu.ac.uk", "additional_info": null, "duration": 60, "image_id": null, "added": "2010-12-14T20:46:26", "slug": "411f43cd23341ea9", "speakers": [{"id": 10576, "name": "Professor David  Wimpenny", "slug": "professor-david-wimpenny"}], "topics": [{"id": 2347, "name": "additivemanufacturing", "path": "/academic/manufacturing/additivemanufacturing"}, {"id": 2346, "name": "manufacturing", "path": "/academic/manufacturing"}], "supercategory": "academic", "venue": {"id": 2358, "name": "Hugh Aston Building", "slug": "hugh-aston-building", "city": "Leicester", "postcode": "LE1 9BH"}, "organizer": {"id": 1717, "name": "Professorial Lecture Series", "slug": "professorial-lecture-series"}, "date": "2011-05-12", "dates": [{"id": 9540, "from_date": "2011-05-12", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "18:00:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": "To book a place or for more information please email Daniel Jones at djones@dmu.ac.uk or telephone 0116 257 7452", "additional_info": "Places must be booked in advance as there are limited places.

Illusions demonstrate that context is everything when it comes to our perceived reality, that our mental constructs are not accurate representations of the world, but useful interpretations of a world. Illusions show us that the mind is an evolved machine that constantly redefines normality, an organic network that creates, that finds useful relationships and patterns, patterns that are then used to guide behaviour. Illusions show us that what we see is necessarily relative to a normal grounded in history, and thus a normal that each of us can control. Thus, illusions ultimately tell us who we are as individuals: undefined by the bits that make us up, defined instead by our interactions. Through these interactions we create and re-create our personal perceptions and conceptions of reality. This is exciting and important stuff, which unfortunately is lost on too many who chose to place themselves in environments of low variability, of un-adaptable norms. Here, I will tell an untypical story of illusions. Along the way, we'll experience the sky in the bottle and the red of a setting sun. We'll hear the music of light, and see the world as an insect might see it. Indeed, we'll see bees solving puzzles that even our most sophisticated computers can't solve. We'll see first hand the brain seeing a new normal. Though grounded in science of illusions, the subtext of this interactive 'lecture' will be to use illusion as a metaphor for understanding, indeed learning empathy.\r\n\r\n\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 60, "image_id": null, "added": "2007-04-17T19:07:41", "slug": "re-defining-normality", "speakers": [{"id": 5285, "name": "Dr Beau Lotto", "slug": "dr-beau-lotto"}], "topics": [{"id": 608, "name": "contemporary", "path": "/arts/literature/francophone/poetry/contemporary"}, {"id": 612, "name": "contemporary", "path": "/arts/books/poetry/french/contemporary"}, {"id": 170, "name": "newtopic", "path": "/science/chemistry/biochemistry/catalysis/newtopic"}, {"id": 910, "name": "science", "path": "/arts/film/documentary/science"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 1185, "name": "Louise T Blouin Institute", "slug": "louise-t-blouin-institute", "city": "London", "postcode": "W11 4BE"}, "organizer": {"id": 1185, "name": "Louise T Blouin Institute", "slug": "louise-t-blouin-institute"}, "date": "2007-05-08", "dates": [{"id": 4370, "from_date": "2007-05-08", "to_date": "2007-05-08", "time": "18:30:00", "ticket_cost": "£5 or free for concessions/members", "ticket_info": "The Institute.

They will jointly present the case for rewilding, but will review the established difficulties in achieving this.   \r\n\r\nTony Aykroyd will review the great opportunities that are now emerging for restoration of very large natural habitat areas.  Falling subsidies resulting from ongoing CAP reform and problems with the forestry sector point to diminishing financial viability of traditional land use in many marginal areas.  Equally, there is growing appreciation of the benefits of natural \"wildlands\" - for local communities and landholders as well as conservation interests.  Climate change, nature-tourism and the growth of new markets in healthcare, youth at risk and education all offer opportunities for direct income, as well as funding support for wildland environmental and social \"services\".  Many excellent restoration initiatives are underway in individual locations, but there is now potential to develop these into a linked network on a much bigger scale - matching rural opportunity with urban need and engaging a higher level of political support in the process. \r\n\r\nJonathan Spencer will contrast the radical ideas of Toby Aykroyd with a more establishment approach to what is practicably possible, given relevant potential and constraints.  He will draw out the issues and opportunities that lie out there, and explore some of the examples of restoration.\r\n\r\nToby Aykroyd studied macroeconomics, geography and development economics at Cambridge University and has an MBA from the Cranfield Institute of Technology.  He was initially posted to the UN Development Programme in Central America where he worked on agricultural and SME business projects.  His career since has mainly included commercial management both in the private sector and under contract to government.  He has been involved in farming and forestry enterprises, directed a political lobby group and co-founded the Small Firms Enterprise Development Initiative.\r\nThe Wild Britain Initiative which he coordinates seeks to promote the restoration of large-scale natural habitat areas across 2 million acres in the UK over the next 25 years: making use of economic, social and political as well as conservation opportunities.  He is Co-Chairman of the Population & Sustainability Network and Vice-Chairman of the Wilderness Foundation.\r\n\r\nJonathan Spencer is the Senior Ecologist for the Forestry Commission in England.  Having studied botany and zoology at Nottingham he worked as research assistant in the Genetics Department of Cambridge University before embarking on a career in woodland conservation with the Nature Conservancy Council in 1981, working to George Peterken and Keith Kirby.  After many years of compiling the NCC Ancient Woodland Inventory, he moved to Regional duties as Conservation Officer for Buckinghamshire, though with woodland work continuing across the country in the form of various projects.  His chief accomplishment in this time was the restoration of Greenham Common Airbase to wildlife habitat and commonland.  A secondment to the FC in the New Forest matured into a permanent appointment as senior ecologist FC England, where he continues to work.  With 268,000ha of land under its direct control and with forest and woodland creation and management policy and support across the rest of the country as key parts of the FC's role, the post continues to provide challenge and interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 120, "image_id": null, "added": "2006-08-18T12:01:52", "slug": "rewilding-the-vision-examples-constraints-and-benefits", "speakers": [{"id": 4260, "name": "Toby Aykroyd", "slug": "toby-aykroyd"}, {"id": 4261, "name": "Jonathan Spencer", "slug": "jonathan-spencer"}], "topics": [{"id": 427, "name": "ecology", "path": "/arts/architecture/ecology"}, {"id": 868, "name": "climate", "path": "/science/climatechange/climate"}, {"id": 752, "name": "conservation", "path": "/science/naturalhistory/conservation"}, {"id": 924, "name": "conservation", "path": "/academic/naturalhistory/conservation"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 1089, "name": "Birkbeck, University of London", "slug": "birkbeck-university-of-london", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC1E 7HX"}, "organizer": {"id": 1069, "name": "Ecology and Conservation Studies Society", "slug": "ecology-and-conservation-studies-society"}, "date": "2006-10-27", "dates": [{"id": 3472, "from_date": "2006-10-27", "to_date": "2006-10-27", "time": "18:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": null, "additional_info": "For any queries, please contact e-mail:   wright@britishlibrary.net;  tel:  020 7485 7903,\r\n   or contact e-mail:   a.inniss@bbk.ac.uk;  tel:  020 7679 1069\r\n", "members_only": "No", "members_info": "Details of the Society and application forms will be available at the door, and are on our website http://www.bbk.ac.uk/ce/environment/ecssociety/index.shtml", "venue": {"id": 1089, "name": "Birkbeck, University of London", "slug": "birkbeck-university-of-london", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC1E 7HX"}, "organizer": {"id": 1069, "name": "Ecology and Conservation Studies Society", "slug": "ecology-and-conservation-studies-society"}}]}, {"id": 3284, "title": "Unlocking the Nation's Art Treasures", "synopsis": "Outstanding yet unknown art collection", "keywords": "art history", "body": "From portraits to seascapes, this significant collection includes work by Turner, Reynolds, Canaletto, Gainsborough and Hogarth.
