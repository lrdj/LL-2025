Room V105, Vine building, Middlesex University, London, NW4 4BT\r\n\r\nCrime fiction is typically regarded as cheap and disposable and certainly not conducive to serious archival scholarship. In this talk, I consider what the “official” archive held by the University of South Carolina reveals about Dashiell Hammett, a figure about which much is already known. The real “discovery” is not Hammett himself, for there is little that the archive can now tell us beyond what is already known, but the lives and dramas of those who first tried to excavate Hammett’s story in the late 1960s and 1970s. This talk examines how biographical scholarship was conducted in the pre-digital era and what was at stake for those who sought, against the wishes of Hammett’s estate, to dig up the buried details of his life and works. Its focus is not Hammett himself but the freewheeling band of “unauthorized” Hammett hunters who toiled away in the early 1970s and whose efforts typically, and in typically Hammettian fashion, ended in failure.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBIO:\r\n\r\npepperAndrew Pepper is Senior Lecturer in English at Queen’s University Belfast.

Many were imprisoned for their beliefs, subject to threats of execution and to torture. Over 100 would die as a result of their objection. After the war they were often shunned and their experiences untold, but their contribution to the causes of human rights and prison reform as well as their tireless campaign for peaceful solutions to world problems ensures they are an important part of 20th century history.\r\n\r\n‘Objecting to War’ focuses on unearthing the lives and stories of these conscientious objectors in the Greater London area.  Each individual had their own reasons and motivations for refusing conscription and the Peace Pledge Union wants to discover what those were. Was it for religious reasons? Was it for political beliefs? What happened to them, during and after the war?

Academic shackles were cast off, fresh ideas about naturalism were explored and the hitherto-neglected world of early Renaissance art became a fertile source for style, subject and motif. To reflect the “Pre-Raphaelites: Victorian Avant-Garde” exhibition at Tate Britain, this study day will provide a chance to explore just how modern the Pre-Raphaelites really were. No revolution is sparked from nothing, so what was really happening within Victorian culture to allow their controversial methods of practice to take root, develop and affect public taste? We will look at Holman Hunt’s idiosyncratic use of symbolism, Rossetti’s fraught relationship with the art of the past, Millais’ apparent (but stylistically complex) betrayal of the group’s principles and Burne-Jones’ capacity to fuse romantic themes with a near-abstract sense of design. If you’ve ever wondered what Pre-Raphaelitism really means – the term, the style, the influence – this study day will address these issues while also discussing the continuing appeal of the movement.

His column, \"The Undercover Economist\", which reveals the economic ideas behind everyday experiences, is published in the Financial Times and syndicated around the world.

His second book, The Logic of Life, was published early in 2008 in English, and has also been widely translated, and his third book, Dear Undercover Economist is a collection of his \"Dear Economist\" columns. \r\n\r\nHe presented the BBC television series \"Trust Me, I'm an Economist\" and now presents the BBC radio series \"More or Less\".

He has been published by the leading magazines and newspapers on both sides of the Atlantic, including Esquire, Forbes, Wired, New York Magazine, the Guardian, the London Times, the Washington Post and the New York Times. \r\n\r\nTim and the team from More or Less won the Royal Statistical Society's 2010 award for statistical excellence in broadcast journalism and the 2010 Mensa Intelligence award. In 2011 Tim was named one of the UK's top 20 most influential tweeters by The Independent newspaper. Tim also won the 2006 Bastiat Prize for economic journalism.

Once taken out of its biomedical straightjacket, however, dementia emerges as a condition which has much in common with the conscious projects of surrealist and situationist arts movements.  This includes the subversion of the idea of time as a linear, uni-directional process. People diagnosed with dementia often state a desire to return to places from the past which no longer exist in physical space, but which remain real as remembered worlds, and sources of nostalgia (literally ‘the pain of returning’).  Using public archive images and extracts from first person narratives of people with dementia, my talk explores the potential  of psychogeographical concepts such as the flaneur, and the dérive (or ‘drift’) for developing a more socio-historical perspective on the ‘wandering’ of people with dementia in mind, time and space. \r\n\r\nVenue: Baines Wing Miall Lecture Theatre 2.34, University of Leeds\r\nCampus map of buildings: click on this link, then launch the interactive campus map, and choose Baines Wing from the list on the right.\r\nhttp://www.leeds.ac.uk/timetable/assets/map/index.htm\r\nFrom the main entrance, go straight on past the front desk, then through the doors on the left.

Given the exquisite sensitivity of the individual brain/mind, to individual experiences, we need to explore the impact of the new environment of the 21st century on the kinds of people we may become.\r\n\r\nThis discourse will give an overview of three aspects of the mind and how we are trying to maximise its potential in the 21st century.\r\n\r\nThe developing mind\r\nThe 21st century presents a new environment of two dimensions, where children are currently spending some 6 hours a day in front of a screen.  If that screen mandates an environment of fast paced images of activities with no permanent consequences, and indeed a literal world dominated by strong sensations, what kind of individual might result?\r\n\r\nThe conscious mind\r\nConsciousness is arguably one of the biggest mysteries remaining for both science and philosophy.  The new techniques and approaches of 21st century neuroscience may not be solving the riddle of how the metaphorical water of neuronal activity is turned into wine of subjective experience, but is nonetheless offering us fascinating new approaches, and hence insights into this age-old puzzle.\r\n\r\nThe degenerating mind\r\nIn the 21st century, one person in three over the age of 60 will suffer from dementia in the UK. At the moment, there is no cure, nor pre-symptomatic diagnostic test.  One vision for tackling this serious and growing problem would be to couple a routine blood test that could detect the disease before the symptoms appear, with an oral medication that prevented any further cells dying - an effective cure!", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": null, "added": "2009-08-04T10:18:23", "slug": "b5751ce23a794b29", "speakers": [{"id": 1, "name": "Baroness Susan Greenfield", "slug": "baroness-susan-greenfield"}], "topics": [{"id": 928, "name": "neuroscience", "path": "/science/publicunderstandingofscience/neuroscience"}, {"id": 1594, "name": "neuroscience", "path": "/science/neuroscience"}], "supercategory": "science", "venue": {"id": 1729, "name": "The Royal Institution", "slug": "the-royal-institution", "city": "London", "postcode": "W1S 4BS"}, "organizer": {"id": 1729, "name": "The Royal Institution", "slug": "the-royal-institution"}, "date": "2009-09-25", "dates": [{"id": 7231, "from_date": "2009-09-25", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "20:00:00", "ticket_cost": "Tickets are free to Ri Full Members, £10 Associate Members and £15 guests.", "ticket_info": "For more information visit www.rigb.org or call the Events Team on 020 7409 2992 9.00am-5.00pm Monday to Friday", "additional_info": null, "members_only": "Yes", "members_info": "To become a member of the Ri please visit www.rigb.org/membership or call 020 7670 2919.", "venue": {"id": 1729, "name": "The Royal Institution", "slug": "the-royal-institution", "city": "London", "postcode": "W1S 4BS"}, "organizer": {"id": 1729, "name": "The Royal Institution", "slug": "the-royal-institution"}}]}, {"id": 6785, "title": "Archaeology Study Session", "synopsis": "Join us for a half day study session looking at Chester's Archaeology", "keywords": "Archaeology", "body": "Part of the Festival of British Archaeology  2009 celebrations.

His second book ‘The Prime Illusion: Holography In The New Age Of Digital Media’ has now been translated into Chinese by the University of Beijing Press, China to be published later this year.

Palaeontological programmes show bearded eccentrics making “the most important discovery ever”, always on the last day of the dig. They then enthusiastically reconstruct giant beasts - with double-decker buses as the unit of measurement - based on the smallest of fragments. Carnall will explain why most dinosaurs on display in museums are models, and what we see on TV is often science act, not science fact.\r\n\r\nThis light-hearted talk puts dinosaurs in their proper place. For a long time these prehistoric Hollywood creatures have hogged the limelight, but really they are minor players in palaeontology today. Their fossils are only useful for telling us about the individual animal and are of little use in reconstructing past environments. From fossil fragments, palaeontologists reconstruct the giant beasts which fill the halls of many natural history museums and grace the screen with their CGI presence.\r\n\r\nFollowing the talk, join us for a free glass of wine in a private view of the Museum.

But if thoughts and feelings arise from patterns of neural activity in the brain, then it should be possible to directly decode such conscious experiences from brain activity alone. Recent advances in brain imaging technology raise just such a possibility, by showing that it is possible to accurately decode a person's conscious experience based only on non-invasive measurements of their brain activity.

Notes to Editors:\r\n\r\n# The Dana Centre is a collaboration between the Science Museum, the BA (British Association for the Advancement of Science) and The European Dana Alliance for the Brain (EDAB) making it unrivalled in its expertise and depth of knowledge of scientific and technological fields. The Centre is housed in the Wellcome Wolfson Building alongside the headquarters of the BA, EDAB and Science Museum offices.\r\n# The £9.8 million building has been provided by four major benefactors – the Wellcome Trust, the Wolfson Foundation, The Dana Foundation and the Garfield Weston Foundation.\r\n# The Science Museum exists to promote the public understanding of the history and contemporary practice of science, medicine, technology and industry. It aims to inspire, educate and involve visitors. It achieves this by building, researching and caring for the national collections; and by interpreting these collections and engaging the public in the contemporary issues they raise.\r\n# The BA is the UK's nationwide, open membership organisation dedicated to connecting science with people, so that science and its applications become accessible to all. The BA aims to promote openness about science in society and to engage and inspire people directly with science and technology and their implications.\r\n# The goal of EDAB is to inform the general public and decision makers about the importance of brain research. EDAB aims to advance knowledge about the personal and public benefits of neuroscience and to disseminate information on the brain, in health and disease, in an accessible and relevant way.\r\n", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 15, "name": "Dana Centre", "slug": "dana-centre", "city": "London", "postcode": "SW7 5HE"}, "organizer": {"id": 46, "name": "Science Museum", "slug": "science-museum"}}]}, {"id": 333, "title": "Desert Island Specimens", "synopsis": "What are our scientists' favourite specimens?", "keywords": "specimens", "body": "Every scientist at the Museum has at least one favourite among our 70-million-strong collection of specimens.
