With a chequered history of Roman occupation, Chartist uprisings, and as a critically important sea port and railway town Newport has quickly developed to meet the expansion of economic and industrial heartlands of Wales. Newport is well described as a haven of modern Britain with its exotic mix of settlers of Welsh, Irish, English, Italian, Arab and Asian origins, and it is certainly one of the most lively multi-cultural and cosmopolitan cities of the country.\r\nThe town’s allegiance to the British monarchy has had its troubled past. As late as Queen Victoria’s Jubilee of 1897 the residents of Newport were only lurkwarm in their celebrations. However the succession of 20th century Princes of Wales have all found more love and interest created by their actions and high public profiles with more affection shown for them in Wales across religions, creeds and classes. The charismatic Edward, Prince of Wales was widely welcomed in Newport in 1921 when he rode on the town’s famous Transporter Bridge. In 1937 the new King George VI and Queen Elizabeth visited Newport to much praise and public cheering. After the Second World War several members of the Royal family passed through Newport and received a good Welsh welcome. It has not just been Royals who have given Newport the pleasure of a visit, many VIPS from all walks of life , politicians, Prime Ministers, stars of stage, screen and TV have also appeared in the town ( now a City).

Gregory Sams book explores the multiple issues around the idea of a living universe and brings some new thinking that aims to integrate spirituality with science. The implications of this thinking is startling, and aims to reveal a universe incorporating both intelligence and design without need of an Intelligent Designer.\r\n\r\nI was both excited and moved by this remarkable book.”\r\nColin Wilson, The Outsider\r\n\r\n“…will have a part to play in the global change of consciousness that is now, as never before, so desperately needed. Wonderful, clear-headed, thought-provoking material.” \r\nGraham Hancock, Fingerprints of the Gods, Supernatural, Ancient Teachers…\r\n\r\nAbout the Sun of God\r\n\r\nWhat if our Sun is not an accidental light bulb in the sky that just happens to radiate the light of life and hold a family of planets together? What if stars are not simply random balls of plasma reacting to nothing more than the laws of physics? What if the pagans were right and the church wrong about the divine nature of our local star? Perhaps our human race is but a bright spark of existence in a connected living Universe.\r\n\r\nIt was not science that burned all thought of a living Sun out of our culture but a jealous Church. Scientists maintain this religious taboo out of habit and not the scientific method. Yet as cosmologist Carl Sagan put it, “Our ancestors worshiped the Sun, and they were far from foolish…. If we must worship a power greater than ourselves, does it not make sense to revere the Sun and stars?”\r\n\r\nFor those who would tick the “spiritual but not religious” box, Sun of gOd provides easy-to-digest and thought-provoking insights into what it’s all about. \r\n\r\n“Simply one of the wisest, most lucid, and most thoughtfully written books that I’ve ever encountered integrating spirituality with science and other disciplines” \r\nResurgence magazine review, by David Jay Brown\r\n\r\n“… one of those most rare books, an unpretentious book of wisdom.” \r\nJohn Allen, Chairman, Global Ecotechnics, Originator of the Biosphere 2 Project\r\n\r\n“Your book is a masterpiece!” \r\nYouth, Killing Joke, Butterfly Studios\r\n\r\n“Sun of gOd is wise, persuasively reasoned, and thoughtfully written–not light reading, but rich, provocative, and worth savoring, like a fine meal. By the time we finish, Sams has served up a feast, moving fluidly between the micro and the macro, exploring self-organizing principles within the cosmos with resounding logic and common sense, and making great contributions to the global shift in consciousness” \r\nNew Consciousness Review\r\n\r\n“Sun of gOd presents a perfectly outrageous hypothesis: The sun is a conscious, living organism residing in a thriving galactic community, thinking stellar thoughts that span the entire universe. Surely this is nonsense. Except that the more you read the more a conscious universe begins to make sense. Gregory Sams’ book is a clearly written and persuasively reasoned argument to think about the sun in a radically new and refreshing way.”\r\nDean Radin, PhD, Senior Scientist, Institute of Noetic Sciences\r\n\r\nAbout Gregory Sams\r\n\r\nGregory Sams has established himself as a pioneer thinker and actor in the fields of food, fractals and science. From 1967, Gregory was pioneering natural foods in the UK, in partnership with his brother Craig. He opened Seed macrobiotic restaurant in Paddington at the age of 19, Ceres grain store in the Portobello Road soon after, then Harmony Foods (now Whole Earth Foods) in 1970, as well as being closely involved with Harmony magazine and Seed, the Journal of Organic Living. He conceived, created and launched the original VegeBurger in 1982, adding a new word to the language as he opened up the market for vegetarian foods.\r\n\r\nIn 1990 Greg moved out of food and into fractals, founding Strange Attractions – the world’s only shop ever dedicated to chaos theory. Trading as chaOs worKs, he went on to produce and license fractal images worldwide on everything from posters to book covers to fashion fabrics. His interest in chaos theory, however, was not just for the sexy psychedelic images, but for the social lessons inherent in our discovery of self-organizing systems throughout the natural world.\r\n\r\nThis led him to write and publish, in 1998, his first book, Uncommon Sense – the State is Out of Date. It was well received and, enjoying his role as an author, Gregory spent the first seven years of the new millennium writing Sun of gOd, Discover the Self-Organizing Consiousness that Underlies Everthing in which, as he puts it, the biggest elephant-in-the-room that you could ever imagine is unveiled. During 2013 he upgraded his first book, republished in 2014 and retitled The State Is Out of Date – We Can Do It Better.

St Etheldreda’s Church, Holborn, London’s earliest decorated Gothic church was returned to Catholicism in the C19th. (A way of explaining the Reformation in London). With St Paul’s Cathedral, Wren’s deft playing around with plans to fool the Cathedral Commissioners that he was building a perfect Anglican cathedral ended up being a baroque one (a chunk of Rome transplanted to the City). At St Andrew, Holborn, Wren adapted a medieval church to classical Anglicanism while at St Mary Le Bow, he used French classical references. At St Vedast, Foster Lane, he absorbed the baroque, a highly Catholic style, into an Anglican church and at St James’s Piccadilly you will explore how London was spreading into the new West End. Here you will see how Wren created his ideal of the perfect Anglican church, where the congregation could hear/see the priest from all corners of the church and its gallery.\r\n\r\nThe walk on 30 November will remain within the City of London.\t", "additional_info": null, "duration": 120, "image_id": null, "added": "2016-06-06T11:04:42", "slug": "how-london-became-the-greatest-city-on-earth-36", "speakers": [{"id": 16217, "name": "Harry Mount", "slug": "harry-mount"}], "topics": [{"id": 131, "name": "authors", "path": "/arts/literature/fiction/british/21stcentury/authors"}, {"id": 106, "name": "wwi", "path": "/arts/books/history/military/wwi"}, {"id": 107, "name": "wwii", "path": "/arts/books/history/military/wwii"}, {"id": 108, "name": "army", "path": "/arts/books/history/military/army"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 2725, "name": "The University Women's Club", "slug": "the-university-womens-club", "city": "London", "postcode": "W1K 1DB"}, "organizer": {"id": 2290, "name": "THE COURSE", "slug": "the-course"}, "date": "2016-11-23", "dates": [{"id": 15966, "from_date": "2016-11-23", "to_date": "2016-11-23", "time": "10:45:00", "ticket_cost": "£54.00", "ticket_info": "info@thecoursestudies.co.uk", "additional_info": "visit www.thecoursestudies.co.uk", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 2725, "name": "The University Women's Club", "slug": "the-university-womens-club", "city": "London", "postcode": "W1K 1DB"}, "organizer": {"id": 2290, "name": "THE COURSE", "slug": "the-course"}}]}, {"id": 14633, "title": "The Story Of St Katharine's", "synopsis": "Learn more about this fascinating area, very rich in history.

Originally published in 1924, Friedrich’s work begins with an impassioned plea, addressed ‘To Human Beings in all lands’, to understand the causes of war and to take steps to prevent it.\r\n\r\nThe photos that follow are accompanied by annotations, sometimes understated, sometimes bitterly ironic, and contrast nationalist propaganda with the appalling reality of the conflict. Friedrich’s work is a condemnation of war which remains shocking and relevant to this day.\r\n\r\nAnthony Zurbrugg, editor of ‘Not Our War: Writings against the First World War’ (Merlin Press, 2014), will introduce his new book. This anthology presents the diverse voices of men and women who questioned and opposed the war: liberals, radicals and pacifists, anarchists and socialists, soldiers and non-combatants.\r\n\r\nThey asked critical questions: Was this a war for civilization? What were the forces behind the war? How might it have been prevented?

The writer starts to exist in this moment of tracing. As such the trace of writing is a performative act which can be connected to the temporality of a physical body. It can be seen as a gestural choreography. But where the gestures disappear into their moment of performance, writing itself really only starts to exist once the act of tracing has been concluded, and the writer has disappeared. It is in this paradox, in this balancing between absence and presence, life and death, writing and written that I have located a lot of my practice as a writer and performer. \r\n\r\nIn this performative talk, I will actualise and expand on some of the material and philosophical questions that tie gestures of inscription to the development of a text, and in what ways performing a text can in turn inscribe the material shadows of physicality back into writing.\r\n\r\nAbout Caroline...\r\n\r\nCaroline Bergvall is a writer and artist of French-Norwegian origins, based in London. She works across lan¬guages, artforms and media. She is a strong exponent of writing methods adapted to contemporary audiovisual and contextual concerns and multilingual identities. Her language-based pieces and micro structures frequently revisit literary models as well as tackle historical and political events. Projects alternate between performances, sited installations, textual and graphic work, and audio pieces.

But the economic events of the past decade, combined with the actions of politicians from both sides, have undermined capitalism’s reputation. In 'A Capitalism for the People', which he will discuss in this lecture, Zingales warns that the US economy risks deteriorating into a Berlusconi-style crony-capitalist system – pro-business rather than pro-market, and run by corrupt politicians who are more concerned with lining the pockets of the connected elite than with improving opportunity for the people. If it continues to lose popular support, can capitalism survive?

The sale of padded bras and Playboy-branded goods to little girls has been branded ‘corporate paedophilia’, while many parents also worry about explicitly raunchy music videos and TV aimed at the Skins generation, and the ready availability of hardcore pornography on the internet (along with the associated dangers of ‘sexting’ and online grooming). Even those who have enjoyed the liberation of the permissive society for themselves are uneasy when it comes to drawing the boundary between what is acceptable for adults and what is appropriate for children.\r\n\r\nThe issue has become politicised in recent years, with four government reviews in four years commissioned on related themes. Yet despite widespread agreement that society has become ‘sexualised’ and that this is infecting childhood, the questions of what ‘sexualisation’ actually means, why it has come about, and what can be done about it, are seldom answered. The Bailey review commissioned by David Cameron and led by Reg Bailey of the Mother’s Union shied away from any attempt to explain the trend towards the ‘commercialisation and sexualisation of childhood’, which it claimed was a cause of concern to many parents. The review acknowledges that there are two main responses to this anxiety. Some argue for greater regulation in an attempt to protect childhood as a more innocent time, away from the predations of adult sexual culture and consumer culture. Others argue instead that youngsters need earlier sex, relationships and media education to help them deal with a sexual culture where they will be targeted by the distorting forces of the market. But what are we to make of the underlying premises of the discussion?\r\n\r\nHas the sexualisation of society really gone too far, or should we all learn to be more comfortable discussing sexuality in frank and honest terms? Is it naive or wrong-headed to want to protect childhood as a time of innocence? Does protecting childhood inevitably inhibit adult freedom, or is it simply about taking grown-up responsibility?

The taste for all things Gothic is nearly two hundred and fifty years old. It embraces architecture, literature, theatre, fashion, painting, folk tales, film, photography and even tourism.

There are many examples of this, such as replanting degraded forests to provide clean water or rehabilitating degraded mangroves for storm protection.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are relatively few studies that examine the costs and benefits of investment restoration or conservation projects in a way that is useful for decision makers. As a result, investing in natural capital does not receive the same level of attention from finance ministries as investing in other sectors of the economy.\r\n\r\nThis meeting will highlight the multiple ways in which it makes economic, social and environmental sense to invest in natural capital, and examine the means by which existing efforts can be ‘scaled up'.\r\n\r\n_Organised by Natasha Pauli and Anisha Grover, ZSL._\r\n\r\nThis event in the 'Wildlife Conservation' series will begin at 6.00pm (doors from 5.00pm) and talks are scheduled to finish at 7.30pm; admission is free and open to everyone (no advance booking or registration required). This event will be held in the ZSL Meeting Rooms and seats will be on a first-come, first-served basis. A dinner with the speakers will follow this event and places must be booked in advance. A dinner booking form will be provided from the ZSL website shortly; please download for further information.\r\n\r\n*ZSL Science and Conservation Events:* An essential part of ZSL's work is to communicate relevant, high-quality zoological and conservation science.

Trying to cope with change, but failing? Want to know what it all means? Stop trying to understand, and start training your intuition. Life in the network society cannot be planned, it will be improvised, whether you like it or not. This is a good thing. Musicians have been improvising for ages, and there may be more to learn from art, music and culture than you think when it comes down to business. Open your mind and your ears and listen to that inner voice. Dick Rijken will talk about the past, the present and the future of STEIM, a laboratory for digital live performance in Amsterdam.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n==================\r\nAbout Dick Rijken\r\n==================\r\nDick Rijken is director of STEIM and professor at The Hague University of Applied Sciences. He also works as an independent consultant in the field of digital culture and new media and is a policy advisor for the Dutch government and for the EU.\r\n\r\nHis primary interest is the changing role of culture in western society.

In both Western and Russian historiography the Russian achievement in 1813-14 is greatly underestimated, which seriously distorts understanding of European power politics and the causes of Napoleon's demise. The lecture explains this underestimate partly as a legacy of Leo Tolstoy but also because while 1812 was traditionally seen by Russians as a national war, the victories of 1813-14 were interpreted as the triumph of the dynasty and empire. \r\n\r\nDominic Lieven graduated first in his year, 1973, at the University of Cambridge.

What is clear is that in the past the boundaries between all three were far from clear. So while ‘occult science' might seem a contradiction in terms, it was in fact at the heart of intellectual knowledge. The medieval and early modern quest to discover the ‘occult' or ‘hidden' properties of nature was a scientific endeavour that required an exploration of the possibilities of magic. The motive of many magicians at the time was to attain wisdom and knowledge through contact with the spirit world. Instructions on how to perform such magic, and accounts of the secret knowledge obtained from re-discovered ancient sources, were recorded in grimoires. Despite the best efforts of the Inquisitions these magic books circulated in increasing numbers during the medieval period, and with the advent of print their influence would spread far beyond the libraries of the wealthy and educated. From the eighteenth century, cheap print grimoires began to appear. The centre of publication was France, and their distribution and influence in French colonies generated new notions of what it meant to ‘make science'.", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": null, "added": "2009-03-13T09:59:07", "slug": "dc91735620ca1db0", "speakers": [{"id": 8142, "name": "Professor Owen Davies", "slug": "professor-owen-davies"}], "topics": [{"id": 1338, "name": "science", "path": "/arts/history/science"}, {"id": 164, "name": "history", "path": "/science/history"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 1729, "name": "The Royal Institution", "slug": "the-royal-institution", "city": "London", "postcode": "W1S 4BS"}, "organizer": {"id": 1729, "name": "The Royal Institution", "slug": "the-royal-institution"}, "date": "2009-05-13", "dates": [{"id": 6853, "from_date": "2009-05-13", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "19:00:00", "ticket_cost": "Tickets cost £8, £6 concessions, £4 Ri members", "ticket_info": "For more information visit www.rigb.org or call the Events Team on 020 7409 2992 9.00am-5.00pm Monday to Friday", "additional_info": null, "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 1729, "name": "The Royal Institution", "slug": "the-royal-institution", "city": "London", "postcode": "W1S 4BS"}, "organizer": {"id": 1729, "name": "The Royal Institution", "slug": "the-royal-institution"}}]}, {"id": 6484, "title": "Poetry and Guitar", "synopsis": "Poetry and Guitar", "keywords": "Poetry Music Politics", "body": "Paul Howe and Steve Parker bring us an entertaining and thought provoking evening of words and music.

Oscar winning director Ron Howard brings this remarkable story to the screen, not only recreating the on-air interview, but also showing the motivations of both men, and the around-the-world, behind the scenes maneuvering and machinations at play. Frost/Nixon will be officially released in the UK on 23 January 2009.\r\n\r\nFor three years after being forced from office, Nixon remained silent.  But in 1977, the steely, cunning former commander-in-chief agreed to sit for one all-inclusive interview to confront the unanswered questions of his time in office and the Watergate scandal that ended his presidency.  Nixon surprised everyone in selecting Frost as his televised confessor, intending to easily outfox the breezy British showman and reclaim his status as a supreme statesman in the hearts and minds of Americans.\r\n\r\nLikewise, Frost’s team harbored doubts about his ability to hold his own against Nixon.  As cameras rolled, a charged battle of wits ensued.  Would Nixon evade questions of his role in one of the nation’s greatest disgraces?  Or would Frost confound critics and bravely demand accountability from the most skilled politician of his generation? \r\n\r\nThe encounter would reveal each man’s insecurities, ego and reserves of dignity—as both ultimately set aside posturing in a stunning display of unvarnished truth.\r\n\r\nPeter Morgan is widely hailed as one of Britain's leading screenwriters having won major accolades for his work on stage and screen. His previous works include The Last King of Scotland and The Queen, for which he received an Academy Award nomination.

He asks why in the West these are beginning to break down and what part addiction plays in the human psyche.\r\n·\tRita Carter, author of Mapping the Mind, explains what is happening in our heads as our emotions take charge and explores a future where new pharmacological innovations will allow us to directly manipulate the brain to induce feelings of wellbeing.\r\n·\tChaired by Madeleine Bunting, the Guardian. \r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 120, "image_id": 598, "added": "2006-06-15T15:53:54", "slug": "b5a619b8d9b962cf", "speakers": [{"id": 4047, "name": "Professor Richard Schoch", "slug": "professor-richard-schoch"}, {"id": 4048, "name": "Mr Sebastian Saville", "slug": "mr-sebastian-saville"}, {"id": 4049, "name": "Rita Carter", "slug": "rita-carter"}, {"id": 4050, "name": "Guardian columnist Madeleine Bunting", "slug": "guardian-columnist-madeleine-bunting"}], "topics": [{"id": 170, "name": "newtopic", "path": "/science/chemistry/biochemistry/catalysis/newtopic"}, {"id": 687, "name": "society", "path": "/arts/architecture/planning/society"}, {"id": 123, "name": "mobility", "path": "/society/urbanisation/planning/mobility"}, {"id": 910, "name": "science", "path": "/arts/film/documentary/science"}, {"id": 124, "name": "archaeology", "path": "/academic/archaeology"}, {"id": 299, "name": "health", "path": "/academic/health"}, {"id": 332, "name": "philosophy", "path": "/academic/philosophy"}, {"id": 469, "name": "psychiatry", "path": "/academic/psychiatry"}, {"id": 892, "name": "psychoanalysis", "path": "/academic/psychoanalysis"}], "supercategory": "science", "venue": {"id": 1055, "name": "Soho Theatre", "slug": "soho-theatre", "city": "London", "postcode": "W1D 3NE"}, "organizer": {"id": 1032, "name": "Wellcome Trust", "slug": "wellcome-trust"}, "date": "2006-07-11", "dates": [{"id": 3258, "from_date": "2006-07-11", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "18:30:00", "ticket_cost": "FREE", "ticket_info": "This is a FREE event but booking is essential.
