The tradition was rooted in a pagan veneration of polytheistic Gods, while at the same time it recognized a singular First Principle – a transcending First God. How are we to understand this theological framework, so strange to the modern mind? Is a recognition of the Gods an optional extra in Platonic philosophy – an element we can eliminate without damage to its metaphysical and ethical structures? In what way do the mythological tales of Gods and heroes both reveal and obscure the part played by the Gods in Platonic philosophy? Can we look behind the vivid and beautiful stories and find the truths which so inspired the sages of the ancient tradition?\r\n\r\nIn a series of three linked evenings we will look at number of passages from the writings of some of the finest thinkers of the tradition with a view to seeing again the world with their eyes – perhaps to the point at which we can say with them \"all things are full of the Gods.\" Each of the three evenings will begin with a short introduction to an aspect of the subject and then move on to the extracts to be read: we should have at least an hour to discuss the ideas arising from these passages.

His most recent book Why We Can’t Afford the Rich (2014, Policy Press), was written for a non-academic audience to explain and evaluate the remarkable return of the rich over the last 30 years.\r\n\r\nIn partnership with the British Sociological Association ", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": null, "added": "2016-10-18T11:11:28", "slug": "6f26d0c908501826", "speakers": [{"id": 16391, "name": "Professor Andrew Sayer", "slug": "professor-andrew-sayer"}], "topics": [{"id": 2238, "name": "equality", "path": "/politics/multiculturalism/debate/equality"}, {"id": 3029, "name": "equality", "path": "/academic/economic/welfare/equality"}, {"id": 1554, "name": "wealth", "path": "/academic/economics/wealth"}], "supercategory": "politics", "venue": {"id": 3231, "name": "British Library", "slug": "british-library", "city": "London", "postcode": "NW1 2DB"}, "organizer": {"id": 3231, "name": "British Library", "slug": "british-library"}, "date": "2016-10-24", "dates": [{"id": 16187, "from_date": "2016-10-24", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "18:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Full Price: £10, Senior 60+: £8, Student: £7, Registered Unemployed: £7, Under 18: £7, Friend of the", "ticket_info": "http://bit.ly/2dFJ5Uh", "additional_info": null, "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 3231, "name": "British Library", "slug": "british-library", "city": "London", "postcode": "NW1 2DB"}, "organizer": {"id": 3231, "name": "British Library", "slug": "british-library"}}]}, {"id": 15385, "title": "How to put the WOW in your workshop!

Why was this? Modern commentators often suggest that this was merely cultural conditioning, and an aspect of the Platonic tradition which can safely be ignored. But this upholding of pagan practices continued well into the sixth century AD and so strong was their adherence, that in 529AD the emperor Justinian forced the closure of the Platonic schools simply because they were the main source of opposition to the contemporary Christian Church and Christianized Emperorship. Perhaps, then, there were good reasons that these philosophers framed their philosophy within the pagan worldview. This lecture and study session will look at the metaphysical and theological basis of the Platonic tradition and explore this largely neglected area of philosophy. We will ask whether a coherent metaphysics is possible without the Gods, and whether human life, both ethical and artistic, is enhanced by a philosophy which affirms that \"all things are full of the Gods.\"\r\n\r\nThis is the third of three linked evenings on this theme: this session will be based around a reading of part Proclus' writings on the subject.

Often marked by a pole star, this pivot grounded the human sense of being in the world, orientating us both practically and spiritually. It was envisioned as the summit of a cosmic axis linking us to the realm of the gods, and the centre of a vortex offering passage into this spiritual otherworld. The scientific revolution kicked off by the work of Copernicus unseated this geocentric vision, which was cast aside as a naive relic. For many modern people trying to maintain a connection to the spirit, and to nature as it presents itself to us, this is a great loss. Surely this fundamental vision, grounded in our most basic perceptions of the world, deserves a better fate than to be discarded\r\nby the literalism of science?\r\n\r\nBut is this vision fundamental? Based on years of research, this talk explores the idea that the image of the world pivoted on an axis, binding us to the gods above, is largely a product of agricultural societies, and - like all cosmologies - is deeply moulded by power relations in society. The scientific revolution, rather than merely cutting us off from the ancient religious way of being, also represents an ongoing opportunity to revive the egalitarianism and decentred animism which dominated human life for tens of thousands of years before the realm of the spirit was forced to reflect our social hierarchies.\r\n\r\nGyrus is a writer and publisher based in north London.

Together they were swept up in the growing resistance to apartheid, and together they experienced repression and exile. Their contributions to the liberation struggle, as individuals and as a couple, are undeniable. Ruth agitated tirelessly for the overthrow of apartheid, first in South Africa and then from abroad, and Joe directed much of the armed struggle carried out by the infamous Umkhonto we Sizwe (abbreviated as MK, translated as \"Spear of the Nation\"). Only one of them, however, would survive to see the fall of the old regime and the founding of a new, democratic South Africa.\r\n\r\nWieder’s heavily researched work draws on the usual primary and secondary sources but also an extensive oral history that he has collected over many years. By intertwining the documentary record with personal interviews, he portrays the complexities and contradictions of this extraordinary couple and their efforts to navigate a time of great tension, upheaval, and revolutionary hope.\r\n\r\nAlan Wieder is an oral historian who lives in Portland, Oregon. He is distinguished professor emeritus at the University of South Carolina and has also taught at the University of the Western Cape and Stellenbosch University in South Africa. He has written widely on South Africans who fought against the apartheid regime.\r\n\r\nEvent information\r\n\r\nHousmans Bookshop\r\n5 Caledonian Road\r\nKing's Cross\r\nLondon N1 9DX \r\nTel: 020 7837 4473\r\nwww.housmans.com\r\n\r\nEntry £3, redeemable against purchase.\r\nNearest tube: King's Cross\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": null, "added": "2014-04-09T16:34:14", "slug": "62f9006b01961000", "speakers": [{"id": 14636, "name": "Alan  Wieder", "slug": "alan-wieder"}], "topics": [{"id": 3105, "name": "africa", "path": "/business/economy/growth/southasia/africa"}, {"id": 3444, "name": "apartheid", "path": "/politics/africa/southafrica/apartheid"}, {"id": 1224, "name": "africa", "path": "/arts/photography/photojournalism/africa"}, {"id": 2746, "name": "africa", "path": "/academic/economics/economicrecession/africa"}], "supercategory": "business", "venue": {"id": 2783, "name": "Housmans Bookshop", "slug": "housmans-bookshop", "city": "London", "postcode": "N1 9DX"}, "organizer": {"id": 2783, "name": "Housmans Bookshop", "slug": "housmans-bookshop"}, "date": "2014-04-30", "dates": [{"id": 14108, "from_date": "2014-04-30", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "19:00:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": null, "additional_info": "HOW TO FIND US:\r\nWe're very easy to find - just a two minute walk from King's Cross/St.Pancras terminals.

Taylor’s ‘Negative Capitalism: Cynicism in the Neoliberal Era’ offers a new conceptual framework for understanding the current economic crisis. It argues that cynicism has become culturally embedded in the UK and US as an effect of a broad disempowerment fostered by neoliberal capitalism.\r\n\r\nDespite the deprivation and collapse of key social infrastructure such as representative democracy, welfare, workers' rights and equal access to resources, there has so far been no collective, effective and sustained overthrow of capitalism. Why is this? The book's central call is for new strategies that unravel this narcissistic cynicism, embracing social democracy, constitutional rights, mass bankruptcies and animate sabotage.\r\n\r\nKafka, Foucault, Ballard and de Sade are clashed with the X-Factor, ruinporn, London, and the artwork of Laura Oldfield Ford. Negative Capitalism's polemic is written to incite responses against the cynical malaise of the neoliberal era.\r\nJ.D. Taylor is a writer and community worker from south London. His experiences come from three years' frontline working in various charities and community support services, as well as a Cultural Studies MA from Goldsmiths. Working under various pseudonyms as an active participant in the contemporary anti-cuts movement, he was also taught by Mark Fisher in the FE college which provides much of the empirical basis of his 'Capitalist Realism'.\r\n\r\n“Negative Capitalism represents a new generation of critique by what I've termed graduates without a future. Taylor brings together incisive and provocative analysis alongside personal experience to explore how debt, cynicism, smartphones, psychopharmacology, underemployment and neoliberalism all represent a new era of negation.

Their research combines the properties of plastics with the functionality of semiconductors to create innovative technologies at dramatically lower production costs. Professor Bradley’s experimental investigations have significantly advanced the understanding of the physics of conjugated polymers as semiconductors and helped to demonstrate their widespread application potential.\r\n\r\nPlastic electronics can be printed on various substrates to create devices such as thin film transistors or resistors. Printed electronics is expected to facilitate widespread, very low-cost electronics for applications such as flexible displays, smart labels, decorative and animated posters, and active clothing.\r\n\r\nThe most important benefit of printing is low-cost volume fabrication. The lower cost enables use in more applications. An example is radio frequency identification, RFID-systems, which enable contactless identification in trade and transport. In some domains, such as light-emitting diodes printing does not impact performance. Printing on flexible substrates allows electronics to be placed on curved surfaces, for example, putting solar cells on vehicle roofs. \r\n\r\nThis plastic electronics technology has the potential for use in multiple applications including displays, solar energy, solid-state lighting, imaging and sensing, medical diagnostics, photonics and communications. In terms of consumer electronics, this means a wide range of devices can be developed, updated, or revolutionised – from flat screen televisions to e-book readers, from smart windows to printed circuit boards.\r\n\r\nDo plastic electronics have the potential to change the world? What is the appeal of using printing processes to generate large scale electronics products and devices? What kind of applications can we envisage in the future which could change the way we live now?  \r\n\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 120, "image_id": null, "added": "2012-05-09T07:07:44", "slug": "6249e6dc75c7c7b4", "speakers": [{"id": 12379, "name": "Professor Donal Bradley", "slug": "professor-donal-bradley"}], "topics": [{"id": 2985, "name": "plastics", "path": "/science/plastics"}, {"id": 2984, "name": "electronics", "path": "/science/electronics"}], "supercategory": "science", "venue": {"id": 1220, "name": "Friends of Imperial College", "slug": "friends-of-imperial-college", "city": "London", "postcode": "SW7 2AZ"}, "organizer": {"id": 1220, "name": "Friends of Imperial College", "slug": "friends-of-imperial-college"}, "date": "2012-05-15", "dates": [{"id": 11565, "from_date": "2012-05-15", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "19:00:00", "ticket_cost": "£3 - £10", "ticket_info": "admin@friendsofimperial.org.uk\r\nwww.friendsofimperial.org.uk\r\n01243 576150", "additional_info": null, "members_only": "No", "members_info": "www.friendsofimperial.org.uk\r\nadmin@friendsofimperial.org.uk\r\n01243 576150", "venue": {"id": 1220, "name": "Friends of Imperial College", "slug": "friends-of-imperial-college", "city": "London", "postcode": "SW7 2AZ"}, "organizer": {"id": 1220, "name": "Friends of Imperial College", "slug": "friends-of-imperial-college"}}]}, {"id": 10779, "title": "One Plus One: Picture Editing After Bataille", "synopsis": "David Evans and Patrizia di Bello discuss radical picture editing by historical figures such as Georges Bataille, Bertolt Brecht and Guy Debord, as well as contemporary resonances.", "keywords": "photography; art; art theory", "body": "David Evans teaches at the Arts University College at Bournemouth.

They will share with you the results to date of their pioneering research into the restoration of two very different, yet similarly challenged, forest ecosystems.  \r\n\r\nLearn how Earthwatch, with your support, can reverse the decline of a vitally important – yet undervalued – natural resource.", "additional_info": null, "duration": 180, "image_id": null, "added": "2010-04-21T09:35:00", "slug": "earthwatch-lecture-series-2010-forests-challenged-by-a-changing-climate", "speakers": [{"id": 9664, "name": "Dr Mark  Huxham", "slug": "dr-mark-huxham"}, {"id": 9665, "name": "Dr Glen  Reynolds", "slug": "dr-glen-reynolds"}], "topics": [{"id": 868, "name": "climate", "path": "/science/climatechange/climate"}, {"id": 1992, "name": "change", "path": "/politics/economics/change"}, {"id": 570, "name": "environment", "path": "/science/environment/environment"}, {"id": 895, "name": "environment", "path": "/politics/europe/environment"}], "supercategory": "science", "venue": {"id": 494, "name": "Royal Geographical Society", "slug": "royal-geographical-society", "city": "London", "postcode": "SW7 2AR"}, "organizer": {"id": 2249, "name": "Earthwatch", "slug": "earthwatch"}, "date": "2010-05-20", "dates": [{"id": 8594, "from_date": "2010-05-20", "to_date": "2010-05-20", "time": "18:00:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": "Register for a free ticket at http://www.earthwatch.org/europe/get_involved/events/lectures/", "additional_info": "http://www.earthwatch.org/europe/get_involved/events/lectures/", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 494, "name": "Royal Geographical Society", "slug": "royal-geographical-society", "city": "London", "postcode": "SW7 2AR"}, "organizer": {"id": 2249, "name": "Earthwatch", "slug": "earthwatch"}}]}, {"id": 8202, "title": "The Greek Fiscal Crisis and the Future of the Euro-Zone ", "synopsis": "Hellenic Observatory panel debate ", "keywords": "greece, fiscal crisis", "body": "The fiscal crisis in Greece has received much international coverage.

Of course, how we decide on future virtuous behaviour depends on our interpretation of past sins, on what and who we blame and for today’s difficulties. \r\n\r\nThe economic crisis is regularly presented as ‘payback time’ for human greed. The Labour-left Compass group notes approvingly that ‘In the current recession various corrections are taking place: blanket free-market approaches are being rejected, as are blanket individualistic and materialistic attitudes’. Green thinkers see the crisis as a timely reminder that we must curtail our economic activity and carbon-emitting lifestyles; maybe now we will finally accept the environmentalist mantra that less is more. Many argue for ‘Post-Crunch Corporate Ethics’ to rein-in risky ventures and penalise big business excesses. Some even argue the inevitable austerity on the horizon could encourage a return to shared values and bring a new social cohesion. \r\n\r\nThese cultural critiques of capitalism all agree we have over-reached ourselves, allowed economic growth to distort our priorities, and sacrificed the planet, and our own well-being on the altar of ‘filthy lucre’.

Within an infected individual, pathogen populations face direct attack by the different processes of the immune system; at a community level, immunity affects pathogen fitness by reducing the pool of susceptible persons. Professor Gupta will discuss how pathogens have evolved under this form of natural selection and found solutions that allow them to persist within individuals and within communities using examples from malaria, bacterial meningitis and influenza.\r\n\r\nProfessor Gupta is Professor of Theoretical Epidemiology at the University of Oxford. Professor Gupta's main area of interest is the evolution of diversity in pathogens, with particular reference to the infectious disease agents that are responsible for malaria, influenza and bacterial meningitis. She has recently been awarded the Zoological Society of London Scientific medal in 2008. Professor Gupta also has an interest in the public understanding of science and the connections between science and literature. She has been longlisted for the Orange Book Prize in 2000 and was awarded the Southern Arts UK Prize for Literature in 2000.

Such protected freshwater sites present a major challenge due to the fact that many pressures arise off-site (i.e. within the wider catchment); the wide range of different human activities which operate in those catchments and which affect freshwater ecosystems; and the complex interactions between such activities.  Pollution remains one of these key pressures.  Over recent years there has been extensive investment in tackling major point sources of pollution, and country wide initiatives are underway which aim to deal with diffuse pollution and its effects on SSSIs. \r\nBut how do we determine our objectives for managing pollution in areas designated for nature conservation?  What powers and measures do we have to deal with this problem and how do we determine responsibility for action where there may be multiple causes of a problem?

It has long been suspected that some answers to this enigma will be found buried within the genome. With recent advances in genetic technologies, such suspicions are beginning to be confirmed. One molecule at the heart of this new wave of research is a gene called FOXP2. People who carry mutations of FOXP2 have problems with the learning and production of sequences of mouth movements needed for speech, along with deficits in language and grammar.\r\n\r\nIntriguingly, FOXP2 is a control gene that can switch on and off other genes in the brain. It is evolutionarily ancient, found in similar form in many diverse species, including birds, rodents and fish, but there is evidence that its role(s) may have been modified during human evolution.\r\n\r\nRather than being the mythical \"gene for language\", FOXP2 represents just one important piece of a complex puzzle.

Subjects \r\nexplored will range from the nature of reality to mind science or \r\nmeditation, from Florence Nightingale's vision of a good hospital to \r\neco-houses, from intriguing new healing methods arising from world \r\ntraditional medical systems to the impact of technology upon us.\r\n\r\nAmy Corzine's book is essential reading for anyone who has ever wondered if \r\nthere was a healthier and happier way to live.\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 60, "image_id": null, "added": "2008-10-10T07:09:19", "slug": "3db8f8b1527da593", "speakers": [{"id": 7554, "name": "Amy Corzine", "slug": "amy-corzine"}], "topics": [{"id": 170, "name": "newtopic", "path": "/science/chemistry/biochemistry/catalysis/newtopic"}, {"id": 910, "name": "science", "path": "/arts/film/documentary/science"}, {"id": 169, "name": "catalysis", "path": "/science/chemistry/biochemistry/catalysis"}, {"id": 431, "name": "science", "path": "/arts/books/science"}], "supercategory": "science", "venue": {"id": 1797, "name": "Fulham Library", "slug": "fulham-library", "city": "London", "postcode": "SW6 5NX"}, "organizer": {"id": 1795, "name": "LB Hammersmith & Fulham", "slug": "lb-hammersmith-fulham"}, "date": "2008-10-20", "dates": [{"id": 6293, "from_date": "2008-10-20", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "19:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": "Fulham Library 020 8753 3877 or email debby.wale@lbhf.gov.uk", "additional_info": null, "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 1797, "name": "Fulham Library", "slug": "fulham-library", "city": "London", "postcode": "SW6 5NX"}, "organizer": {"id": 1795, "name": "LB Hammersmith & Fulham", "slug": "lb-hammersmith-fulham"}}]}, {"id": 5615, "title": "Sowing the seed", "synopsis": "Illustrated with stunning images, this event will explore the weird and wonderful methods that plants use to disperse their seeds.", "keywords": "seeds, art, graphics, biology", "body": "Illustrated with stunning images, this event will explore the weird and wonderful methods that plants use to disperse their seeds and ensure their survival, as seen through the eyes of an artist.\r\n\r\nThis event takes place at the Royal Institution and tickets cost £8 standard, £6 concessions, £4 RI Members.

Moreover, those developing countries that are the largest capital exporters tend to invest more domestically and to grow faster than those that still depend on capital imports. These facts create serious puzzles for mainstream economic models and reject most of their predictions. The report calls for a fresh approach to development financing that focuses less on the mobilization of savings and more on the direct stimulation of investment. UNCTAD also makes an important contribution in the report to the Doha Conference to review the implementation of the Monterrey Consensus on financing for development (Qatar, 29 November - 2 December 2008). \r\n\r\nSupachai Panitchpakdi began his four-year term as Secretary-General of UNCTAD on 1 September 2005, following his appointment by the UN General Assembly. Dr. Supachai previously served as Director-General of the World Trade Organization (September 2002 to August 2005). He is a former Deputy Prime Minister of Thailand who was entrusted with oversight of the country´s economic and trade policy making. In this role, he was actively involved in international trade policy and represented Thailand at the signing ceremony in Marrakech of the Uruguay Round Agreement in 1994. He was also active in shaping regional agreements, including Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the Asia Europe Meeting (ASEM). \r\n\r\nHeiner Flassbeck is UNCTAD Director of Division of Globalization and Development Strategies. Robert Wade is Professor of International Political Economy at LSE. \r\n\r\nThe United Nations Conference on Trade and Development was established in 1964. UNTAD promotes the development-friendly integration of developing countries into the world economy. It has evolved into an authoritative knowledge-based institution whose work aims to shape policy debates and thinking on development, with a particular focus on ensuring that domestic policies and international action are mutually supportive in bringing about sustainable development. \r\n\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 732, "added": "2008-08-05T02:44:26", "slug": "8a4fffe32d4a94fb", "speakers": [{"id": 7063, "name": "Supachai Panitchpakdi", "slug": "supachai-panitchpakdi"}, {"id": 5780, "name": "Dr  Heiner Flassbeck", "slug": "dr-heiner-flassbeck"}, {"id": 5781, "name": "Professor Robert Wade", "slug": "professor-robert-wade"}, {"id": 5619, "name": "Chair: Professor  Stuart Corbridge", "slug": "chair-professor-stuart-corbridge"}], "topics": [{"id": 1576, "name": "development", "path": "/society/media/media/development"}, {"id": 827, "name": "finance", "path": "/business/training/finance"}, {"id": 373, "name": "development", "path": "/academic/linguistics/development"}, {"id": 375, "name": "development", "path": "/science/psychology/development"}], "supercategory": "society", "venue": {"id": 1520, "name": "New Theatre, London School of Economics & Political Science", "slug": "new-theatre-london-school-of-economics-political-science", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC2A 2AE"}, "organizer": {"id": 1287, "name": "London School of Economics & Political Science", "slug": "london-school-of-economics-political-science"}, "date": "2008-09-03", "dates": [{"id": 5875, "from_date": "2008-09-03", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "18:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": "The event is free and open to all with no ticket required.

He is an environmental scientist with a leading role in European land-based natural resources policy.  His particular interest is in soil systems and he is the current chairman of the European Soil Bureau Network, as well as coordinator of a pan-European project (ENVASSO) providing technical support to the European Thematic Strategy for Soil Protection and the planned Soil Framework Directive.  He joined Cranfield in 2002 from the Environment Agency where he was Head of Land Quality and he previously worked for Hyder Consulting, DTI, ADAS and Severn-Trent.  He has an academic background in business economics and marketing, as well as soil science and environmental chemistry. \r\nHis lecture will cover the following themes:\r\nSoil is a form of natural capital.  It is a living system of great complexity that delivers hugely valuable ecosystem services in both rural and urban environments.  The management of soil has profound consequences for future economic and social outcomes.  This lecture will describe the soil system and some new scientific insights in to the evolution and functionality of the soil habitat.  It will summarise the main threats to soil and critique the strongly emergent soil protection policy agenda within the European Union and the UK.  A framework for future soil protection strategy will be explored, focusing on soil within existing and new urban development.  This will include options for improving awareness of soil among urban citizens and decision-makers, and the use of new technology for collecting data and reporting information on the spatial extent of soil-based natural capital and the impacts on this from different land allocation and management scenarios.  Questions that the lecture aims to answer are  “What controls should be placed on future development to protect soil-based natural capital?  How can soil within the urban zone be managed best to protect and enhance natural capital?  How can the slow pace of soil development be accommodated within a rapidly growing urban economy?  How can soils help us to adapt to climate change?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 120, "image_id": null, "added": "2006-12-01T00:58:09", "slug": "3cbb3a0f258e316b", "speakers": [{"id": 4772, "name": "Professor Mark Kibblewhite", "slug": "professor-mark-kibblewhite"}], "topics": [{"id": 1001, "name": "sustainability", "path": "/science/biology/sustainability/sustainability"}, {"id": 868, "name": "climate", "path": "/science/climatechange/climate"}, {"id": 158, "name": "sustainability", "path": "/science/biology/sustainability"}, {"id": 752, "name": "conservation", "path": "/science/naturalhistory/conservation"}], "supercategory": "science", "venue": {"id": 1212, "name": "Birkbeck, University of London", "slug": "birkbeck-university-of-london", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC1H 0PD"}, "organizer": {"id": 1069, "name": "Ecology and Conservation Studies Society", "slug": "ecology-and-conservation-studies-society"}, "date": "2007-03-02", "dates": [{"id": 3935, "from_date": "2007-03-02", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "18:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": null, "additional_info": "For any queries, please contact e-mail:   wright@britishlibrary.net;  tel:  020 7485 7903,\r\n   or contact e-mail:   h.atkinson@bbk.ac.uk ;  tel:  020 7679 1069", "members_only": "No", "members_info": "Details of the Society and application forms will be available at the door, and are on our website http://www.bbk.ac.uk/ce/environment/   [follow the link]", "venue": {"id": 1212, "name": "Birkbeck, University of London", "slug": "birkbeck-university-of-london", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC1H 0PD"}, "organizer": {"id": 1069, "name": "Ecology and Conservation Studies Society", "slug": "ecology-and-conservation-studies-society"}}]}, {"id": 3248, "title": "Heroism in War", "synopsis": "Exploring 150 years of the Victoria Cross", "keywords": "victoria cross, first world war, second world war", "body": "In celebration of the 150th anniversary of the Victoria Cross, this study morning explores heroism and the naval heroes awarded Britain’s highest gallantry medal.
