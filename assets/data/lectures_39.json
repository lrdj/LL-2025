The correspondence sent to postwar Jewish community offices and organisations reveals highly fragmentary knowledge about wartime events, both on the part of far-flung refugees and the officials who attempted to assist them. Many of these searches ended in grief but many more in 'no information located'. As a result, Jewish tracing enquiries continued to be made for years after the war and were only halted with reluctance. Some family survivors eventually did seek declarations of death for relatives who had not returned.

It is also peculiarly British in that it is deeply rooted in the British class system. This multi-million pound business dominates the hills of the north of England the Pennines, the North Yorkshire Moors, the Cheviots and throughout Scotland. Grouse shooting is big business. VERY big business And backed by powerful, wealthy lobbying groups, its tendrils run throughout British society. \r\n\r\nInglorious makes the case for banning driven grouse shooting. The facts and arguments are presented fairly but the author, Mark Avery, states from the start why he has, after many years of soul-searching, come down in favour of an outright ban. \r\n\r\nThere is too much illegal killing of wildlife, such as Buzzards, Golden Eagles, and, most egregiously of all, Hen Harriers; and, as a land use, it wrecks the ecology of the hills. However, grouse shooting is economically important, and it is a great British tradition. All of these, and other points of view, are given fair and detailed treatment and analysis and the author talks to a range of people on different sides of the debate.\r\n\r\nThe book also sets out Avery's campaign with Chris Packham to gain support for the proposal to ban grouse shooting, culminating in 'Hen Harrier Day', timed to coincide with the 'Glorious' 12th.\r\n\r\nEver-controversial, Mark Avery is guaranteed to stir up a debate about fieldsports, the countryside and big business in a book that all British conservationists will want to read.\r\n\r\n“Pacy and passionate, this is nature writing that insists you sit up and take note.” –Stephanie Cross, The Lady\r\n\r\n“This is a book you must read whether or not you support such shooting.” -Highland News Group\r\n\r\n“A powerful indictment of the grouse-shooting industry and its illegal shooting and propaganda war against the hen harrier.” –Stephen Moss, The Guardian\r\n\r\n“Mr Avery writes with a light touch and endearing self-depreciation.

What is the state of a person who acts justly, and what that of a person who acts unjustly?  Does the leading of a just life lead towards goodness? It seems that it does: but is this an intrinsic goodness, or merely good because justice leads to later rewards and injustice towards subsequent punishment?  Socrates claims that acting justly is its own reward, and in the first nine and a half books of the work, Plato is especially concerned to show that this is the case.  It is really only in the last half of the last book (the tenth), that he allows himself to consider what the consequences are of living a just or unjust life to the soul after the death of its mortal body.  Following the Pythagorean and Orphic teachings on reincarnation, Plato has Socrates tell a tale of Er, a soldier who seems to have died in battle but afterwards revives and relates how he saw the souls of the dead go to a place of judgement, and then after receiving their just rewards for the life they had led, were faced with the task of choosing a further life.  This choice, Er said, appeared to be profoundly influenced by the nature of the previous life, but especially by the wisdom (or otherwise) of the soul making the choice - for each of us needs to be able to discern the truly good life from the seemingly good life.\r\n\r\nThis evening will begin with a short talk about the Republic and Plato's Orphic inheritance; we will then read the myth of Er and leave ourselves an hour to discuss its implications.\r\n\r\nNo previous experience of formal philosophy is required.\r\n\r\nEntrance in free, but donations between £3-5 will be welcomed.\r\n\r\nA PDF download of the extract we will be reading is available on our website together with further details of this and other Prometheus Trust's activities: www.prometheustrust.co.uk (the PDF is on the \"London Monday Evenings\" page.)\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 2225, "added": "2016-03-30T14:35:55", "slug": "7c67d0615aee1773", "speakers": [{"id": 3573, "name": "  Tim Addey", "slug": "tim-addey"}], "topics": [{"id": 3310, "name": "mythology", "path": "/religion/spirituality/spiritualdevelopment/mythology"}, {"id": 1822, "name": "philosophy", "path": "/academic/religion/religion/philosophy"}, {"id": 2388, "name": "philosophy", "path": "/arts/literature/philosophy/philosophy"}, {"id": 365, "name": "platonism", "path": "/arts/philosophy/platonism"}], "supercategory": "religion", "venue": {"id": 3106, "name": "Cecil Sharp House", "slug": "cecil-sharp-house", "city": "London", "postcode": "NW1 7AY"}, "organizer": {"id": 2041, "name": "The Prometheus Trust", "slug": "the-prometheus-trust"}, "date": "2016-04-04", "dates": [{"id": 15819, "from_date": "2016-04-04", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "19:30:00", "ticket_cost": "£5 (concessions £3)", "ticket_info": "Donations at the door.", "additional_info": "Cecil Sharp House is less than 10 minutes walk from Camden Town tube, and on several bus routes.", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 3106, "name": "Cecil Sharp House", "slug": "cecil-sharp-house", "city": "London", "postcode": "NW1 7AY"}, "organizer": {"id": 2041, "name": "The Prometheus Trust", "slug": "the-prometheus-trust"}}]}, {"id": 14867, "title": "London Thinks – Trigger Warning!", "synopsis": "Should Universities be Intellectual ‘Safe Spaces’?", "keywords": "free speech, university, education, no-platforming, business", "body": "Universities are the intellectual heart of modern society.

David Cameron can simultaneously reject calls for a burqa ban as against the British tradition of tolerance, yet call for an end to the ‘passive tolerance’ of multiculturalism which permits hate speech of Islamists. Similarly, liberals proudly claim they will ‘tolerate everything except intolerance’. Yet when the accusation of ‘intolerance’ can be applied to opponents of gay marriage, footballers accused of using racist language and those who wish to send their children to a faith school, it becomes increasingly unclear how tolerance differs from respect or approval.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual tradition of tolerance emphasised the importance of moral independence, not relativism. Locke tolerated what you thought because no one could ever establish tyranny in your heart. Mill also tolerated what you did – so long as it did not harm others. And crucially he valued the existence in society of views and opinions he found objectionable, deeming them vital to the pursuit of truths which we should not assume we know. Yet today, the concept of harm can be extended to include offensive or hurtful remarks. Some even argue we should not tolerate acts which harm only ourselves: banning smoking; curbing binge drinking; warning against ‘junk’ foods. And, in the name of protecting tolerant societies from their enemies, the war on terror has justified intolerant measures – laws against incitement to terrorism or religious hatred – in many countries.\r\n\r\nDoes the concept of tolerance inevitably lead to non-judgemental indifference and moral relativism? Is it naive idealism to tolerate intolerance, or is tolerating offensive and shock part of liberty? How do the ‘tolerant’ go about challenging ideas they disapprove of or detest and can there ever be a pragmatic trade-off with security and protection from harm? Pointedly, Anthony Burgess pointedly originally gave A Clockwork Orange 21 chapters, to invoke the traditional age of majority.

Immanuel Kant sought to replace this scriptural, fideistic justification with reason. Arthur Schopenhauer, a pre-eminent neo-Kantian, pushed this sacrilege further by arguing that even Kant assumed a normative ethic, thereby endorsing a Judeo-Christian presupposition. Friedrich Nietzsche, an ardent Schopenhauerian in his youth, completed the shift by his later rejection of Schopenhauer's descriptive foundation of ethics as itself a Christian assumption.

Subsequently its use widened to include once more phenomena in politics, but also in economics, psychology and religion. Crisis today has meaning in almost every aspect of life. Is this a co-incidence or are these phenomena related in some fundamental way? It is hard to imagine a social crisis without psychological expression. But it is equally hard to imagine a psychological crisis without social roots. Is every social crisis a psycho-social one? And is every psychological crisis a psycho-social crisis too? To put it in a way which draws on its long use in medicine, is every crisis of the body a crisis of the body politic? In this event we will explore the realities and relations of the crises in our lives.\r\n\r\nThis is a great opportunity to see intellectuals from very different backgrounds engage with an important concept for our time.\r\n\r\nWe'll start with a panel discussion, followed by an informal combination of food, drink and a lively exchange of ideas.

This is in stark contrast to the important role non-vertebrates play in the functioning of our ecosystems, thereby providing the very foundations for the existence of more charismatic megafauna and humans alike.\r\n\r\nIncreasing our knowledge of the conservation status and needs of non-vertebrate groups is one of the major conservation challenges we face today.\r\n\r\nThe importance of non-vertebrate biodiversity from ecological, social and economic perspectives will be highlighted and a first preliminary overview of the conservation status of selected non-vertebrate taxa will be given. Ways in which we can fill the gaps in our current knowledge will be addressed with regard to taxonomy, conservation strategies and policies, and the prioritisation of research.

expect people, cities and places around the world to behave in identical ways.\r\n\r\nThey will be looking at sustainability from a wider cultural perspective, and incorporating local identity into the design process through a reprioritisation of human experience, senses and memory.\r\n\r\nFrancesco Bandarin, Head of World Heritage, UNESCO. \r\nIntroduced by Cecil Balmond, Ove Arup and
