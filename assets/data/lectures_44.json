The Reformation was a culmination of events and circumstances that led to a seismic shift in the religious framework of Britain. It established the image of an island nation, separate and supreme, still resonant today. It triggered a religious and political redistribution of power. It led to renewal and reform but also deep division, persecution and violence. And out of this turmoil were born the concepts of state and church as we know them today.\r\n\r\nThe 500th Anniversary of the beginning of the Reformation provides the opportunity to explore and reflect upon issues of church, state, and religious and cultural diversity that are still at the centre of our national life: the conflicts that divide, and the convictions which diverse parts of the Christian church hold sacred. How are we called to be reformed by the Gospel? How do we build the unity Christ called for with those whose convictions are very different from our own?\r\n\r\nIn this autumn lecture series we will be exploring some of those hopes and controversies.\r\n\r\nNicholas Holtam has been Bishop of Salisbury since 2011. From 1995-2011 Nick was the Vicar of SMITF where one of the things he learned is that diverse people are called into God’s kingdom. David Monteith has been Dean of Leicester since 2013. He shares long-term interests in music, poetry and the visual arts with a commitment to living with diversity. Sally Hitchiner is the Coordinating Chaplain and Interfaith Adviser for Brunel University London. She is also the founder and MD of Diverse Church.\r\n\r\nThe series is open to all.

Why is protest so ephemeral? Why does the left appear to be marginal to political life?\r\n\r\nIn an analysis which challenges our understanding of capitalism, class and ideology, Richard Seymour shows how ‘austerity’ is just one part of a wider elite plan to radically re-engineer society and everyday life in the interests of profit, consumerism and speculative finance.\r\n\r\nHowever, Seymour argues that once we turn to face the headwinds of this new reality, dispensing with reassuring dogmas, we can forge new collective resistance and alternatives to the current system. Following Brecht, ‘Against Austerity’ argues that the good old things are over, it's time to confront the bad new ones.\r\n\r\nRichard Seymour is the author of ‘Unhitched: the Trial of Christopher Hitchens’ (2012), ‘American Insurgents: A Brief History of American Anti-Imperialism’ (2012), ‘The Meaning of David Cameron’ (2010) and ‘The Liberal Defence of Murder’ (2008).

On the 50th anniversary of their sentencing, LSE hosts its official commemorative event to honour the life of Nelson Mandela. Eminent contemporaries and leading scholars of the late President of South Africa reflect on the role of law in the struggle against apartheid - and on Mandela, the lawyer. Against the dramatic backdrop of one of the most iconic trials of the twentieth century, the distinguished panellists discuss Nelson Mandela’s personal commitment to the idea of law, the role of law in the making and breaking of apartheid, and the courtroom as a stage for freedom’s greatest orator. Unbeknownst to many, Mr Mandela cared deeply about his first vocation.

Are there resources available to do both?\r\n\r\nAlong with this, major organisations and industry thought leaders are now recognising the value of association with the IPC, Sir Philip will discuss the challenge for the IPC to capitalise on this and help build a society in which people with an impairment are fully integrated.  This is the exciting opportunity the IPC is faced with, to fully enfranchise on average 10% of each country’s population with impairment through stimulating behavioural change of the other 90% and at the same time helping people with an impairment to build inspiration from the great achievements of Paralympians.\r\n\r\nSir Philip Craven has been President of the International Paralympic Committee, the global Governing Body of the Paralympic Movement since 2001 and oversaw his sixth Paralympic Games in London last year.\r\n\r\nDuring his time as IPC President, the Paralympic Movement has enjoyed significant growth and now boasts over 200 members, including 174 National Paralympic Committees across the globe. The Paralympic Games have also developed rapidly and following London 2012 they are now the third biggest sporting event in the world behind the Olympics and FIFA World Cup.\r\n\r\nIn addition to being the global head of the Paralympic Movement, Bolton born Sir Philip is an IOC Member and a Member of the British Olympic Association’s Executive Board.\r\n\r\nBefore becoming President of the IPC, Sir Philip was President of the International Wheelchair Basketball Federation having previously held roles at national and international level within the sport.\r\n\r\nHe is a five-time Paralympian having made his debut in 1972 competing in two sports - swimming and wheelchair basketball. He went on to represent Great Britain at wheelchair basketball at a further four Paralympic Games between 1976 and 1988.\r\n\r\nDuring his international wheelchair basketball career Sir Philip won the 1973 world title and two European titles in 1971 and 1974.\r\n\r\nIn 1991 he received an MBE in recognition of his services to wheelchair basketball and in 2005 was knighted for his services to Paralympic Sport.

Longevity is an asset in the neutrino business; not everyone would be so lucky.\r\n\r\nThe real genius behind our modern understanding of the neutrino missed out on three Nobel Prizes - because he fled the UK to the Soviet Union, and didn’t survive to see his theories proved.

Effective conservation depends on our ability to measure and monitor biodiversity change, and on the responses to biodiversity loss of a wide group of stakeholders and actors, including governments, local communities and the international community.\r\n\r\nA range of biodiversity indices are under development to assess progress towards the 2010 targets of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). However, whilst the 2010 targets provide an important mechanism by which to assess global biodiversity change, ensuring that appropriate monitoring systems are in place and translating monitoring results into effective conservation on the ground remains a major global challenge for a number of reasons, including financial and technical-capacity constraints, and policy and legal barriers.\r\n\r\nDeveloping a better understanding of the difficulties faced by countries in meeting their obligations under the CBD and helping bridge the gap between international commitments and local action is the major theme of this symposium. Thus, the symposium will first assess the methodologies and techniques currently available to monitor biodiversity, go on to explore those which are likely to be available in the future, and finally examine how best to ensure that biodiversity monitoring and responses to biodiversity change are incorporated effectively into policy and practice at national and local levels.\r\n\r\nThe symposium will provide a synopsis of the best current thinking on how to monitor biodiversity loss and how to ensure monitoring results have real impacts on conservation.\r\n\r\n\r\nOrganised by Sarah Durant, Nathalie Pettorelli, Ben Collen, Linda Krueger, Matthew Hatchwell and Jonathan Baillie.\r\n\r\nFor further details or to book your places, please see www.zsl.org/science/scientific-meetings/ or contact Joy Hayward, Scientific Meetings Coordinator, Zoological Society of London, Regent's Park, London NW1 4RY; tel: +44 (0)20 7449 6227; fax: +44 (0)20 7449 6411; e-mail: joy.hayward@zsl.org.", "additional_info": null, "duration": 480, "image_id": 1028, "added": "2009-05-06T04:22:11", "slug": "biodiversity-monitoring-and-conservation-a-2-day-zsl-and-wcs-joint-symposium-day-1", "speakers": [{"id": 8349, "name": "Please see link for full details", "slug": "please-see-link-for-full-details"}], "topics": [{"id": 874, "name": "population", "path": "/society/society/society/population"}, {"id": 159, "name": "biodiversity", "path": "/science/biology/biodiversity"}, {"id": 752, "name": "conservation", "path": "/science/naturalhistory/conservation"}, {"id": 924, "name": "conservation", "path": "/academic/naturalhistory/conservation"}, {"id": 676, "name": "naturalhistory", "path": "/academic/naturalhistory"}, {"id": 70, "name": "biology", "path": "/science/biology"}, {"id": 225, "name": "environment", "path": "/science/environment"}, {"id": 1105, "name": "ecology", "path": "/science/ecology"}, {"id": 1534, "name": "conservation", "path": "/science/conservation"}, {"id": 467, "name": "zoology", "path": "/science/zoology"}, {"id": 572, "name": "policy", "path": "/science/policy"}, {"id": 468, "name": "naturalhistory", "path": "/science/naturalhistory"}], "supercategory": "society", "venue": {"id": 1028, "name": "ZSL London Zoo's Meeting Rooms", "slug": "zsl-london-zoos-meeting-rooms", "city": "London", "postcode": "NW1 4RY"}, "organizer": {"id": 685, "name": "The Zoological Society of London", "slug": "the-zoological-society-of-london"}, "date": "2009-06-18", "dates": [{"id": 7033, "from_date": "2009-06-18", "to_date": "2009-06-18", "time": "8:30:00", "ticket_cost": "£130 for both days; £80 per day. 50% discount for students and ZSL members.", "ticket_info": "This is a two-day symposium to be held on Thursday 18 and Friday 19 June 2009.

Photographers shifted from the concept of 'objective', balanced and supposedly 'truthful' documentation of the news to a more personal, partisan, subjective and authored approach that reflected the paradigms of the New Journalism of the 1970s. Two bodies of work, published as books during the early 1980s, stand out as seminal in this process, Nicaragua by Susan Meiselas and Telex Iran by Gilles Peress. Both set a new precedent for how the aesthetic and formal qualities of the image could be harnessed to depict political and social events, and for how the vision and commitment of the individual could become the story itself. To coincide with the exhibition 'Recording the Truth in Iran', this talk will compare two distinctive and vital depictions of societies caught up in the turbulence of revolution.\r\n\r\nPaul Lowe is a senior lecturer in Photography at the University of the Arts London, and an award-winning photographer living and working between Sarajevo and London.

Local communities may readily sell logging rights to timber companies to fund elusive ‘development’.  Alternatively, landowners may hold the key to forest conservation.  It may be possible, if they have some notion of managing forest resources, to build on these practices.  But according to some commentators they traditionally lack a conservation ethic.  In order to advise on forest policy, it is necessary to try and gauge the practices, attitudes and ideas of local people.  This accords with current participatory development approaches to consult ‘grassroots’ opinion, as in indigenous knowledge (IK) research, which aims to facilitate interventions by promoting partnership and an awareness of local perspectives.  It is indisputable that local people will be well qualified to define problems, and will be ‘experts’ on their forests.  Regarding some problems, global Western knowledge may be irrelevant, and could even worsen make matters by overlooking aspects of the local system.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties encountered in formulating generalisations applicable on a large scale present a barrier to IK informing policy, as in the management of logging and promotion of forest conservation.  The short-termism of development, politically driven for immediate returns, presents further problems.  We need to evolve methods and formulate principles that will allow some reliable local inputs into policy debates.  One way to assess local knowledge and aspirations quickly on a nation-wide level is to use surveys.  This lecture discusses a rural community survey conducted in PNG to ascertain peoples’ attitudes to forestry, logging and conservation, and inform policy debates.  But a survey is a relatively blunt instrument for assessing the subtleties of IK, having well rehearsed drawbacks.  It also glosses over contentious political issues.  But what more effective way is there of assessing understanding and ideas widely at the grass-roots in a short time frame?\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 60, "image_id": 461, "added": "2007-09-21T14:47:41", "slug": "607d9b6f2a12ffe1", "speakers": [{"id": 5913, "name": "Professor Paul Sillitoe", "slug": "professor-paul-sillitoe"}], "topics": [{"id": 217, "name": "botany", "path": "/science/biology/botany"}, {"id": 939, "name": "plants", "path": "/leisure/gardening/plants"}, {"id": 159, "name": "biodiversity", "path": "/science/biology/biodiversity"}, {"id": 373, "name": "development", "path": "/academic/linguistics/development"}], "supercategory": "science", "venue": {"id": 1454, "name": "Jodrell Lecture Theatre (Jodrell Laboratory)", "slug": "jodrell-lecture-theatre-jodrell-laboratory", "city": "Richmond", "postcode": "TW9 3DS"}, "organizer": {"id": 1453, "name": "Sustainable Uses Group", "slug": "sustainable-uses-group"}, "date": "2007-10-09", "dates": [{"id": 4872, "from_date": "2007-10-09", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "17:00:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": null, "additional_info": "Unticketed event - lecture theatre holds 200.

He is responsible for the greatest change in the recorded history of Europe so far: the adoption and patronage by the Roman establishment of the Christian religion. He was acclaimed emperor by his troops in York on the death of his father in 306. His father's main residence had been at Trier and Constantine must have spent much time there both during and after his father's life, before he crossed the Alps with an army in 312 eventually to defeat his western rival outside Rome at the \"Battle of the Milvian Bridge\". It was in 313 that he met with his ally in the East, Licinius, in Milan. Constantinople was founded in 324 and dedicated in 330. The first ecumenical council was held at Nicaea (Iznik as now) in 325. Constantine's mother, Helena, visited the Holy Land in 326/7. Constantine finally died in 337, but then there come the Successors to Constantine!\r\n\r\nThe series of talks makes no claims to be comprehensive, but is intended to stimulate interest and provide information on this period of fundamental importance. \r\n\r\nLocation: the Holst Room.

Owen Plunkett (Ramblers' Association) will be showing how they are identifying and mapping elms and Libby Symon (Conservation Foundation) will be describing an ongoing project to grow cuttings from elm tree 'survivors'.\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 30, "image_id": 42, "added": "2004-05-04T17:05:21", "slug": "ef900564268b2255", "speakers": [{"id": 638, "name": "Dr Fred Rumsey", "slug": "dr-fred-rumsey"}, {"id": 639, "name": "Jill Butler", "slug": "jill-butler"}, {"id": 640, "name": "Owen Plunkett", "slug": "owen-plunkett"}, {"id": 641, "name": "Libby Symon", "slug": "libby-symon"}], "topics": [{"id": 218, "name": "plantidentification", "path": "/science/biology/botany/plantidentification"}, {"id": 207, "name": "conservation", "path": "/leisure/conservation"}, {"id": 206, "name": "wildlife", "path": "/leisure/wildlife"}, {"id": 336, "name": "rambling", "path": "/leisure/outdoor/rambling"}, {"id": 217, "name": "botany", "path": "/science/biology/botany"}, {"id": 159, "name": "biodiversity", "path": "/science/biology/biodiversity"}, {"id": 69, "name": "science", "path": "/science"}, {"id": 225, "name": "environment", "path": "/science/environment"}, {"id": 223, "name": "science", "path": "/society/science"}], "supercategory": "science", "venue": {"id": 156, "name": "Darwin Centre Live at the Natural History Museum", "slug": "darwin-centre-live-at-the-natural-history-museum", "city": "London", "postcode": "SW7 5BD"}, "organizer": {"id": 26, "name": "The Natural History Museum", "slug": "the-natural-history-museum"}, "date": "2004-05-20", "dates": [{"id": 523, "from_date": "2004-05-20", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "14:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": null, "additional_info": "\"website\":http://www.nhm.ac.uk/darwincentre/\r\n\r\n\"contact\":http://www.nhm.ac.uk/darwincentre/live/contact.html", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 156, "name": "Darwin Centre Live at the Natural History Museum", "slug": "darwin-centre-live-at-the-natural-history-museum", "city": "London", "postcode": "SW7 5BD"}, "organizer": {"id": 26, "name": "The Natural History Museum", "slug": "the-natural-history-museum"}}]}, {"id": 406, "title": "Join Me", "synopsis": "The international cult leader is looking for new members with his book Join Me.", "keywords": "comedy", "body": "Arrive early to avoid disappointment.", "additional_info": null, "duration": null, "image_id": 41, "added": "2004-04-18T08:42:50", "slug": "421c01ca1d49cfa9", "speakers": [{"id": 490, "name": "Danny Wallace", "slug": "danny-wallace"}], "topics": [{"id": 245, "name": "comedy", "path": "/arts/comedy"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 145, "name": "Borders", "slug": "borders", "city": "London", "postcode": "W1D 2LE"}, "organizer": {"id": 130, "name": "Borders UK Ltd", "slug": "borders-uk-ltd"}, "date": "2004-05-20", "dates": [{"id": 415, "from_date": "2004-05-20", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "6:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": null, "additional_info": null, "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 145, "name": "Borders", "slug": "borders", "city": "London", "postcode": "W1D 2LE"}, "organizer": {"id": 130, "name": "Borders UK Ltd", "slug": "borders-uk-ltd"}}]}, {"id": 161, "title": "Living without belief - Humanism in Scotland", "synopsis": "Do we need religion?
