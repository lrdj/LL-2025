The Ednams became a dynamic couple of the Bright Young Things era of the 1920s, but in July, 1930 at the peak of their chaotic life together, Rosemary met her sudden death in a horrific aeroplane crash, which also killed three of her fellow aristocrats.

Non-covalent interactions are sensitive to solvent, orientation and substituents, so to experimentally probe the basic chemistry that governs weak intermolecular interactions, we require systems where these parameters can be independently varied. This presentation will describe approaches to quantifying non-covalent interactions and the development a quantitative generic method for predicting molecular properties. Applications to understanding the behaviour of complex biological assemblies and to the design of new supramolecular nanotechnology will be discussed.\r\nBiography:\r\nChris Hunter was born in New Zealand in 1965.  He grew up in Northern Ireland and was educated at the University of Cambridge, graduating with a PhD in 1989.  He was a lecturer at the University of Otago from 1989 till 1991, when he moved to the University of Sheffield.  He was promoted to a personal chair in 1997, and in 2014, he took up the Herchel Smith Professorship of Organic Chemistry at the University of Cambridge. In 2008, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society and an Honorary Member of the Royal Irish Academy in 2015.\r\nHe has research interests in various aspects of molecular recognition: design, synthesis, measurement and theory. The aim of his research is to unravel and dissect the fundamental forces governing the complex process of intermolecular interaction in chemistry, materials science and biology. The approach is to use simple models to the design and study new experimental systems that directly probe the validity of theory.  He has built a quantitative understanding of some key aspects of molecular recognition in solution and applied the general principles derived from chemical systems to understand the behaviour and functional properties of more complex biological systems.", "additional_info": null, "duration": 120, "image_id": 2478, "added": "2016-03-10T14:49:56", "slug": "d2113edc466a71ea", "speakers": [{"id": 16068, "name": "Professor Christopher A  Hunter ", "slug": "professor-christopher-a-hunter"}], "topics": [{"id": 170, "name": "newtopic", "path": "/science/chemistry/biochemistry/catalysis/newtopic"}, {"id": 1018, "name": "talk", "path": "/arts/education/debate/talk"}, {"id": 169, "name": "catalysis", "path": "/science/chemistry/biochemistry/catalysis"}], "supercategory": "science", "venue": {"id": 3290, "name": "Anatomy Lecture Theatre", "slug": "anatomy-lecture-theatre", "city": "London", "postcode": "SE1 1UL"}, "organizer": {"id": 3200, "name": "Digital and Events, King's College London", "slug": "digital-and-events-kings-college-london"}, "date": "2016-03-23", "dates": [{"id": 15798, "from_date": "2016-03-23", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "16:00:00", "ticket_cost": "FREE", "ticket_info": "Registration URL:\r\nhttp://burtonlecture2016.eventbrite.co.uk", "additional_info": null, "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 3290, "name": "Anatomy Lecture Theatre", "slug": "anatomy-lecture-theatre", "city": "London", "postcode": "SE1 1UL"}, "organizer": {"id": 3200, "name": "Digital and Events, King's College London", "slug": "digital-and-events-kings-college-london"}}]}, {"id": 15100, "title": "Mountains, magmas and mushes", "synopsis": "Discover how we now think magma is supplied to volcanoes, and the implications for eruption frequency and prediction.", "keywords": "Earth Science\r\nEngineering\r\nGeology\r\nvolcano ", "body": "Professor Matthew Jackson, TOTAL Chair of Geological Fluid Mechanics, Dept. of Earth Science and Engineering, Imperial College London.\r\n\r\nRecent research is challenging the traditional model of volcano plumbing.

Sarkissian’s practice typically explores one theme or place through an extended body of work. The subjects of his photographs are often unpopulated spaces that evoke the traces of history and memory, simultaneously exploring what is seen and what is not seen. During this artists talk Sarkissian and Mavlian will discuss the ways in which the artist uses photography to re-evaluate larger historical, religious or socio-political narratives.\r\n\r\nThis event will also see the launch of  Sarkissian’s new artist book entitled Background. The book was selected as part of Art Basel Crowdfunding Initiative which raised funds to make the publication possible. Reflecting on the disappearing tradition of studio portraiture in the Middle East, this important publication features Sarkissian’s photographs of empty, staged studio backdrops across six Middle Eastern cities: Alexandria, Amman, Beirut, Byblos, Cairo and Istanbul. These backdrops, absent of their sitters, become symbols of lost traditions, cultural identity and time; eulogies to a certain period within a society and celebrations of portraiture as an art form, and of these spaces, which can no longer be found.\r\n\r\nShoair Mavlian works on exhibitions, acquisitions and displays at Tate Modern focusing primarily on photography. She has curated the major exhibition Conflict, Time, Photography (2014), which includes Sarkissian’s work, and Project Space: A Chronicle of Interventions (2014). She has also worked on many of the photography displays of the permanent collection across Tate Modern including Harry Callahan (2013) and New Documentary Forms (2011). She also researches photography acquisitions for the international collection.\r\n\r\nHrair Sarkissian (b. 1973, Damascus, Syria) has exhibited widely internationally in both group and solo shows including Tate Modern (London); New Museum (New York); Darat Al Funun (Amman); Mori Art Museum (Tokyo); SALT Beyoglu (Istanbul); Thessaloniki Biennale; Sharjah Biennial; Istanbul Biennial; Asia Pacific Triennial (Brisbane) among many others.

David Papineau will speak about the way that high-level sport requires intentional mental control of reflex behaviour, and will reflect on what this tells us about both cognition and sport. \r\n\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 732, "added": "2012-09-22T12:03:52", "slug": "2db31196e52512e4", "speakers": [{"id": 3159, "name": "Dr  Simon Glendinning", "slug": "dr-simon-glendinning"}, {"id": 794, "name": "Professor David Papineau", "slug": "professor-david-papineau"}, {"id": 12889, "name": "Michael  Brearley", "slug": "michael-brearley"}], "topics": [{"id": 170, "name": "newtopic", "path": "/science/chemistry/biochemistry/catalysis/newtopic"}, {"id": 1822, "name": "philosophy", "path": "/academic/religion/religion/philosophy"}, {"id": 2388, "name": "philosophy", "path": "/arts/literature/philosophy/philosophy"}, {"id": 910, "name": "science", "path": "/arts/film/documentary/science"}], "supercategory": "science", "venue": {"id": 2113, "name": "Sheikh Zayed Theatre", "slug": "sheikh-zayed-theatre", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC2A 2AE"}, "organizer": {"id": 1287, "name": "London School of Economics & Political Science", "slug": "london-school-of-economics-political-science"}, "date": "2012-11-08", "dates": [{"id": 12026, "from_date": "2012-11-08", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "18:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": "This event is free and open to all with no ticket required.

Set in late Renaissance Prague, Wegener’s film shows the creation of a golem, an artificial human being from clay, according to medieval Jewish mysticism. As the being assumes a life of its own and stalks the ghetto, we witness the unfolding of forbidden desires between Christian and Jew, monster and human. The talk will trace how Wegener, by invoking Shelley’s Frankenstein, portrays the gentile’s image of the Jews’ essentially ‘different’ body and soul. The film seems to anticipate the doomed project of the German-Jewish symbiosis.\r\n\r\nCathy Gelbin is Senior Lecturer in German at the University of Manchester. She specializes in German-Jewish culture, Holocaust Studies, gender and film. Her new monograph The Golem Returns: From German Romantic Literature to Global Jewish Culture is forthcoming in 2010 (University of Michigan Press).\r\n \r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 60, "image_id": null, "added": "2010-10-11T20:15:44", "slug": "monstrous-desires-jewish-christian-boundary-crossings-in-paul-wegeners-the-golem-germany-1920", "speakers": [{"id": 10354, "name": "Dr Cathy Gelbin", "slug": "dr-cathy-gelbin"}], "topics": [{"id": 1482, "name": "history", "path": "/religion/judaism/history"}, {"id": 2293, "name": "jews", "path": "/society/ethnicity/jews"}], "supercategory": "religion", "venue": {"id": 2165, "name": "Wiener Library", "slug": "wiener-library", "city": "London", "postcode": "W1W 5LB"}, "organizer": {"id": 2155, "name": "Leo Baeck Institute London", "slug": "leo-baeck-institute-london"}, "date": "2010-10-21", "dates": [{"id": 9345, "from_date": "2010-10-21", "to_date": "2010-10-21", "time": "19:00:00", "ticket_cost": "free", "ticket_info": "Admission to this lecture is free but places are limited and must be reserved in advance by contacting the Leo Baeck Institute: email info@leobaeck.co.uk or phone 020 7580 3493.", "additional_info": "Lectures begin promptly at 7pm.

A recent education minister infamously dismissed ‘the medieval concept of a community of scholars seeking truth’ as a ‘bit dodgy’. The scholar ensconced in a library, surrounded by dusty books, has given way to the a results-focused researcher, contributing to the economic and social well-being of the nation. This goes beyond the traditional two cultures divide: ‘curiosity-driven’ arts and humanities research and pure science are both belittled as self-indulgent, trumped by ‘impact’ projects. Some fear now universities are just part of Lord Peter Mandelson’s super-ministry, whose title contains neither the word education nor universities, every academic will be beholden to business. Already intellectual inquiry is justified in terms of outcomes and consequences. Scholars must prove themselves as social-includers, skills-brokers, community coherers and contributors to UK Plc, and demonstrate how their subjects make students employable. \r\n\r\nBut are these trends as philistine as critics imply? Perhaps it is mere romanticism to yearn for the days of bumbling boffins. The modern world faces urgent problems that cannot be resolved in musty archives. As the competition for public funding intensifies, surely publicly-funded scholars have an obligation to make their work relevant. And the fact that all political parties share an enthusiasm for evidence-based policy surely shows at last they value academics’ contribution to society. \r\n\r\nIs evidence-based research in the humanities and social science inching out theoretical work? Is output-driven research in the sciences limiting experimentation and serendipitous discovery? Or will the ‘new’ targeted research mean less waste and more public support for academics’ work? Is scholarship still essential to ‘an university of knowledges’, where ideas about what it means to be human are developed and contested?

Meanwhile, regenerative medicine has been progressing rapidly and is nearing clinical applicability to a wide range of specific conditions.\r\n\r\nI argue that we are approaching the point where regenerative medicine can be used against ageing. This would entail not retarding but actually reversing the accumulation of damage. If successful, this would obviously be a far more valuable technology than mere slowing of ageing. However, in order to be successful it must be comprehensive, and some aspects of aging may seem impossible to address in this way. I shall survey the main examples and argue that the ones which contribute to age-related ill-health are, in fact, realistic targets of regenerative interventions.\r\n\r\nDr. Aubrey de Grey is a biomedical gerontologist based in Cambridge, UK, and is the Chief Science Officer of SENS Foundation, a non-profit charity dedicated to combating the ageing process. He is also Editor-in-Chief of Rejuvenation Research, the world’s highest-impact peer-reviewed journal focused on intervention in ageing. His research interests encompass the causes of all the accumulating and eventually pathogenic molceular and cellular side-effects of metabolism (“damage”) that constitute mammalian aging and the design of interventions to repair and/or obviate that damage. He has developed a possibly comprehensive plan for such repair, termed Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence (SENS), which breaks aging down into seven major classes of damage and identifies detailed approaches to addressing each one. A key aspect of SENS is that it can potentially extend healthy lifespan without limit, even though these repair processes will probably never be perfect, as the repair only needs to approach perfection rapidly enough to keep the overall level of damage below pathogenic levels. Dr. de Grey has termed this required rate of improvement of repair therapies “longevity escape velocity”.", "additional_info": null, "duration": 180, "image_id": 778, "added": "2009-08-17T03:03:39", "slug": "af309fe4e4718c7d", "speakers": [{"id": 4531, "name": "Dr Aubrey de Grey", "slug": "dr-aubrey-de-grey"}], "topics": [{"id": 1397, "name": "medicine", "path": "/academic/science/philosophy/engineering/biology/medicine"}, {"id": 170, "name": "newtopic", "path": "/science/chemistry/biochemistry/catalysis/newtopic"}, {"id": 1018, "name": "talk", "path": "/arts/education/debate/talk"}, {"id": 1512, "name": "medicine", "path": "/society/history/georgian/medicine"}], "supercategory": "academic", "venue": {"id": 1441, "name": "The Penderels Oak", "slug": "the-penderels-oak", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC1V 7HP"}, "organizer": {"id": 1319, "name": "The Skeptic Magazine", "slug": "the-skeptic-magazine"}, "date": "2009-08-17", "dates": [{"id": 7304, "from_date": "2009-08-17", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "19:30:00", "ticket_cost": "£2 donation", "ticket_info": "Register here:\r\nhttp://skeptic.org.uk/events/details/?xref=18", "additional_info": "Please book via the web-form.

As is recognized in the recently published Stern Report, there is a need for us to take action as soon as possible.  In this spirit, in May 2007, Guidelines about climate change adaptation were published by the UK Biodiversity Partnership, and it is the aim of this talk to explain the ideas and ecological principles which lie behind the guidelines.\r\nIt is foreseen in the guidelines that protected areas such as Sites of Special Scientific Interest will change with climate, but conserving these and other areas of high quality wildlife habitat will be essential.\r\nLocally maintaining and enhancing landscape variety in terms of vegetation structure, slope, aspect and other features will be required.  Changes in land use will also be needed if we are to create landscapes with the connectivity and ecological networks that will allow the less mobile species to disperse in response to climate change.\r\nSome of our greatest challenges are on the coast, due to sea level rise, and in the management of rivers, where increased flood risk is predicted.  A number of issues affecting habitat management can be identified, including the need to rethink time of year at which grazing and cutting are carried out and increased fire risks.\r\nOne of our greatest challenges is understanding which part of biodiversity change is due to climate change and which part is due to factors such as eutrophication; otherwise our conservation strategies will be ineffective.  We will also need to adopt more flexible conservation targets unless we are to use resources unwisely.\r\n\r\nDr John Hopkins’ background is in Botany - a youthful amateur who went on to read Plant Science at King's College London.

His first job was with the Nature Conservancy Council as \"Assistant Regional Officer\" for County Durham at a time when there were so few of them they could nearly hold their regional meetings in a phone box.  This included responsibility for Upper Teesdale with its relict arctic alpine flora, so he has had experience of areas which may show markedly different responses to climate change.

Under certain conditions\r\nan imbalance can develop between the antioxidant defences and the formation of ROS. The resulting accumulation of ROS, called oxidative stress, enables them to interact with physiological mediators in the body. Such an interaction inactivates those mediators and can result in the formation of toxic products. An example of this is nitric oxide (NO), a blood vessel dilator and anti-thrombotic agent generated in the lining of blood vessels, which reacts with superoxide anion (O2-). This interaction inactivates NO, leading to a condition in which the blood vessels fail to respond normally to the beneficial stimuli of the blood vessel dilators. This condition is predictive of cardiovascular disease and occurs in subjects with risk factors but no overt symptoms of disease. The reaction between NO and O2- also leads to the formation of peroxynitrite, a powerful oxidant species that has been implicated in conditions such as hypercholesterolaemia, diabetes and coronary artery disease. Another example is prostacyclin, the generation of which is decreased by lipid peroxides produced by the interaction between normal lipids in the body and ROS.", "additional_info": null, "duration": 60, "image_id": null, "added": "2006-01-28T14:51:49", "slug": "7c507101674f8bc4", "speakers": [{"id": 1744, "name": "Prof Salvador Moncada", "slug": "prof-salvador-moncada"}], "topics": [{"id": 289, "name": "medicine", "path": "/science/medicine"}, {"id": 509, "name": "medicine", "path": "/academic/medicine"}, {"id": 406, "name": "health", "path": "/society/health"}, {"id": 162, "name": "research", "path": "/science/research"}], "supercategory": "science", "venue": {"id": 201, "name": "UCL", "slug": "ucl", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC1E 6BT"}, "organizer": {"id": 2, "name": "The Royal Institution of Great Britain", "slug": "the-royal-institution-of-great-britain"}, "date": "2006-03-17", "dates": [{"id": 2901, "from_date": "2006-03-17", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "20:00:00", "ticket_cost": "£12 (Free for Ri Members)", "ticket_info": "The Ri Events Team on 020 7409 2992 or www.rigb.org", "additional_info": "In associations with UCL.", "members_only": "No", "members_info": "Ri Members get money off all tickets and other benefits.

He also made two other breakthroughs in different areas of physics (quantum mechanics and Brownian motion) in the same year. One hundred years later, a panel of scientists and communicators discuss Einstein's impact in science and beyond. The panel includes: Professor Sir Michael Berry, a theoretical physicist at Bristol University; Dr Jim\r\nAl-Khalili and Dr Mark Lythgoe, co-presenters of \"Einstein's Brain\"; Professor Sir John Enderby, President of the Institute of Physics and other special guests. Chaired by Dr Peter Rodgers, Editor of Physics World\r\nMagazine.\r\n\r\nAnimated Einstein\r\nSat 2 April  1500hrs  Waterside 3\r\nThird year animators from UWE were approached by the Institute of Physics to produce an animation celebrating the centenary of Einstein’s remarkable year of 1905. The brief was to explore the popularisation of some difficult science principles to a non-scientific community through\r\nanimation. This is a chance to experience on the big screen the students’ response to the work of Einstein throughout his extraordinary career. This screening will be introduced by John Parry, Lecturer in Animation at the University of the West of England.\r\nThis event is free – please collect a ticket from Box Office on the day.\r\n\r\nRiddles Of The Dead: The Secret Of Einstein's Brain\r\nSat 2 April  1600hrs  Waterside 3\r\nDirs: Jim Al-Khalili/ Mark Lythgoe 1hr\r\nIn life, Albert Einstein's brain was\r\nthe source of the most influential scientific ideas of the modern era. Now, nearly 50 years after his death, does the extraordinary rediscovery of one of the greatest brains in history hold the key to unlock the nature of genius? Neurophysiologist, Dr. Mark Lythgoe and physicist Dr Jim Al-Khalili set out on a quest to reveal the secrets of Einstein's genius.

Donnie is an emotionally disturbed high school heartthrob haunted by visions of a 6-foot-tall demonic rabbit called Frank. In this version, Kelly has made some attempt to explain formerly cryptic details of the film's plot (especially the time travel sequences) without compromising its indefinable and compelling weirdness.
