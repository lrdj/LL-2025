Is it what we perceive with the senses? Or perception with some added element of the mind? Or is it beyond this?\r\n\r\nSince so much of human activity arises from our grasp of knowledge – and sometimes our lack of it – it would seem to be essential for us to understand what knowledge is, and how it is to be obtained.  Further, we should acknowledge the difference between belief and knowledge if we don't want to fall into the trap of thinking we know when we only believe.  In the Theaetetus Plato broaches these matters as Socrates explores with an intelligent young man the central question, what is knowledge? Although the dialogue itself ends inconclusively, it introduces important concepts which are especially useful to the thinker in the light of contemporary assumption about knowledge and opinion. We will read some extracts from the dialogue, and give ourselves an hour to explore the emerging issues. This is the first of two evenings in which knowledge as understood by the Platonic tradition will be discussed: the second (on July 10th) will centre of Plato's Sophist in which he moves us closer to a position where we can draw clearer conclusions.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo previous experience of formal philosophy is required.\r\n\r\nEntrance in free, but donations between £3-5 will be welcomed.\r\n\r\nA PDF

The digital archive currently holds a collection of more than 6,000 digitalized private and family photographs and around 280 recorded testimonies in an audio-video and textual formats. Therefore, the exhibition can be viewed as wider historical, cultural, social and technological progression through the everyday life of a society at the beginning of the 20th century.\r\n\r\nFollowing a brief history of photography at the first half of the 20th century, the exhibition opens up a dialogue on the ways in which personal histories, memory and photography tell a story that are testaments to humanity. The exhibition also explores private photographs which were taken during the Holocaust by families who went into hiding in their home country or as tourists abroad. These photographs, often made as snapshots or holiday photos - landscape or cityscape shots, increase in contrast when we know the context of the image.\r\n\r\nFor further information about this project:\r\nhttps://vimeo.com/129824379 \r\nhttps://vimeo.com/122359711\r\n\r\nAndrea Palašti is a visual artist, independent curator and lecturer, based in Novi Sad, Serbia.

A race that was supposedly ‘neck-and-neck’ and heading for a hung Parliament resulted in the first majority Conservative government since 1992.\r\n\r\n-- So how did a fragmented political system actually deliver single party government and what are the consequences for the future of the British political system?\r\n\r\n-- Can the Conservative performance be explained by the ‘black widow effect’? And if so, having devoured the Lib Dems, what does the future now hold for David Cameron and his party given the structural problems it still faces and with an electorate whose support for it remains cagey and contingent?\r\n\r\n-- Despite ideological and political incoherence are there still significant opportunities for Labour to exploit in the future? Might brand distinctiveness help nullify the Conservative advantages on economic competence and leadership?\r\n\r\n-- What now for UKIP? Will the issue of immigration continue to exacerbate the break-down of the British party system?\r\n\r\n-- And what of the polls?

We now know quite a lot about which parts of the brain are used when we empathise and how empathy grows in typically developing children. We also know that hormones in the womb, specific genes, and your early environment all influence how much empathy you have. There are several ways in which one can lose one’s empathy, and this is clearly seen in psychiatric conditions such as personality disorders. However, there is one condition, autism, which not only entails difficulties with empathy but can lead to a talent in ‘systemising’. Systemising is the aptitude to spot patterns in the world. Why should losing your empathy render you better at systemising? And can aspects of empathy be taught if a child is having difficulty developing it? Does the discovery that there may be ‘genes for empathy’ imply that empathy is the result of our evolution?", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": null, "added": "2010-08-18T10:26:19", "slug": "empathy-and-the-human-brain", "speakers": [{"id": 614, "name": "Dr Simon Baron-Cohen", "slug": "dr-simon-baron-cohen"}], "topics": [{"id": 69, "name": "science", "path": "/science"}], "supercategory": "science", "venue": {"id": 2, "name": "The Royal Institution of Great Britain", "slug": "the-royal-institution-of-great-britain", "city": "London", "postcode": "W1S 4BS"}, "organizer": {"id": 2, "name": "The Royal Institution of Great Britain", "slug": "the-royal-institution-of-great-britain"}, "date": "2010-09-24", "dates": [{"id": 9029, "from_date": "2010-09-24", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "19:45:00", "ticket_cost": "Free to Ri Full Members/ £10 Associate Members", "ticket_info": "www.rigb.org", "additional_info": null, "members_only": "Yes", "members_info": "Available through the website, www.rigb.org.\r\n", "venue": {"id": 2, "name": "The Royal Institution of Great Britain", "slug": "the-royal-institution-of-great-britain", "city": "London", "postcode": "W1S 4BS"}, "organizer": {"id": 2, "name": "The Royal Institution of Great Britain", "slug": "the-royal-institution-of-great-britain"}}]}, {"id": 8584, "title": "Occupational Asthma Workshop  ", "synopsis": "Addresses issues in the diagnosis of occupational asthma and work-exacerbated asthma, including workplace surveillance.

Exponent of a distinct magical gnosis and writer of many books, he has produced a formidable and highly creative body of work, expressing approaches which have evolved throughout the years. At the heart of this work is the series of Typhonian Trilogies, commencing with The Magical Revival in 1972 and culminating in The Ninth Arch in 2002. In this talk Michael Staley will discuss the fundamental aspects of this work, as well as the ways in which Grant set out to develop Thelema and creative occultism in the light of the Typhonian or Draconian Current.\r\n\r\nGrant’s work has grown out of an extraordinary life. He had a passion for magic, mysticism and comparative religion by the time he met Aleister Crowley in 1944 -- a contact which made a profound impact upon him. Later, he and his wife had a close association with the occult artist Austin Osman Spare. Spare’s work also had a huge influence upon Grant, but it was through his own magical and mystical experience that Grant was able to assimilate the work of these two and many others including Woodroffe, Massey, Blavatsky, and Lovecraft to form a vision that suffuses all his work but finds its most profound flowering in the Typhonian Trilogies.\r\n\r\nThis lecture focuses on Grant’s work as expressed in the Typhonian Trilogies, and lays the foundation for a forthcoming series of talks which will focus more closely on specific elements of his work.\r\n\r\nMichael Staley is a prominent member of the magical order headed by Kenneth Grant, edits the well-respected journal ‘Starfire’, and is the founder of Starfire Publishing Ltd.

And why barricades built of concrete, steel and barbed wire when threats to the nation today are so often miniaturized, vaporous, clandestine, dispersed or networked? Why walls now and how are they to be understood?\r\n\r\nWhile acknowledging variety in the explicit purposes of the new walls, this project argues for comprehending the recent spate of wall building in terms of eroded nation-state sovereignty. As walls permit infiltration by much of what they formally interdict, confound the very distinction between law and lawlessness represented by the nation state, and both highlight and exacerbate tensions between global flows (of labor, goods, ideas, peoples, and finance) and national anxieties, walls also reveal a theological dimension of sovereignty, register theatrical and contradictory dimensions of sovereign decline, and project a (false and untenable) imago of sovereign power. Above all, the new walls consecrate the boundary corruption they overtly contest and signify the ungovernability by law of a range of forces unleashed by globalization. \r\n\r\nWendy Brown is Professor of Political Science at the University of California, Berkeley. Her fields of interest include the history of political theory, nineteenth and twentieth century Continental theory, critical theory, and cultural theory (including feminist theory, critical race theory, and postcolonial theory).

Ken Pounds, Professor of Space Physics at the University of Leicester and former President of the Royal Astronomical Society(RAS), is a pioneer in X-ray astronomy and has worked on a variety of international space missions studying the giant black holes lurking in the centre of many, perhaps all, galaxies. His initial interest in science was awakened at the neighbouring grammar school in Yorkshire, attended – years earlier – by another former President of the RAS, Sir Fred Hoyle. His education continued with a physics degree at University College London, followed by a PhD in the newly-formed Rocket Research Group. The following two decades were a period of exploration, viewing the sky with X-ray ‘eyes’ to see what – if anything – was there. The ‘X-ray sky’ turned out to be very rich, and as is often the case in astronomy, gravity emerged as the dominant force at work. Before long, X-ray observations from increasingly sophisticated space missions revealed clear evidence for the ultimate gravitational bodies, black holes.

Is dreaming that important, and who has the greater fantasies - the dreamer or the dream interpreter? The acid test of insufficient sleep is excessive daytime sleepiness, but many insomniacs don't complain of this - why? These are some of the questions that Jim Horne will attempt to cover in his illustrated talk on a subject that still fascinates him.\r\n\r\nAlthough we can’t deny the importance of sleep - what can science tell us about dreaming? We already know that dreams are more frequently recalled from Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep, a type of sleep in which the brain is as active as when awake. Mark Blagrove will describe the effects of waking life on dream content, the relationships between personality and dream recall, and what the differences are between dreams in REM sleep and dreams from the other stages of sleep. There is some evidence that REM sleep is involved in the formation of memories, Mark will also address whether the dreams that accompany REM sleep also have a function and how dreaming and nightmares are currently investigated scientifically. \r\n\r\n\r\nJoin Dr Mark Blagrove (University of Wales, Swansea) and Prof Jim Horne (Director of the Sleep Research Centre, Loughborough University) for this eye opening discussion!\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 120, "added": "2004-08-04T09:24:08", "slug": "3d25b0d553d66a20", "speakers": [{"id": 1359, "name": "Professor Jim Horne", "slug": "professor-jim-horne"}, {"id": 1360, "name": "Prof. Mark Blagrove", "slug": "prof-mark-blagrove"}], "topics": [{"id": 147, "name": "brain", "path": "/science/biology/brain"}, {"id": 407, "name": "stress", "path": "/society/health/stress"}, {"id": 149, "name": "brain", "path": "/science/psychology/brain"}, {"id": 69, "name": "science", "path": "/science"}, {"id": 162, "name": "research", "path": "/science/research"}], "supercategory": "science", "venue": {"id": 2, "name": "The Royal Institution of Great Britain", "slug": "the-royal-institution-of-great-britain", "city": "London", "postcode": "W1S 4BS"}, "organizer": {"id": 2, "name": "The Royal Institution of Great Britain", "slug": "the-royal-institution-of-great-britain"}, "date": "2004-09-28", "dates": [{"id": 1166, "from_date": "2004-09-28", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "19:00:00", "ticket_cost": "£8 standard, £5 concessions", "ticket_info": "www.rigb.org\r\n020 7409 2992", "additional_info": "Nearest tube: Green Park", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 2, "name": "The Royal Institution of Great Britain", "slug": "the-royal-institution-of-great-britain", "city": "London", "postcode": "W1S 4BS"}, "organizer": {"id": 2, "name": "The Royal Institution of Great Britain", "slug": "the-royal-institution-of-great-britain"}}]}, {"id": 1103, "title": "Photographer's Talk: Guy Raz", "synopsis": "Photographer Guy Raz with writer and critic Andrew Renton", "keywords": "Photography Arts Politics", "body": "As part of The Mediterranean exhibition, Israeli photographer Guy Raz discusses his work and the Lifeguard Towers project taken on the shores of Gaza and Tel Aviv.
