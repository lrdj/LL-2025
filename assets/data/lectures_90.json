How do you negotiate living in a home which might be ‘co-habited’ by the strangest form of stranger?\r\n\r\nGeographer Dr Caron Lipman decided to find out through a series of interviews with inhabitants of ‘haunted homes’ in England and Wales – all of whom had experienced some form of ‘uncanny’ event\r\n\r\nCaron will offer some examples and insights from her case studies, describing how such experiences are interpreted, how far the experience of uncanny events challenges existing beliefs (or non-beliefs) in ghosts, and what these events reveal about the domestic interior.\r\n\r\nSarah Sparkes – The GHost in the story\r\n\r\n“I immediately knew it was someone in spirit form, because I could see my favourite poster of Michael Jackson right through her body.”\r\n\r\nArtist, curator and ghost enthusiast Sarah Sparkes talks about some of the fascinating, contemporary ghost stories she has collected and archived at London’s Senate House, Liverpool and Taiwan.\r\n\r\nSarah Sparkes leads the visual arts and creative research project GHost. She was recently awarded Arts Council funding for her project to archive Liverpool ghost stories. Her artwork The GHost Formula, 2016, commissioned by FACT (Foundation for Art and Creative Technology) recently toured to NTMoFA (National Taiwan Museum of Fine Arts) as part of the exhibition No Such Thing As Gravity curated by Rob la Frenais.

The tradition was rooted in a pagan veneration of polytheistic Gods, while at the same time it recognized a singular First Principle – a transcending First God. How are we to understand this theological framework, so strange to the modern mind? Is a recognition of the Gods an optional extra in Platonic philosophy – an element we can eliminate without damage to its metaphysical and ethical structures? In what way do the mythological tales of Gods and heroes both reveal and obscure the part played by the Gods in Platonic philosophy? Can we look behind the vivid and beautiful stories and find the truths which so inspired the sages of the ancient tradition?\r\n\r\nIn a series of three linked evenings we will look at number of passages from the writings of some of the finest thinkers of the tradition with a view to seeing again the world with their eyes – perhaps to the point at which we can say with them \"all things are full of the Gods.\" Each of the three evenings will begin with a short introduction to an aspect of the subject and then move on to the extracts to be read: we should have at least an hour to discuss the ideas arising from these passages.

But the East Berlin Series charts the progress of a society like ours to one with more utopian properties; it maps the changes, the successes and failures of a society navigating by the light of utopian ideals.\r\n\r\nMax Hertzberg, onetime Stasi files researcher and more recently a social change trainer and facilitator.\r\nStealing the Future is his debut novel, having previously co-written and edited A Consensus Handbook and How to Set Up a Workers’ Co-operative.\r\n\r\nBetween research trips to Berlin and Eastern Europe, Max is working on the next book in the East Berlin trilogy (working title: Thoughts are Free, due out in Autumn 2016).

The superb performance of CMS since high energy collisions began at the LHC is testimony to his foresight, expertise and appreciation of the complex interplay of techniques which are needed for such success.\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 120, "image_id": null, "added": "2013-05-27T17:35:17", "slug": "071ddbec9f8c9911", "speakers": [{"id": 13796, "name": "Professor Tejinder  Virdee", "slug": "professor-tejinder-virdee"}], "topics": [{"id": 170, "name": "newtopic", "path": "/science/chemistry/biochemistry/catalysis/newtopic"}, {"id": 778, "name": "engineering", "path": "/science/engineering/engineering/engineering"}, {"id": 1395, "name": "engineering", "path": "/academic/science/philosophy/engineering"}, {"id": 910, "name": "science", "path": "/arts/film/documentary/science"}], "supercategory": "science", "venue": {"id": 1220, "name": "Friends of Imperial College", "slug": "friends-of-imperial-college", "city": "London", "postcode": "SW7 2AZ"}, "organizer": {"id": 1220, "name": "Friends of Imperial College", "slug": "friends-of-imperial-college"}, "date": "2013-06-04", "dates": [{"id": 13091, "from_date": "2013-06-04", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "19:00:00", "ticket_cost": "£3 - £10", "ticket_info": "http://www.friendsofimperial.org.uk/FOIC-Index.php?pg=FullEvent&from=Our-Events&ev=109\r\n\r\n", "additional_info": null, "members_only": "No", "members_info": "www.friendsofimperial.org.uk\r\nadmin@friendsofimperial.org.uk\r\n020 3239 7699", "venue": {"id": 1220, "name": "Friends of Imperial College", "slug": "friends-of-imperial-college", "city": "London", "postcode": "SW7 2AZ"}, "organizer": {"id": 1220, "name": "Friends of Imperial College", "slug": "friends-of-imperial-college"}}]}, {"id": 12461, "title": "The fast trauma (PTSD) and phobia cure (Two day course)", "synopsis": "Even the most severe phobic and post-traumatic stress (PTSD) symptoms can be quickly and safely treated with the precisely targeted skills taught on this two-day master course.", "keywords": "trauma, PTSD, post traumatic stress, anxiety, depression, counselling skills, psychotherapy, therapy, mental health", "body": "Even the most severe phobic and post-traumatic stress (PTSD) symptoms can be quickly and safely treated with the precisely targeted skills taught on this two-day master course.

It is also invaluable for helping people with phobias, those who have suffered persistent physical or sexual abuse, and people with OCD.

BBC Radio 4 will be recording a debate between modern day followers of Keynes and Hayek.  \r\n\r\nGeorge Selgin is Professor of Economics at The Terry College of Business, University of Georgia. Selgin is one of the founders of the Modern Free Banking School, which draws its inspiration from the writings of Hayek on the denationalization of money and choice in currency. He has written extensively on free banking, the private supply of money and deflation. George Selgin is the author of The Theory of Free Banking: Money Supply under Competitive Note Issue (1988), Less Than Zero: The Case for a Falling Price Level in a Growing Economy (1997), and Good Money: Birmingham Button Makers, the Royal Mint, and the Beginnings of Modern Coinage (2008). \r\n\r\nRobert Skidelsky is Emeritus Professor of Political Economy at the University of Warwick.

He is the author of The World After Communism (1995) (American edition called The Road from Serfdom). He was made a life peer in 1991, and was elected Fellow of the British Academy in 1994.

Since a further 21% of the Universe is made up from invisible ‘Cold Dark Matter’ that can only be detected through its gravitational effects, the ordinary atomic matter making up the rest is apparently only 4% of the total cosmic budget.  \r\n\r\nThese discoveries require a shift in our perception as great as that made after Copernicus’s revelation that the Earth moves around the Sun.

On average, two randomly chosen Britons of European descent are sixth cousins, with their common ancestor alive in Darwin's day. Darwin himself was worried about the effects of close intermarriage, for he married his own first cousin. This lecture will talk about sex, about how inbreeding is an escape from true sexual reproduction, about how some creatures abandon sex altogether - and about how mating within the family is still surprisingly common in some populations (including some within Britain) although it may, at last, be on the way out.\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 60, "image_id": 1431, "added": "2010-09-16T13:30:15", "slug": "ucl-lunch-hour-lecture", "speakers": [{"id": 1630, "name": "Professor Steve Jones", "slug": "professor-steve-jones"}], "topics": [], "supercategory": "academic", "venue": {"id": 201, "name": "UCL", "slug": "ucl", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC1E 6BT"}, "organizer": {"id": 201, "name": "UCL", "slug": "ucl"}, "date": "2010-10-12", "dates": [{"id": 9243, "from_date": "2010-10-12", "to_date": "2010-10-12", "time": "13:15:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": "UCL Lunch Hour Lectures are free and open to all.

And yet the public response to these issues seems inconsistent. Attempts to defend the privacy interests of MPs over their expenses claims are met with suspicion. But there is also great resistance to sacrificing individuals’ privacy for the sake of security. We are hostile to journalistic intrusion, and yet place a high value placed on investigative journalism which arguably would be undermined by stringent privacy laws.\r\n\r\nWhat is needed is greater public engagement with issues of privacy, and with the complexity of forming consistent, principled public policy. This public event seeks to address this need. To this end, we have engaged high-profile speakers with relevant expertise, for an event of speeches and panel questions.\r\n\r\nThis event is part of a conference on the ethics of Privacy and

This talk will draw on the theorising of ‘new animism’ in anthropology and religious studies which moves beyond the problematic attribution of spirit to matter and anthropomorphism in the work of Tylor and in other Victorian imaginations of religion, to consider animist ontologies as those which conceive of a world which is filled with persons, only some of whom are human. I argue that this relational approach enables new, re-enchanting insights into Neolithic art in the passage tombs of the Boyne Valley in Ireland, the study of which has tended towards an anthropocentric concept of ‘the social’ and neurotheological analysis of altered states of consciousness. Animist ontologies effectively disrupt the subject/object dichotomy of Western thought, challenge reductionist neurotheology, and offer an extended understanding of agency and personhood. I focus particularly on ‘hidden art’ to demonstrate how a variety of animist ontologies (from animist-totemist to totemist-animist) may have operated at the Neolithic/Bronze Age transition.\r\n\r\nDr Robert J.

And, returning to a question of great interest to Darwin, how has the evolution of flowers and their pollinators been linked across evolutionary time?\r\n\r\nSir Peter Crane is the former Director of the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew and is currently a Professor at the University of Chicago. His research interests involve the integration of studies of living and fossil plants, in order to understand large-scale patterns and processes of plant evolution. \r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 60, "image_id": null, "added": "2009-04-27T10:18:12", "slug": "13d01a8419b180a3", "speakers": [{"id": 285, "name": "Sir Peter Crane", "slug": "sir-peter-crane"}], "topics": [{"id": 1398, "name": "evolution", "path": "/academic/science/philosophy/engineering/biology/medicine/evolut"}, {"id": 1399, "name": "evolution", "path": "/academic/science/philosophy/engineering/biology/medicine/evolut"}, {"id": 214, "name": "evolution", "path": "/science/biology/evolution"}, {"id": 1589, "name": "evolution", "path": "/science/evolution"}], "supercategory": "academic", "venue": {"id": 44, "name": "The Royal Society", "slug": "the-royal-society", "city": "London", "postcode": "SW1Y 5AG"}, "organizer": {"id": 44, "name": "The Royal Society", "slug": "the-royal-society"}, "date": "2009-05-12", "dates": [{"id": 7022, "from_date": "2009-05-12", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "18:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": "This lecture is free - no ticket or advanced booking required.

As a result of this process, the exercise of authority is now carried out increasingly at trans-, inter-, and supra-national levels. This poses a fundamental question for political thought. Do the new circumstances in which states operate require a reassessment of our understanding of distributive justice? In this series of talks, Andrea Sangiovanni will argue for three interconnected claims. First, that facts about political and social institutions should affect not only the implementation of principles of justice but also, and more controversially, their content, scope, and grounds. Second, that equality as a demand of justice only applies among citizens and residents of a state. This is not because citizens and residents share a collective identity, or because they are subject to the same coercive power, but because they share in the mutual provision of the collective goods necessary for a flourishing life. Equality is therefore best understood as a demand of reciprocity. Third, this reciprocity-based conception of distributive justice can be extended to the inter-, trans-, and supra-national level. Despite the fact that equality is a demand of justice only among citizens and residents of a state, this does not imply that we have no obligations of distributive justice beyond the state. It only implies that these will be different in both form and content from those we have at the domestic level. The third claim is developed in the institutional context of the European Union.", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": null, "added": "2008-10-01T13:57:09", "slug": "fc0b5a1ae3db6a6d", "speakers": [{"id": 7498, "name": "Dr Andrea Sangiovanni", "slug": "dr-andrea-sangiovanni"}], "topics": [{"id": 1474, "name": "culture", "path": "/academic/society/culture/culture"}, {"id": 687, "name": "society", "path": "/arts/architecture/planning/society"}, {"id": 1024, "name": "society", "path": "/arts/literature/french/society"}, {"id": 123, "name": "mobility", "path": "/society/urbanisation/planning/mobility"}, {"id": 61, "name": "politics", "path": "/politics"}, {"id": 1169, "name": "democracy", "path": "/politics/democracy"}, {"id": 1009, "name": "ethics", "path": "/politics/ethics"}, {"id": 428, "name": "europe", "path": "/politics/europe"}, {"id": 1119, "name": "humanrights", "path": "/politics/humanrights"}, {"id": 1014, "name": "immigration", "path": "/politics/immigration"}], "supercategory": "academic", "venue": {"id": 1359, "name": "Room G108, 20 Kingsway, LSE", "slug": "room-g108-20-kingsway-lse", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC2A 2AE"}, "organizer": {"id": 1075, "name": "Forum for European Philosophy, LSE", "slug": "forum-for-european-philosophy-lse"}, "date": "2008-11-18", "dates": [{"id": 6237, "from_date": "2008-11-18", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "18:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": null, "additional_info": "This event is free and open to all, without registration\r\n\r\nIt will take place in Room G108, 20 Kingsway, LSE\r\n\r\nFor further information on the Forum for European Philosophy, visit our website ar www.philosophy-forum.org", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 1359, "name": "Room G108, 20 Kingsway, LSE", "slug": "room-g108-20-kingsway-lse", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC2A 2AE"}, "organizer": {"id": 1075, "name": "Forum for European Philosophy, LSE", "slug": "forum-for-european-philosophy-lse"}}]}, {"id": 5921, "title": "Driven to Abstraction", "synopsis": "The evolution of abstract art", "keywords": "modern art", "body": "The recent reversal of fortune of abstract art with the dramatic return of representation and figurative art.

As recently as 1910, average life expectancy in the UK was only 50 years. Today, men can expect to live to their mid-to-late seventies, and women into the early eighties.\r\n\r\nThis raises a number of issues, some would say problems, for society, medicine and individuals. Experts worry about the burden an ageing population places on pensions and the NHS. But, as American bioethicist Leon Kass argues, ‘the challenges of an aging society are finally not economic and institutional but ethical and existential’. Culturally, we seem confused in our attitudes to aging and indeed death. Modern medicine is defined by the struggle to keep the grim reaper at bay, and this constant striving to put off the inevitable – to ‘rage against the dying of the light’ – is in many ways laudable, expressing a celebration of life. But some fear we are sacrificing quality of life by keeping people alive, no matter how old or frail they become. Is today’s pursuit of immortality, and eternal youth, a desperate reaction to our loss of faith in the ‘eternal life’ promised by religion?\r\n\r\nIs increasing the human lifespan a straightforward moral imperative, or should we accept death as something that gives meaning to life? Does our desire to live ever longer express a selfish attitude that neglects our responsibilities to those who will care for us? What does it mean to be old in a society in which people appear increasingly desperate to hold on to their youth, and the elderly are seen as a drain on resources? Are we so focused on living longer that we forget to live?

This is the final lecture-seminar in Stephen Alexander’s series on fascism, paganism and politics.\r\n\r\nPhilosopher of the taboo Stephen Alexander does an annual lecture-seminar at Treadwell’s. This year’s series looks at the darkly romantic temptation to seek out ways to tear apart the material reality of modern life, to make manifest “unbound powers of being”.

Now Berendt has turned his attention to another colourful and historic city. Taking the fire that destroyed the Fenice theatre in 1996 as his starting point, John Berendt creates a unique and unforgettable portrait of Venice and its extraordinary inhabitants. Beneath the exquisite facade of the world's most beautiful historic city, scandal, corruption and venality are rampant, and John Berendt is a master at seeking them out. Ezra Pound and his mistress, Olga; poet Mario Stefani; the Rat Man of Treviso; these are among the intriguing and eccentric characters whom Berendt skewers with his elegant pen. With his background in journalism, Berendt is perfectly poised to gain access to private and unapproachable people, and persuade them to talk frankly to him. The result is mischievous, witty, compelling - and destined to be the non-fiction success d'estime of the year.

Iain and his team are attempting to redress the imbalance between promotion and inhibition of genetically determined programmed cell death, which is disrupted in cancer, by inducing ovarian cancer cells to commit suicide, either with the stimulus of viruses or chemotherapy. While Adi and her team have developed a fast, convenient and novel technique known as ’gene hunting’, which looks to ‘trap’ new genes involved in this process. They may use different approaches, but share a common goal, and here reveal details of their fascinating work and discuss the obstacles to be overcome in converting our increased understanding of cancer cell biology into novel therapies for cancer and other human diseases. \r\n\r\nAdi Kimchi holds the Helena Rubinstein Professorial Chair in Cancer Research at the Weizmann Institute in Israel and has headed the Department of Molecular Genetics there since January 2001.

Previous winners of the medal include: Hew Strachan, John Keegan, Marrack Goulding and Percy Craddock.\r\n\r\nThe Command of the Ocean describes with unprecedented authority and scholarship the rise of Britain’s naval greatness, and the central place of the Navy and naval activity in the life of the nation and government. Based on the author's own research in half a dozen languages over nearly a decade, and synthesising a vast quantity of secondary material, it describes not just battles and cruises, but how the Navy was manned, how it was supplied with timber, hemp and iron, how its men (and sometimes women) were fed, and above all how it was financed and directed.\r\n\r\nRead our review of The Command of the Ocean here.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nA second medal will be presented on this occasion to the Imperial War Museum for their series of histories published by Sidgwick.

She has been a refugee since she was 9 years as a result of the Moroccan invasion and occupation of her homeland in 1975. After studying Psychology at the Central University of Santa Clara in Cuba, she joined the diplomatic front of the Polisario, the Saharawi liberation movement. She has been Saharawi representative in Switzerland and Italy and member of the Referendum Commission that, under UN mandate, is trying to organise a referendum in the Western Sahara. She is also an active member of the National Union of Saharawi Women and has visited numerous countries in educational tours aimed at bringing international attention to the Western Sahara conflict.\r\n\r\n\r\nSaharawi Refugee Camps: dead and stagnation in no-man's land\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Western Sahara is the last African colony. It was occupied in 1975 by Morocco, despite the protests of the UN and the resistance of the independence Saharawi movement, the Polisario Front. The war lasted until 1991, when the UN brokered a peace agreement and deployed a peace force. But Morocco has blocked since then the main element of the peace plan: the self-determination referendum that will decide the future of the territory. The peace process seems now stagnated and hopes for a peaceful solution are evaporating quickly. Meanwhile, the Saharawi people continue divided by a military wall constructed by Morocco during the 1980's. Rabat controls the western part of the wall, three quarters of the Western Sahara approximately. The rest is administered by the Polisario, which also runs the refugee camps in neighbour Algeria where 175,000 Saharawis survive since the 70's. In this lecture, the Saharawi diplomat Fatima Mahfud will introduce the history of the conflict and its future perspectives, focussing on the construction of a Saharawi exiled state based in the refugee camps. A democratic state where there are no salaries, each refugee has a vote and women are equal to men. A state born out of hope in no man's land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnless otherwise noted, lectures start at 5.30, last one hour and take place in the Curtis Auditorium, Herschel Building, which sits directly across the road from Haymarket Metro Station.
