With a chequered history of Roman occupation, Chartist uprisings, and as a critically important sea port and railway town Newport has quickly developed to meet the expansion of economic and industrial heartlands of Wales. Newport is well described as a haven of modern Britain with its exotic mix of settlers of Welsh, Irish, English, Italian, Arab and Asian origins, and it is certainly one of the most lively multi-cultural and cosmopolitan cities of the country.\r\nThe town’s allegiance to the British monarchy has had its troubled past. As late as Queen Victoria’s Jubilee of 1897 the residents of Newport were only lurkwarm in their celebrations. However the succession of 20th century Princes of Wales have all found more love and interest created by their actions and high public profiles with more affection shown for them in Wales across religions, creeds and classes. The charismatic Edward, Prince of Wales was widely welcomed in Newport in 1921 when he rode on the town’s famous Transporter Bridge. In 1937 the new King George VI and Queen Elizabeth visited Newport to much praise and public cheering. After the Second World War several members of the Royal family passed through Newport and received a good Welsh welcome. It has not just been Royals who have given Newport the pleasure of a visit, many VIPS from all walks of life , politicians, Prime Ministers, stars of stage, screen and TV have also appeared in the town ( now a City).

The emphasis will be on audience participation and any lectures will be brief, and have plenty of time set aside for collective exploration of emerging themes and ideas.\r\n\r\nAs this is the Prometheus Trust's first regular meeting in Bristol we thought we might begin with an attempt at a broad brushstroke lecture on philosophy and the Platonic tradition. We'll look at some fundamental questions – What is philosophy? What is the wisdom which it cultivates? What part does it play in human life? How do we go about finding a stable foundation for philosophical enquiry? What powers does a human being need to exercise in the philosophical exploration of truth?\r\n\r\nAfter what will necessarily be a brief look at such questions, we'll go on to look at the Platonic tradition as the great tap-root of Western culture: what did Plato, his predecessors and his successors think they were doing as they philosophized? How did they address the differing levels of human experience? In what way did their approach to philosophy differ from what is now considered to be \"doing philosophy\"? What (self-imposed) demands were placed upon a would-be philosopher?\r\n\r\nFinally, and perhaps most importantly, we will attempt to look at the Platonic tradition not as a historical artefact, but as a living, breathing, growing tradition – one which, should any individual so choose, can be entered and which both gives and receives insights to and from today's men and women.\r\n\r\nWe will aim to keep the formal lecture to no more than 40 minutes so that we have a least an hour for an open forum discussion of these ideas. Although we hope to offer some firm foundations for future meetings, the evening will be very much a starting point and one which will raise far more questions than it answers. \r\n\r\nNo previous experience of formal philosophy is required.\r\n\r\nEntrance in free, but donations between £3-5 will be welcomed.\r\n\r\nA PDF download of the extract we will be reading is available on our website together with further details of this and other Prometheus Trust's activities: www.prometheustrust.co.uk (the PDF is on the \"London Monday Evenings\" page.)\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 2377, "added": "2018-09-12T19:32:04", "slug": "cf7dc4e0b2ec4fae", "speakers": [{"id": 3573, "name": "  Tim Addey", "slug": "tim-addey"}], "topics": [{"id": 3310, "name": "mythology", "path": "/religion/spirituality/spiritualdevelopment/mythology"}, {"id": 1821, "name": "religion", "path": "/academic/religion/religion/religion"}, {"id": 2129, "name": "religion", "path": "/arts/history/religion/religion"}, {"id": 1822, "name": "philosophy", "path": "/academic/religion/religion/philosophy"}], "supercategory": "religion", "venue": {"id": 3463, "name": "Hydra Books", "slug": "hydra-books", "city": "Bristol", "postcode": "BS2 0EZ"}, "organizer": {"id": 2041, "name": "The Prometheus Trust", "slug": "the-prometheus-trust"}, "date": "2018-10-03", "dates": [{"id": 16821, "from_date": "2018-10-03", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "19:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Donation", "ticket_info": null, "additional_info": null, "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 3463, "name": "Hydra Books", "slug": "hydra-books", "city": "Bristol", "postcode": "BS2 0EZ"}, "organizer": {"id": 2041, "name": "The Prometheus Trust", "slug": "the-prometheus-trust"}}]}, {"id": 16246, "title": "Richard Hageman: Song and Film Score Composer", "synopsis": "Nico de Villiers discusses the songs of composer Richard Hageman.", "keywords": "music, composition, richard hageman, film scores", "body": "Nico de Villiers (pianist, researcher and vocal coach, Guildhall School of Music & Drama) discusses the songs of composer Richard Hageman, and investigates the difference between 'picturesque' and ‘scenic' writing, and how it influenced Hageman’s songs and scoring for film.

Whilst the renown of certain species may be explained by dubious theories such as The Doctrine of Signatures, Professor Houghton reveals that modern science is supplying evidence to support the traditional use of certain plants. \r\nWhether your pass time is gardening, your profession medicine, your passion history or a combination of any of the above, a few hours in the splendid surroundings of the Royal College of Physicians’ medicinal garden in the company of our experts makes for the perfect summer afternoon. \r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 180, "image_id": 2508, "added": "2016-07-14T08:46:36", "slug": "9eb92164a2506d33", "speakers": [{"id": 16265, "name": "Professor Michael Black", "slug": "professor-michael-black"}, {"id": 11720, "name": "Professor  Peter Houghton", "slug": "professor-peter-houghton"}], "topics": [{"id": 1397, "name": "medicine", "path": "/academic/science/philosophy/engineering/biology/medicine"}, {"id": 2692, "name": "history", "path": "/arts/finearts/film/film/history"}, {"id": 106, "name": "wwi", "path": "/arts/books/history/military/wwi"}, {"id": 107, "name": "wwii", "path": "/arts/books/history/military/wwii"}], "supercategory": "academic", "venue": {"id": 2684, "name": "Royal College of Physicians", "slug": "royal-college-of-physicians", "city": "London", "postcode": "NW1 4LE"}, "organizer": {"id": 2684, "name": "Royal College of Physicians", "slug": "royal-college-of-physicians"}, "date": "2016-07-18", "dates": [{"id": 16037, "from_date": "2016-07-18", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "13:30:00", "ticket_cost": "£10", "ticket_info": "https://www.rcplondon.ac.uk/events/medicinal-plant-lecture-when-britain-ruled-waves", "additional_info": null, "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 2684, "name": "Royal College of Physicians", "slug": "royal-college-of-physicians", "city": "London", "postcode": "NW1 4LE"}, "organizer": {"id": 2684, "name": "Royal College of Physicians", "slug": "royal-college-of-physicians"}}]}, {"id": 14977, "title": "The youths on the wheel: the power of youth languages in Uganda", "synopsis": "Saudah Namyalo and Jenneke van der Wal discuss the ‘youth language’ of Makerere University students.

They are feelings, inside, sort of. They are what we feel when we are happy and sad and stuff. There’s nothing to them.\r\nWith a little more thought, it seems obvious they are something that evolved for some reason, to draw us towards pleasure (such as the right food) or away from pain (such as being eaten by a bear), but are they that simple, or do cultures shape emotions? It turns out there’s a bit of an academic war going on, and Richard believes that both sides are wrong because they are both right.\r\nOne side (mostly psychologists) are convinced that emotions come from biological evolution and are universal. Although we might dress up emotions differently – such as the stiff upper lip of the Englishman against the histrionics we might expect of a Mediterranean if you’ll pardon the stereotypes – the underlying emotions are the same. The other side (mostly anthropologists) is confident that society and culture constructs emotions and that evolution had little to do with it; many cultures have emotions that we don’t even have words for in English.\r\nThere is a third way.\r\nRichard Firth-Godbehere first became interested in emotions, and especially disgust, while his wife was suffering from a phobia for vomiting. Since then, he has been studying what emotions are and were, and trying to find a way through the academic minefield that is the study of emotions. In this talk, Richard will argue that emotions are biological and that we all have a number of neurochemicals and hormones that use the central nervous system to transmit a type of information that is just as essential as conscious thought, but how we interpret those messages depends on having the language to recognize them.\r\nBy taking us through time and examining the history of emotions, Richard will explain why the Emperor Marcus Aurelius in the film Gladiator made a poor choice, why Star Trek’s Data couldn’t choose an Ice Cream, and why sin alone once decided whether an emotion was positive or negative. He will also make you feel an emotion or two you didn’t even know existed, including one that doesn’t even exist. All this is to show how cultural language taps into universal bodily states allows us to know how we feel.\r\nRichard Firth-Godbehere is a Wellcome Trust supported Doctoral Scholar in the Medical Humanities at the Centre for the History of Emotions, Queen Mary, University of London. He is researching how Abomination, Horror, the Uncanny, Disgust and other 'Aversion' emotions were related to Medicine in the 17th and 18th Centuries.\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 1955, "added": "2013-08-25T10:20:19", "slug": "1ecd7b58e220dadd", "speakers": [{"id": 13926, "name": "Richard Firth-Godbehere ", "slug": "richard-firth-godbehere"}], "topics": [{"id": 928, "name": "neuroscience", "path": "/science/publicunderstandingofscience/neuroscience"}, {"id": 2517, "name": "neuroscience", "path": "/academic/medicine/neuroscience"}, {"id": 2788, "name": "neuroscience", "path": "/science/neuroscience/neuroscience"}, {"id": 372, "name": "psychology", "path": "/academic/philosophy/psychology"}], "supercategory": "science", "venue": {"id": 704, "name": "Conway Hall", "slug": "conway-hall", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC1R 4RL"}, "organizer": {"id": 704, "name": "Conway Hall", "slug": "conway-hall"}, "date": "2013-11-24", "dates": [{"id": 13258, "from_date": "2013-11-24", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "11:00:00", "ticket_cost": "£5", "ticket_info": "http://www.conwayhall.org.uk/richard-firth-godbehere", "additional_info": "Complimentary Tea and coffee will be available.\r\n", "members_only": "No", "members_info": "Members of Conway Hall Ethical Society gain free entry to all Sunday Lectures.\r\nhttp://www.conwayhall.org.uk/ethical-society", "venue": {"id": 704, "name": "Conway Hall", "slug": "conway-hall", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC1R 4RL"}, "organizer": {"id": 704, "name": "Conway Hall", "slug": "conway-hall"}}]}, {"id": 12751, "title": "Magic and Madness ", "synopsis": "How far was mysticism related to mental illness?

At its core it does not recognise time and place- concepts which are very fundamental to the human experience. Liberalism does not recognise the sacrifices of previous generations nor does it give room for the idea of collective sacrifice for a better future.\r\n\r\nSo why are today’s Humanists just liberals? Today’s SPES inhabits a building that was brought about by mutual sacrifice. Those original founders of this building pooled money together and left this building in trust to the future. Why go to so much effort? Because those founders and their congregation believed it was important to create a shared space to further and protect their joint aims. This action was not just about ideas of liberalism – freedom, choice and individualism. It was much more than this. It was also about creating a better, more ethical community, without God. In some part – perhaps the most important part – this project was about mutualism.\r\n\r\nSo why hasn’t this generation of inheritors left a similar legacy? In economic terms, you could argue that this generation has leeched off the sacrifices of another, adding very little for the young humanists of today to inherit. The answer is that a purely liberal construct allows for nothing more. Because this society cannot agree on aims larger than letting each member live his own conception and attacking organised religion, it has in effect emptied the grain store and watched the barn rot. It does not have to be like this. I believe this society will lead the way to a new mutualism- devoid of god, grounded in real experience and yet filled with hope and a sense of fulfilled obligations.", "keywords": "Humanism, Secularism, Atheism, Philosophy, Liberalism, Politics, Society", "body": "Shiv Malik started his career in investigative journalism working for the New Statesman.

Without this we are unable to make informed wildlife management decisions and, with human influence increasingly dominating habitats around the world, effective management is essential for the maintenance of wild species. We also have a natural fascination with animals, their behaviour and diversity. For many species very little is known about their behaviour and ecology in the wild. At this meeting findings will be presented from studies using camera traps — a rapidly expanding tool used in conservation and behavioural studies. Through this work, the private lives of some of the most rare and elusive animals located in the remotest parts of the world are observed. The ways in which camera traps can be used to inform present and future conservation action are also discussed.\r\n\r\n_Organised by Chris Carbone and Marcus Rowcliffe, Institute of Zoology, ZSL._\r\n\r\nThis event in the 'Communicating Science' series will begin at 6.00pm (doors from 5.00pm) and talks are scheduled to finish at 7.30pm; admission is free and open to everyone (no advance booking or registration required).

Mankind was starting to uncover the very building blocks of life and what makes us, but what about womankind? This was a time when women couldn’t receive degrees on completing their exams, and women’s colleges had to fund their own laboratories as male scientists wouldn’t let the complete practical work in their labs. And yet, the early work in this new field of genetics is filled with the names of women scientists. \r\n\r\nNow, a new play is bringing these names to life to explore their dedication and their contribution against a backdrop of exclusion from the mainstream scientific community.\r\n\r\n‘Blooming Snapdragons’, written and performed by Liz Rothschild and Syreeta Kumar, tells the story of a remarkable group of scientists, known collectively as Bateson’s Ladies, whose contribution to the first steps into the vast new territory of genetics is marked through their scientific achievements, whilst little is known of them as people. It explores their preclusion from the male dominated laboratories of universities and their relationship with William Bateson, who coined the word ‘genetics’ but was himself a marginalised figure in academic society.\r\n\r\nWilliam Bateson was the first director of the John Innes Institute, an organisation that is celebrating its centenary this year, and it through researching material for the centenary celebrations that much of the groundbreaking work of these remarkable ladies has come to light, and prompted the modern day John Innes Centre to commission a play to tell their stories.\r\n\r\n“It has been a fascinating journey into this period of scientific history so relevant to the work being done today and a rare privilege to be invited, as a writer with no scientific background, into the everyday world of laboratories and glasshouses,” commented Liz Rothschild. \r\n\r\n‘Blooming Snapdragons’ takes place in a contemporary laboratory as two scientists explore the lost story of these women. Playing a series of female scientists from the past, they examine the controversy around educating women and how their careers developed, whilst one of them wrestles with her own personal challenges today.", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": null, "added": "2010-04-20T09:32:12", "slug": "a3b84dc2e3df578d", "speakers": [{"id": 352, "name": "- - -", "slug": ""}], "topics": [{"id": 69, "name": "science", "path": "/science"}, {"id": 156, "name": "genetics", "path": "/science/genetics"}, {"id": 164, "name": "history", "path": "/science/history"}], "supercategory": "science", "venue": {"id": 2, "name": "The Royal Institution of Great Britain", "slug": "the-royal-institution-of-great-britain", "city": "London", "postcode": "W1S 4BS"}, "organizer": {"id": 2, "name": "The Royal Institution of Great Britain", "slug": "the-royal-institution-of-great-britain"}, "date": "2010-07-14", "dates": [{"id": 8584, "from_date": "2010-07-14", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "19:00:00", "ticket_cost": "Tickets cost £8 standard, £6 concession, £4 Ri Members", "ticket_info": "www.rigb.org or by calling the Events team on 020 7409 2992 9.00am-5.00pm Monday to Friday.", "additional_info": null, "members_only": "No", "members_info": "Available through the website, www.rigb.org.\r\n", "venue": {"id": 2, "name": "The Royal Institution of Great Britain", "slug": "the-royal-institution-of-great-britain", "city": "London", "postcode": "W1S 4BS"}, "organizer": {"id": 2, "name": "The Royal Institution of Great Britain", "slug": "the-royal-institution-of-great-britain"}}]}, {"id": 8194, "title": "Dennis Morris: Life through a Lens", "synopsis": "Hackney born photographer Dennis Morris reflects upon his remarkable career.", "keywords": "history,", "body": "Hackney born photographer Dennis Morris was just 11 years old when one of his photographs was printed on the front page of The Daily Mirror.
