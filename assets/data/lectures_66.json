The course will last ten weeks and will run every Tuesday from 8 November 2016 to 17 January 2017, with a break for holidays on 27 December. It will be hosted at the Library from 6:30 pm – 8:30 pm. The full price of the course is £175, just £17.50 per session.\r\n\r\nThe main aim of this course is to look at the phenomenon of genocide in the modern world. It has been argued that the Holocaust was a critical turning point, a catastrophe which required a fundamental rethinking of how the rights of human beings could be protected when states try to murder large numbers of people, including many of their own citizens, what we now call genocide. The course will begin with reflections on the Nazi attempt to annihilate the Jews and some of the immediate responses to the Holocaust, particularly the Genocide Convention which was passed by the newly formed United Nations in December 1948. The Convention was designed to commit the international community to halt and prevent the recurrence of this crime but there have nevertheless been several cases since 1948, across decades and continents.  We will look first at some of the key crucial issues that arise when we think about what is involved in genocide and why it is (as the Tribunal on the Rwanda genocide put it) “the crime of crimes”. We then examine a number of cases of genocide that have taken place since the Holocaust, and consider why almost nothing has been done to halt or prevent the crime, despite the promise of the Convention. Among the cases we will look at are the genocides in Cambodia, Guatemala, Iraq, Yugoslavia, Rwanda and Darfur. The course will conclude with some reflections on how justice might be provided in the aftermath of genocide.\r\n\r\nEach week, there will be some basic directed reading. There will also be a longer list of readings each week. All of this you can access in the Library. The first hour each week will be a lecture, which will then be followed by a seminar discussion of a key question. \r\n\r\nFor further information and to enrol, please contact nlavee@wienerlibrary.co.uk.\r\n\r\n\r\nProfessor Philip Spencer\r\n\r\nPhilip Spencer is Emeritus Professor in Holocaust and Genocide Studies at Kingston University and Visiting Professor in Politics at Birkbeck College, London University.

Two particular challenges were inherent in this: Firstly, how to develop a valid assessment model for an extra-curricular activity whose greatest asset was the opportunity it provided for pupils to rise to the challenge of doing something difficult, new and different for its own sake and as a release from the grind of constant assessment within the curriculum. Secondly, how to assess ‘soft’ transferable skills such as team-working and creative thinking in ways that would be valid, and could be scaled up, in an activity that required high staff-pupil ratios.

The plan would have made £3billion of funding available for transport improvements, much of it borrowed against future revenue from a proposed rush-hour congestion charge. The voters of Manchester, it appeared, were in no mood to foot the bill for improvements through a tax on driving. Changing transport systems is rarely a straightforward process, given that they are complicated, and engineers are typically locked into an infrastructure designed for a previous age – not to mention the additional pressure today of public spending cuts. Proponents of the Manchester transport plan claimed the city has the slowest-moving traffic in England. In built-up areas, there is clearly a limit to how many extra roads can be built. Many agree that public transport services need to become more frequent, less crowded and more reliable. And that means spending money. While nobody likes paying higher fares or more tax, that may be just the kind of uncomfortable choice that needs to be made.\r\n\r\nOn top of concerns about congestion and worries about safety, changing cultural attitudes mean that for many mobility itself is no longer an unquestioned good: cars are frowned upon, aviation deemed too carbon intensive, trains too expensive, and space travel simply pointless. We are urged to consider alternatives: whether it is restricting car use in favour of cycling or reducing unnecessary journeys through stay-at-home tele-conferencing. Local government supports car pooling schemes and energy-efficient transport. The idea of environmental taxes to fund new infrastructure and penalise transport use has widespread support.\r\n\r\nShould politicians be unashamed about arguing for the funding required to make travel easier if that is what the voters want? Or do they, and we all, have a responsibility to curb our enthusiasm for rapid transport: in the interests of both the environment and just slowing down the pace of life a little? The technology now exists to make what were once the dreams of science fiction a reality: jet-packs; hydrogen powered cars; Maglev public transport; and automated highways. Yet we have much more modest transport ambitions today, in which high-speed rail links come only slowly and at the expense of new runways.

By harnessing the energy of profit-making to the objective of fulfilling human needs, social business creates self-supporting, viable commercial enterprises that generate economic growth even as they produce goods and services that make the world a better place. In Building Social Business, Professor Yunus shows how social business has gone from being a theory to an inspiring practice, adopted by leading corporations, entrepreneurs and social activists across the world. He also demonstrates how social business transforms lives; offers practical guidance for those who want to create social businesses of their own; explains how public and corporate policies must adapt to make room for the social business model; and shows why social business holds the potential to redeem the failed promise of free-market enterprise.\r\n\r\nThis event celebrates the publication of Professor Yunus new book Building Social Business|. \r\n\r\nMuhammad Yunus was born in Chittagong, a seaport in Bangladesh. The third of fourteen children, he was educated at Dhaka University and was awarded a Fulbright scholarship to study economics at Vanderbilt University. He then served as chairman of the economics department at Chittagong University before devoting his life to providing financial and social services to the poorest of the poor. He is the founder and managing director of Grameen Bank and the author of the bestselling Banker to the Poor.

Humanity faces problems of such complexity and immense magnitude that there is a growing recognition that existing methods of group communication, will no longer provide the solutions we seek. \r\n\r\nIn response to this, innovative group facilitators have been experimenting and exploring a newly emerging phenomenon termed Collective Consciousness. From Juanita Brown’s World Cafes, to  Peter Senge’s and Otto Scharmer’s ‘Presencing’, from  M Scott Peck’s Community Building to Harrison Owens’s Open Space Technology, it is being realized by a growing number of people that the whole is indeed far more than the sum of the parts. That is when individuals come together with a shared intention, in a conducive environment; something mysterious can come into being, with capacities and intelligences that far transcend those of the individuals involved. \r\n\r\nRon and Victoria Friedman are the founders and creative impetus behind the Vistar method of communication, based in Connecticut, USA, which they describe as ‘an evolutionary meeting structure for accessing the unlimited potential of the creative source’. The Friedmans describe their overwhelming desire to share with the public ‘the timeless, powerful and practical Truth about human Identity and essential Self, as well as the individual growth and the outpouring of creativity that has been their shared experience’ in evolving the Vistar method and founding the Voicepoint theatrical company.\r\n\r\nChris Parish is recognized as a leading exponent of the radical transformative group practice of Enlightened Communication. Based on the Evolutionary Enlightenment philosophy of Andrew Cohen, Chris explains, that this form of communication offers the direct experience of a higher order of relationship between human beings—in which there is both a free expression of one's deepest authentic self while at the same time, a meeting in a profound communion with others. Dissolving all barriers of separation, this remarkable consciousness, he suggests, holds the potential for solving the enormous problems caused by human conflict and division.\r\n\r\nIn this dialogue these pioneering facilitators and advanced practitioners of this emerging consciousness will explore the wide ranging and profound implications of these remarkable group experiences which Ron Friedman describes as a ‘new organ of interrelatedness’. In examining the power and potential of Collective Consciousness, Chris Parish and Ron and Victoria Friedman will describe why they feel this emergence is one of the next evolutionary steps for humanity.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 120, "image_id": 890, "added": "2008-11-06T14:06:13", "slug": "167a8d293d3d3851", "speakers": [{"id": 3105, "name": "Mr  Chris Parish", "slug": "mr-chris-parish"}], "topics": [{"id": 1398, "name": "evolution", "path": "/academic/science/philosophy/engineering/biology/medicine/evolut"}, {"id": 1399, "name": "evolution", "path": "/academic/science/philosophy/engineering/biology/medicine/evolut"}, {"id": 170, "name": "newtopic", "path": "/science/chemistry/biochemistry/catalysis/newtopic"}, {"id": 910, "name": "science", "path": "/arts/film/documentary/science"}], "supercategory": "academic", "venue": {"id": 809, "name": "EnlightenNext", "slug": "enlightennext", "city": "Islington", "postcode": "N1 8QG"}, "organizer": {"id": 809, "name": "EnlightenNext", "slug": "enlightennext"}, "date": "2008-11-18", "dates": [{"id": 6404, "from_date": "2008-11-18", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "19:30:00", "ticket_cost": "£10", "ticket_info": "http://www.ticketweb.co.uk/user/?region=gb_london&query=detail&event=296187&interface=", "additional_info": "http://www.andrewcohen.org/london/events.asp", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 809, "name": "EnlightenNext", "slug": "enlightennext", "city": "Islington", "postcode": "N1 8QG"}, "organizer": {"id": 809, "name": "EnlightenNext", "slug": "enlightennext"}}]}, {"id": 5660, "title": "The Future of U.S. Regulation", "synopsis": "LSE public lecture\r\n", "keywords": "us\r\npolitics\r\nglobalisation\r\neconomy", "body": "As the U.S. financial regulatory structure faces change in the years ahead, how will this affect the nature and role of regulation in the global marketplace?

Successful entrepreneur, Matt Mason, argues that from youth culture, out on the edges of the mainstream, come the ideas that ultimately change the mainstream itself – whether it’s graffiti, piracy, hacking, open source culture or remixing.  In the course of doing so he unravels some of our most basic assumptions about business and society and pinpoints trends to look out for in our future. \r\n\r\nChair: Kevin Anderson, blogs editor, The Guardian\r\n\r\nBook your free place \"online\":http://www.theRSA.org/events or by emailing <a href=\"mailto:lectures@rsa.org.uk\">lectures@rsa.org.uk</a> or by phoning 020 7451 6868. \r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 60, "image_id": 109, "added": "2008-05-02T23:29:51", "slug": "970de877a551f716", "speakers": [{"id": 6869, "name": "Matt Mason", "slug": "matt-mason"}, {"id": 6870, "name": "Professor Kevin Anderson", "slug": "professor-kevin-anderson"}], "topics": [{"id": 1070, "name": "anatomy", "path": "/academic/medicine/anatomy"}, {"id": 129, "name": "british", "path": "/arts/literature/fiction/british"}, {"id": 130, "name": "21stcentury", "path": "/arts/literature/fiction/british/21stcentury"}, {"id": 131, "name": "authors", "path": "/arts/literature/fiction/british/21stcentury/authors"}], "supercategory": "academic", "venue": {"id": 158, "name": "RSA", "slug": "rsa", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC2N 6EZ"}, "organizer": {"id": 158, "name": "RSA", "slug": "rsa"}, "date": "2008-05-08", "dates": [{"id": 5701, "from_date": "2008-05-08", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "13:00:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": "Book your free place \"online\":http://www.theRSA.org/events or by emailing <a href=\"mailto:lectures@rsa.org.uk\">lectures@rsa.org.uk</a> or by phoning 020 7451 6868.", "additional_info": "h3.

This raises interesting problems for the use of digital media for research and documentation. Drawing upon issues around performance as research, the workshop aims to reconsider how we imagine performance, media (and process of electronic recording or ‘mediatizing’), considered as practices. \r\nPractice as research is variously defined and interpreted by academics and performers. Although the outcome of practice-based enquiry is performance, because it is ephemeral, it is usually recorded (whether as plain or interactive DVD, or on CD for music). By a process of reification, it is this which becomes the preserved record of the research (and, in the last analysis, the 'documentation' acceptable to funding bodies). This also forms the basis of dance/music performance analysis, much of which further objectifies performance through various accepted and supposedly rigorous methods (e.g. formalist structural analysis through use of notation). If, however, recording necessarily transforms performance then, by definition, academics or practitioners are studying not the original event, but an artifact of the process of representation. \r\nPractice as research however opens possibilities of quite different and potentially radical ways of imagining performance. Keynote papers will rethink issues of what is involved in mediating (or ‘mediatizing’), how we are to understand performance conceptually and in relation to dance and music performance research and documentation, and so appropriate analytical modes of research in performance.\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 300, "image_id": null, "added": "2005-04-18T10:24:40", "slug": "a6f5ae1dfc65595a", "speakers": [{"id": 2336, "name": "various keynote speakers", "slug": "various-keynote-speakers"}], "topics": [{"id": 1, "name": "academic", "path": "/academic"}, {"id": 6, "name": "arts", "path": "/arts"}], "supercategory": "academic", "venue": {"id": 507, "name": "AHRB Research Centre for Crosscultural Music and Dance Performan", "slug": "ahrb-research-centre-for-crosscultural-music-and-dance-performan", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC1H OXG"}, "organizer": {"id": 507, "name": "AHRB Research Centre for Crosscultural Music and Dance Performan", "slug": "ahrb-research-centre-for-crosscultural-music-and-dance-performan"}, "date": "2005-04-23", "dates": [{"id": 1903, "from_date": "2005-04-23", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "9:00:00", "ticket_cost": "free", "ticket_info": null, "additional_info": "Khalili Lecture Theatre", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 507, "name": "AHRB Research Centre for Crosscultural Music and Dance Performan", "slug": "ahrb-research-centre-for-crosscultural-music-and-dance-performan", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC1H OXG"}, "organizer": {"id": 507, "name": "AHRB Research Centre for Crosscultural Music and Dance Performan", "slug": "ahrb-research-centre-for-crosscultural-music-and-dance-performan"}}]}, {"id": 1806, "title": "Cradle to Cradle: A Roadmap for the Next Industrial Revolution", "synopsis": "Michael Braungart, Green Party founder, former Greenpeace chemist, businessman, and visionary, proposes a radical path to eco-effective industrial systems design.", "keywords": "sustainabilty, science, recycling,system design, design, ecology, industry", "body": "Michael Braungart, Green Party founder, former Greenpeace chemist, businessman, and visionary, proposes a radical path to eco-effective industrial systems design.
