With a chequered history of Roman occupation, Chartist uprisings, and as a critically important sea port and railway town Newport has quickly developed to meet the expansion of economic and industrial heartlands of Wales. Newport is well described as a haven of modern Britain with its exotic mix of settlers of Welsh, Irish, English, Italian, Arab and Asian origins, and it is certainly one of the most lively multi-cultural and cosmopolitan cities of the country.\r\nThe town’s allegiance to the British monarchy has had its troubled past. As late as Queen Victoria’s Jubilee of 1897 the residents of Newport were only lurkwarm in their celebrations. However the succession of 20th century Princes of Wales have all found more love and interest created by their actions and high public profiles with more affection shown for them in Wales across religions, creeds and classes. The charismatic Edward, Prince of Wales was widely welcomed in Newport in 1921 when he rode on the town’s famous Transporter Bridge. In 1937 the new King George VI and Queen Elizabeth visited Newport to much praise and public cheering. After the Second World War several members of the Royal family passed through Newport and received a good Welsh welcome. It has not just been Royals who have given Newport the pleasure of a visit, many VIPS from all walks of life , politicians, Prime Ministers, stars of stage, screen and TV have also appeared in the town ( now a City).

Since the Holocaust, a generally-held assumption has been that the Évian Conference represented a lost opportunity to save Germany’s Jews, and that the conference failed to rescue the Jews of Europe. In this study, Paul Bartrop argues that in fact it did not fail when measured against the original reasons for which it was called.

Having had a hugely successful academic career he entered the public consciousness with his book Straw Dogs, a worldwide best seller described as ‘That rarest of things, a contemporary work of philosophy, wholly accessible, and profoundly relevant to the rapidly evolving world' (Will Self). John shows us that it is possible to live well – and even to flourish – when we turn away from the modern world’s myths. He is coming to The School of Life to reveal how humans may only truly be free when we abandon our quest for knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe belief that knowledge is intrinsically liberating goes all the way back to the founder of western philosophy Socrates, and beyond that to ancient religions and mystery cults--especially Gnosticism. Today this belief is expressed in the idea that science can enable humankind to leave behind immemorial evils such as illness, poverty and even (according to some thinkers) mortality. A third version of this belief can be found in psychoanalysis, not in the form that was theorised by Freud but as the practice now exists in our culture, which promises that self-knowledge can enable us to overcome our inner conflicts.\r\n\r\nJohn Gray suggests that knowledge can't set us free in any of these three ways. Instead, freedom for humans, lies in what the poet Keats called negative capability: being at peace with the world’s mystery.\r\n\r\nJoining John will be the philosopher Alain de Botton, founder of the School of Life.\r\n\r\nABOUT THE SCHOOL OF LIFE\r\nThe School of Life is devoted to developing emotional intelligence through the help of culture.

I will discuss how I have worked with psychosis and what we can learn from \"psychotomimetic\" substances.

They came to maturity in mathematical logic, around the 30's, in pursuit of metamathematics, the mathematics of mathematics. The first modern programming languages arose in the 50's; they made it possible to write today's complex software systems, which perform the myriad tasks we all now rely on. \r\n\r\nThe study of artificial languages forms a fascinating mix of science and engineering. Professor Plotkin will look at this story, and the interplay between logic and computer science, explaining what it takes to understand an artificial language. As well as its syntax, its form, one must also give an account of its semantics, its meaning, itself tied intimately to its use.

Two years on much work is in hand to reform global financial regulation, but it is not clear that the crisis will produce change as radical as initially supposed. Adair Turner will argue, however, that the crisis should provoke us to think deeply about the conventional wisdom of the last several decades in which economic growth maximisation is the clear objective of economic policy, and market liberalisation, including in financial markets, the universally applicable means. Against this instrumental justification of markets and resulting inequality, Adair Turner will advance a case for economic freedom as an end in itself but one which needs to be balanced with other desirable ends. This implies the need for the discipline of economics to consider a wide range of behavioural, historical and philosophical issues, eschewing a narrow focus on mathematical precision. Lord Turner will contrast his conclusions with those Lionel Robbins reached in his famous 1932 \"Essay on the Nature and Significance of Economic Science\". \r\n\r\nAdair Turner is chairman of the Financial Services Authority, the Climate Change Committee and the Overseas Development Institute. He is also chair of the Working Party of the G20 Financial Stability Board reporting to the G20 Summit in November 2010 and a visiting professor at LSE. \r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 732, "added": "2010-09-13T10:00:39", "slug": "c3debc7dc088bafc", "speakers": [{"id": 10219, "name": "Chair: Lord Turner", "slug": "chair-lord-turner"}], "topics": [{"id": 1239, "name": "economics", "path": "/politics/economics/latinamerica/economics"}, {"id": 1740, "name": "markets", "path": "/politics/globalisation/markets"}, {"id": 415, "name": "economics", "path": "/society/politics/economics"}, {"id": 92, "name": "economics", "path": "/academic/economics"}], "supercategory": "politics", "venue": {"id": 2131, "name": "Old Theatre", "slug": "old-theatre", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC2A 2AE"}, "organizer": {"id": 1287, "name": "London School of Economics & Political Science", "slug": "london-school-of-economics-political-science"}, "date": "2010-10-13", "dates": [{"id": 9210, "from_date": "2010-10-13", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "18:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": "This event is free and open to all with no ticket required.

Described as a “visionary, engineer, adventurer, avant-garde theatre producer, systems ecologist and all-round unique individual” (R.U. Sirius), Allen has told his story in Me and the Biospheres: a Memoir by the Inventor of Biosphere 2, which will be a background to his talk. In it, John Allen unfurls “both a warning and a call to action” (Tim Smit) and navigates the reader through his engaging account of the largest laboratory for global ecology ever built. \r\nBiosphere 2 covered three acres of Arizona desert and included seven model biomes: An ocean with coral reef, and a marsh, rainforest, savannah, desert, farm, and micro-city. Eight people lived inside this structure for two years (1991-1993) and grew their own food, and recycled all air and waste. \r\n\r\nHis talk will introduce you to his extraordinary way of thinking and approach to biospheric states of consciousness, referring to some key people who have provided essential sources of inspiration to understanding our world of life, including: Richard Evans Schultes, Albert Hoffman, Yaqui Shaman, Amazonian Shaman, Anil Thakkar, Sergeant Jackson, and Hamid the Deaf and Dumb Magician. John will discuss how to distinguish different biospheric states of consciousness.\r\n\r\nJohn Allen is an accomplished total systems scientist, poet, philosopher, and inventor who started making Biosphere 2 by assembling together five “smaller” projects: The creation of a ferro-cement sailing ship (R/V Heraclitus) to study ocean and river ecologies and cultures; the development of a rainforest restoration project; a savannah regeneration station; a theatre group that performed on six continents; and the October Gallery, venue of this talk series, showing transvangarde art from around the world, and others. These projects, whose success led to Biosphere 2’s awe-inspiring construction and operation, demanded the efforts of a diverse team of international scientists, engineers, artists and thinkers with whom John Allen worked closely for decades. They included members of the National Science Academies of Russia, Great Britain, and USA.\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 1359, "added": "2010-04-07T11:05:16", "slug": "e79cb61ace983df6", "speakers": [{"id": 3373, "name": "John Allen", "slug": "john-allen"}], "topics": [{"id": 427, "name": "ecology", "path": "/arts/architecture/ecology"}, {"id": 1105, "name": "ecology", "path": "/science/ecology"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 449, "name": "The October Gallery", "slug": "the-october-gallery", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC1N 3AL"}, "organizer": {"id": 449, "name": "The October Gallery", "slug": "the-october-gallery"}, "date": "2010-04-27", "dates": [{"id": 8529, "from_date": "2010-04-27", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "18:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Entry £7 /£5 Concessions", "ticket_info": "Tel: 44 (0)20 7831 1618 \r\nemail: rentals@octobergallery.co.uk", "additional_info": "Arrive 6pm for a 6:30pm Start - Wine available", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 449, "name": "The October Gallery", "slug": "the-october-gallery", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC1N 3AL"}, "organizer": {"id": 449, "name": "The October Gallery", "slug": "the-october-gallery"}}]}, {"id": 8160, "title": "The Party: The Secret World of China's Communist Rulers ", "synopsis": "LSE public lecture ", "keywords": "China, politics, economy, industry, communism, government, revolution", "body": "China's political and economic growth in the past three decades is one of astonishing, epochal dimensions. The country has undergone a remarkable transformation on a scale similar to the industrial revolution in the West. The most remarkable part of this transformation, however, has been largely left untold—the central role of the Chinese Communist Party. As an organization alone, the Party is a phenomenon of unique scale and power. With more than seventy-three million members, it does more than just rule a country. The Party not only has a grip on every aspect of government, from the largest, richest cities to the smallest far-flung villages in Tibet and Xinjiang, it also presides over all official religions, the media, the military and large state-owned businesses. \r\n\r\nIn The Party, to be published by Allen Lane in June, Richard McGregor delves deeply into China's inner sanctum as few have done before. As the world's only geo-political rival of the United States, the Party's decisions have a global impact, yet it remains a deeply secretive body, hostile to the law, unaccountable to anybody or anything other than its own internal tribunals, and primed to think the worst of the West. \r\n\r\nRichard McGregor is the China bureau chief for the Financial Times. Since 1990, he has spent all but two years in north Asia, starting in Taiwan, and then in Tokyo, Hong Kong and Beijing, where he established offices for The Australian newspaper.

So, the Kelvin Lecture was founded in 1908 as a memorial to William Thomson, Lord Kelvin (1824–1907), former President (1874, 1889 and 1907, dying in the post) and Honorary Member of IEE. \r\n\r\nBorn in Belfast, Lord Kelvin was Professor of Natural Philosophy at the University of Glasgow 1846–99. He is particularly remembered for his work on heat and electricity, including introducing the Kelvin Temperature Scale, a temperature scale having an absolute zero below which temperatures do not exist. The importance of the discoveries and improvements that he made in connection with the transmission of messages by submarine cables led to his establishment as a leading authority in this field. He also discovered the Thomson effect in thermoelectricity: that if a temperature difference exists between any two points of a current-carrying conductor, heat is either evolved or absorbed depending upon the material. In addition, Kelvin invented the reflecting galvanometer and the siphon recorder, an instrument by which telegraphic messages are recorded in ink fed from a siphon.\r\n\r\nThe first Kelvin Lecture was given by past President Silvanus P Thompson (who also later had a lecture series established in his name) on 30 April 1908, on The Life and Work of Lord Kelvin.  Subsequent Kelvin Lectures have included some the most distinguished British scientists.  Electricity and Matter was discussed by Sir Ernest Rutherford in 1922; Electric Forces and Quanta by Professor J H Jeans in 1925; The Mechanics of the Electric Field by Sir J J Thomson in 1926 and The Architecture of the Solid State by Professor W L Bragg in 1931.  In 2009 Professor Sir John Pendry had the honour of giving the 100th Kelvin Lecture at Savoy Place and the Kelvin Gallery of the University of Glasgow on Creating the Invisibility Cloak: New Horizons in Electromagnetism.  \r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 1201, "added": "2009-08-10T02:08:06", "slug": "the-institute-of-engineering-and-technology-kelvin-lecture", "speakers": [{"id": 8492, "name": "Professor Shuji Nakamura", "slug": "professor-shuji-nakamura"}], "topics": [{"id": 69, "name": "science", "path": "/science"}], "supercategory": "science", "venue": {"id": 1337, "name": "The IET", "slug": "the-iet", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC2R 0BL"}, "organizer": {"id": 1337, "name": "The IET", "slug": "the-iet"}, "date": "2010-03-11", "dates": [{"id": 7174, "from_date": "2010-03-11", "to_date": "2010-03-11", "time": "18:00:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": "www.theiet.org/kelvin", "additional_info": null, "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 1337, "name": "The IET", "slug": "the-iet", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC2R 0BL"}, "organizer": {"id": 1337, "name": "The IET", "slug": "the-iet"}}]}, {"id": 6758, "title": "RINGS AROUND THE GRAVE", "synopsis": "JEWISH TREASURES OF THE BLACK DEATH", "keywords": "Jewish, Medieval, Black death, religion, religious, German, judaica", "body": "<img src='http://www.lecturelist.org/assets/images/1165.jpg' alt='' />\r\n\r\nThe Martin Norton Annual lecture\r\n\r\nAn illustrated talk by Jennifer Marin, Curatorial Consultant to the Jewish Museum, highlighting objects from the Jewish Museum collection and the recent Wallace Collection exhibition ’Treasures of the Black Death'.\r\nThe talk will explore religious items found in the Erfurt and Colmar hoards, setting them within the context of the fate of the Jewish communities in Medieval Germany.\r\n\r\nDrinks reception 7pm, lecture at 7:30pm\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": null, "added": "2009-05-21T07:37:22", "slug": "3d4300b5ee15d22d", "speakers": [{"id": 8396, "name": "Jennifer Marin", "slug": "jennifer-marin"}], "topics": [{"id": 253, "name": "medieval", "path": "/arts/historyofart/medieval"}, {"id": 257, "name": "medieval", "path": "/arts/history/medieval"}, {"id": 353, "name": "medieval", "path": "/academic/history/medieval"}, {"id": 1053, "name": "medieval", "path": "/society/localhistory/medieval"}, {"id": 1482, "name": "history", "path": "/religion/judaism/history"}, {"id": 935, "name": "discrimination", "path": "/religion/judaism/discrimination"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 1964, "name": "ORT Building", "slug": "ort-building", "city": "London", "postcode": "NW1 7NB"}, "organizer": {"id": 1963, "name": "Jewish Museum London", "slug": "jewish-museum-london"}, "date": "2009-06-04", "dates": [{"id": 7081, "from_date": "2009-06-04", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "19:00:00", "ticket_cost": "£8", "ticket_info": "Call the Jewish Museum on 020 8371 7373 or email admin@jewishmuseum.org.uk\r\nTo book online visit www.jewishmuseum.org.uk\r\n", "additional_info": "Free to Friends of the Jewish Museum", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 1964, "name": "ORT Building", "slug": "ort-building", "city": "London", "postcode": "NW1 7NB"}, "organizer": {"id": 1963, "name": "Jewish Museum London", "slug": "jewish-museum-london"}}]}, {"id": 6756, "title": "Imagining the Sacred", "synopsis": "Is there a role for the sacred in our culture of surface?", "keywords": "Religion, Philosophy, Sacred, Academic, Arts, Debate, culture, society", "body": "Fundamentalism may be on the rise worldwide but in many parts of the west belief in organised religion continues to ebb away.

Yet, although complex, it is not complicated and taken in small steps is total simplicity. Therefore my talk is about how I came to an understanding of the subject. Too often listeners are baffled by a straightforward explanation given by a speaker; but if my motives for knowing the subject, my original misconceptions and eventual decipherment are recounted in the order that I made them, then something may be communicated. More has been learned of metrology in the last 30 years than at any comparable period in history. What has come to light are such things as that there are hard and fast values for all ancient modules; all of the ancient systems form a singularity; all are related by an elaborate arrangement of unit fractions and the overall system was worldwide. There will be time to only touch upon the structure and the application of the system, but it is hoped that an interest in the subject will be stirred. \r\n\r\nJohn Neal  is the author of All Done With Mirrors an in-depth exploration of measure, proportion, ratio and number. His background is emphatically non-academic with his schooling and working life being concerned with agriculture. Yet even so agriculture repeatedly uses measurements, linear, area, weights and volumes, and the measures that John learned as a student were both practical and archaic. It was here that his interest in number was nurtured and he has been absorbed in the subject ever since. It is a tradition that simple people are the messengers of the higher powers, because they are too witless to invent it.

There have been 15 UN-led interventions since 1946, and there are at least 74 wars in progress today. From his perspective as a former Royal Marine officer in the 1960s to the High Representative in Bosnia from 2002-6, Lord Ashdown discusses the successes and failures of peace-keeping operations, questions what lessons have been learned - and what lessons keep being forgotten. The men and women of the British armed forces are currently engaged in Afghanistan, Iraq and the Balkans in 'peacekeeping operations'. How do we avoid these missions turning into long-term entanglements, like the current disaster that is Iraq? How do we bring our soldiers home? And what do we do about 'failed states' that are havens for gangsters and terrorists? Paddy Ashdown fears we will soon see major wars between nation states. Many will begin as minor conflicts that will expand into full-scale wars unless the international community intervenes.\r\n\r\nPaddy Ashdown was leader of the Liberal Democrats between 1988 - 1999, before becoming High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina between 2002 – 2006.

How much of our craving to consume is a result of the psychological need for status? What part of our brain is driving this desire?  What are the global implications for a consuming society?\r\n\r\nBased on Abraham Maslow’s famous ‘Hierarchy of Needs’, Marlow builds upon the theory of humankind’s basic essential needs, such as food and water, to explore the psychological want for material objects.  Consumption in the Western world, although partly functional, is more and more centred around status.  Are consumers buying to make themselves happy, and if so, how long does that high last?  What can material goods really say about us?\r\n\r\nMarlow will also talk about the wider impact the material world can have on the natural one – looking at global warming, sustainability and dwindling natural resources.  In chasing our consumer dreams are we creating a hell on earth? \r\n\r\nNigel Marlow originally took a management degree at Leeds and had 15 years in the ‘rag-trade’. \r\nHe became interested in Psychology about 12 years ago and switched careers. He currently lectures and does research at London Metroplitan University.
