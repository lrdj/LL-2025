The Prince’s family scoffed at Rosemary’s chequered family pedigree and dismissed the love-weary Prince’s designs, leaving Rosemary, a heroic Red Cross nurse during the Great War, to be swept into marriage by Eric, Viscount Ednam, a close friend of Edward, and heir to an ancient English Earldom. The Ednams became a dynamic couple of the Bright Young Things era of the 1920s, but in July, 1930 at the peak of their chaotic life together, Rosemary met her sudden death in a horrific aeroplane crash, which also killed three of her fellow aristocrats. The unexplained accident (which remains unsolved even today) caused giant ripples across the whole of British Society. Rumours were rife of sabotage, especially as it was said that Edward, Prince of Wales, had only just escaped death in the same crash by changing his travel plans at the last minute. Will Cross (author of several biographies on the British gentry) unravels Rosemary’s life and times and offers some startling and sinister facts about the aftermath of her tragic death. An illustrated talk. Will Cross is working on a book about Rosemary and her brother Alistair ( who also died mysteriously). Both Rosemary and Alastair Leveson-Gower were friends of Gwyneth Morgan, the wayward daughter of Courtenay, Lord Tredegar.

The Themersons were part of the wave of émigrés and refugees who fled from Hitler’s Europe to Britain, and so enriched culture here in the post-war period.\r\n\r\nFranciszka and Stefan Themerson were originally from Warsaw and married in 1931. They spent much of the 1930s making experimental films in Poland. In 1938, Franciszka and Stefan moved to Paris in order to pursue their work at the centre of the art world. Following the German invasion of France in 1940, Franciszka escaped to London to work for the Polish Government in Exile, whilst Stefan was left stranded in France, having joined the Polish Army in France. During this period, Franciszka produced a remarkable series of drawings reflecting on her experiences and their separation, the Unposted Letters, which feature in the Wiener Library’s One Family, Three Cities, Six Years of War exhibition. The couple were reunited in 1942 in London, where they started to rebuild their lives, together and independently. In 1948, they founded Gaberbocchus Press, the first avant-garde press in Britain. They published the first English translations of Alfred Jarry, Kurt Schwitters and Raymond Queneau, alongside producing artworks and their own publications.\r\n\r\nProfessor Stephen Bann is Emeritus Professor of History of Art at the University of Bristol, where he was previously the Chair in History of Art. Since 2000, he has held visiting fellowships and appointments at some of the most prominent Research Institutes in Europe and America. He edited the first international anthology of concrete poetry to be published in Britain in 1967, and a major anthology of twentieth-century avant-garde writings, The Tradition of Constructivism, in 1974. He also curated the showing of his own collection of works by Ian Hamilton Finlay at Kettle's Yard, Cambridge, in 2014/15, and has recently published two volumes of his correspondence with Finlay (1964-69 and 1970-72).\r\n\r\nProfessor Bann first met Stefan and Franciszka Themerson in the early 1960s, when he was an undergraduate at Cambridge helping to run the Society of Arts. Stefan Themerson came to Cambridge at the Society’s invitation to give a lecture on Kurt Schwitters. Stephen Bann subsequently also reviewed a small clutch of Gaberbocchus publications for the magazine Granta. Contact between Bann and the Themersons continued over the succeeding decades, and Stephen curated the first American exhibition of Franciszka’s works in New York in 1977/78.\r\n\r\nSupported by GV Art London.\r\n\r\nPlease note that the talk by Professor Stephen Bann will commence at 6:30pm.

Chimurenga is a contributor to a new CounterPunch Books anthology, Killing Trayvons: An Anthology of American Violence, examining American brutality against people of colour through the lens of the 2012 shooting of the unarmed Trayvon Martin in Sanford, Florida by neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman, who was ultimately acquitted of second-degree murder and manslaughter charges.\r\n\r\nThe book explores why Trayvon’s name and George Zimmerman’s not guilty verdict symbolized all the grieving, the injustice, the profiling and free passes based on white privilege and police power: the long list of Trayvons known and unknown. The editors therefore titled this book Killing Trayvons because although Martin's profiling and death received extraordinary attention, they were crushingly ordinary, not only for black and brown youth in the suburbs and city streets of America but in the browner nations of the world, where the US, its clients and proxies stand their ground, claim self-defence, take preventive or pre-emptive action -- the verbal sleights-of-hand are many -- to deadly effect. \r\n\r\nWith contributions from Robin D.G.

Along the various routes that make up the network of the ‘Silk Road’ - itself a misnomer - flourished an exotic mixture of cultures from Arabic, Turkic, Iranian, Indian, Mongolian, Chinese and Tibetan sources.\r\n\r\nThe richness of cultures is evident in spectacular sites ranging from abandoned cities and fortresses, Buddhist cave sites and Islamic mausoleums along the many trade routes that made the Silk Road network. The Taklamakan and Gobi desert regions yielded many artistic treasures to 19th and 20th century European archaeologists who explored - and plundered - many sites for their uniquely preserved artefacts. The research that came from these items revealed much more understanding about the relevance and significance of the Silk Road and its place in the economic history of the region.\r\n\r\nThe legacy of the Silk Road lives on through the artefacts, writings, maps and contribution of the many travellers throughout the region over many centuries. However, this legacy may soon be found only in museums and collections, as the rapidly changing landscape of modern technology changes the face of this region.\r\n\r\nThe course aims to understand how and why the Silk Road trade network came into being and to explore reasons for the success and demise of its cities and traders in certain areas and eras. It will look at the diverse cultures that practiced different religions and produced exotic items that were traded freely along the routes, and what became of them in later years.

He is one of just three protesters to have been killed by the police in Britain since 1945. He died from a single blow to his head by a police officer, as Peach was retreating from a protest which had finished.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, following Ian Tomlinson’s death, the government published the Cass report into Peach’s killing. Cass identified the six police officers who were present when the fatal blow was struck, and recommended that three of them should be prosecuted for obstructing his enquiry. The Cass report was never disclosed to the Inquest into Peach’s death, and its central reports were kept hidden for 30 years from the jury, from the press, and from Blair Peach’s family. \r\n\r\nDavid Renton will be discussing his new pamphlet ‘Who Killed Blair Peach’ (published by Defend the Right to Protest, 2014) which sets out why exactly Cass reached his conclusions, how his reasoning casts a light on the identity of Peach’s killer, and calls for a fresh inquest into Blair Peach’s killing.\r\nDavid will be joined by founder of ‘Black History Walks’ Tony Warner who will consider contemporary cases of police racism and brutality. Using archive footage, newspaper reports and personal testimony Tony will cover cases of black deaths in custody from 1960s to the present day, with relation to geography, community resistance, international history and white media representation of the 'black body'.\r\nAbout the speakers\r\nDavid Renton a barrister and a member of the committees of Defend the Right to Protest and the Haldane Society of Socialist Lawyers.\r\nTony Warner is a historian and founder of ‘Black History Walks’.\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": null, "added": "2014-10-05T17:43:58", "slug": "025e71d51f165628", "speakers": [{"id": 15137, "name": "David  Renton ", "slug": "david-renton"}, {"id": 14484, "name": "Mr Tony  Warner", "slug": "mr-tony-warner"}], "topics": [{"id": 823, "name": "police", "path": "/academic/law/police"}, {"id": 1012, "name": "racism", "path": "/politics/waronterror/racism"}, {"id": 3450, "name": "racism", "path": "/society/racism/racism"}, {"id": 1623, "name": "police", "path": "/society/police"}], "supercategory": "academic", "venue": {"id": 2783, "name": "Housmans Bookshop", "slug": "housmans-bookshop", "city": "London", "postcode": "N1 9DX"}, "organizer": {"id": 2783, "name": "Housmans Bookshop", "slug": "housmans-bookshop"}, "date": "2014-10-14", "dates": [{"id": 14632, "from_date": "2014-10-14", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "19:00:00", "ticket_cost": "Entry £3, redeemable against any purchase", "ticket_info": null, "additional_info": "HOW TO FIND US:\r\nWe're very easy to find - just a two minute walk from King's Cross/St.Pancras terminals.

Since then, these and other developing countries have turned themselves around, while First World nations, battered by crises, depend more than ever on sustained growth in emerging markets. \r\n\r\nIn 'Turnaround', economist Peter Blair Henry argues that the secret to emerging countries’ success (and ours) is discipline—sustained commitment to a pragmatic growth strategy. With the global economy teetering on the brink, the stakes are higher than ever. And because stakes are so high for all nations, we need less polarization and more focus on facts to answer the fundamental question: which policy reforms, implemented under what circumstances, actually increase economic efficiency? \r\n\r\nPushing past the tired debates, Henry shows that the stock market’s forecasts of policy impact provide an important complement to traditional measures. \r\n\r\nThrough examples ranging from the drastic income disparity between Barbados and his native Jamaica to the “catch up” economics of China and the taming of inflation in Latin America, Henry shows that in much of the emerging world the policy pendulum now swings toward prudence and self-­&#8208;control. With similar discipline and a dash of humility, he concludes, the First World may yet recover and create long-­&#8208;term prosperity for all its citizens.\r\n\r\nPeter Blair Henry is the dean of New York University’s Stern School of Business and former professor of International Economics at Stanford University.

A member of the board of the National Bureau of Economic Research, the Council on Foreign Relations, and the Kraft Foods Group, Peter received his PhD in economics from MIT and Bachelor’s degrees from Oxford University, where he was a Rhodes Scholar, and the University of North Carolina, where he was a Morehead Scholar and a finalist in the 1991 campus-­&#8208;wide slam dunk competition.

Based on archival research and interviews with leading participants in the movement, Daniel Stedman Jones has traced the ascendancy of neoliberalism from the academy of interwar Europe to supremacy under Reagan and Thatcher and in the decades since. He contends that there was nothing inevitable about the victory of free-market politics. Far from being the story of the simple triumph of right-wing ideas, the neoliberal breakthrough was contingent on the economic crises of the 1970s and the acceptance of the need for new policies by the political left. In his lecture he will describe neoliberalism's road to power, beginning in interwar Europe, then shifting its centre of gravity after 1945 to the United States, especially to Chicago and Virginia, where it was developed into an uncompromising political message, communicated through a transatlantic network of think tanks, businessmen, politicians, and journalists held together by Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman. A discussion for anyone who wants to understand the history behind the Anglo-American love affair with the free market, as well as the origins of the current economic crisis. \r\n\r\nDaniel Stedman Jones is a barrister in London. He was educated at the University of Oxford and at the University of Pennsylvania, where he earned a PhD in history. He has worked as a policy adviser for the New Opportunities Fund and as a researcher for Demos. His latest book is Masters of the Universe: Hayek, Friedman, and the Birth of Neoliberal Politics|. \r\n\r\nMark Pennington is Professor of Public Policy and Political Economy, King's College, University of London, prior to which he spent eleven years at Queen Mary, University of London.

His latest book, Robust Political Economy (2011: Cheltenham, Edward Elgar) examines challenges to classical liberalism derived from neo-classical economics, communitarian political theory and egalitarian ethics. From January 2013 Mark will be the European Editor of the Review of Austrian Economics. \r\n\r\nRobert Skidelsky is Emeritus Professor of Political Economy at the University of Warwick.

A large European revolution. And a European federal Union must emerge. A Union that enables Europe to participate in the postnational world of tomorrow. By laziness, cowardice and lack of vision, too many of our Heads of State and Government prefer not to see what is at stake. Let’s wake them up. Let’s confront them with their impotence.

After obtaining his abitur at the Odenwaldschule, Germany, he decided to study Sociology at the University of Nanterre, Paris. He became the student leader and spokesperson in the social unrests in May 1968. Because of this role and his German nationality, Daniel Cohn-Bendit was expelled. He worked as a childcare worker and bookseller in the alternative-anarchist scene of Frankfurt am Main, where he co-founded the magazine Pflasterstrand (beach of cobblestone, from the French 1968 slogan \"Sous les pavés, le sable\"). In 1984, he was founding member of the German green party \"DIE GRÜNEN\". In 1989, he became honorary Head of Department in the Office for Multicultural Affairs in Frankfurt. Daniel Cohn-Bendit presented the Swiss TV programme Literaturklub from 1994 to 2003. \r\n\r\nHe was elected Member of the European Parliament for the first time in 1994 on a German conscription list. Since 2002, he is co-chairman of the group of the Greens/European Free Alliance. He won his current mandate as head of the list in Ile-de-France / Paris. Daniel holds an honorary doctorate from the Catholic University of Tilburg, Netherlands. He won the Hannah Arendt price for Political Thinking, and the Trombinoscope award \"Political Personality\" for special contributions in the field of politics (2009). \r\n\r\nGuy Verhofstadt  was born in 1953, and attended school and university in Ghent, where he studied the law. In 1972, he became President of the Liberal Flemish Students' Union in Ghent and, four years later, was elected as a City Councillor there.  Keen to follow his interest in national politics, Guy went on to take a number of high profile posts including Political Secretary to Willy De Clercq, National President of the Party for Freedom and Progress (PVV), an MP in the House of Representatives, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for the Budget, a Senator, and National President of the PVV and National President of the Flemish Liberals and Democrats (VLD). \r\n\r\nIn July 1999 he became Prime Minister of Belgium, heading three separate governments over the course of nearly ten years. In June 2009 Guy Verhofstadt was elected to the European Parliament where he will pursue his interests in European politics after winning the unanimous support of the ALDE Group in their leadership contest. In addition to his duties as a politician, Guy has written a number of books including, The United States of Europe (2006), The New Age of Empires (2008) and Emerging from the Crisis: How Europe can Save the World (2009). \r\n\r\nSuggested hashtag for this event for Twitter users: #LSEEurope ", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 732, "added": "2012-09-14T17:25:42", "slug": "4eaaa749c481e0fd", "speakers": [{"id": 12814, "name": "Daniel Cohn-Bendit", "slug": "daniel-cohn-bendit"}, {"id": 12815, "name": "Guy Verhofstadt ", "slug": "guy-verhofstadt"}], "topics": [{"id": 3118, "name": "nationstate", "path": "/politics/democracy/europe/nationstate"}, {"id": 3116, "name": "federalism", "path": "/politics/europe/federalism"}, {"id": 3117, "name": "europe", "path": "/politics/democracy/europe"}], "supercategory": "politics", "venue": {"id": 1515, "name": "Old Theatre, Old Building", "slug": "old-theatre-old-building", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC2A 2AE"}, "organizer": {"id": 1287, "name": "London School of Economics & Political Science", "slug": "london-school-of-economics-political-science"}, "date": "2012-10-08", "dates": [{"id": 11917, "from_date": "2012-10-08", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "18:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": "This event is free and open to all with no ticket required.

The exhibition, Johan Zoffany RA. Society Observed, is curated by Martin Postle (Paul Mellon Centre) with Gillian Forrester (Yale Center for British Art), and MaryAnne Stevens (Royal Academy), is being held at  the Royal Academy of Arts from 10 March to 10 June 2012.\r\n\r\nBorn in Frankfurt in 1733, Johan Zoffany trained as an artist in Germany and Italy. In 1760 he moved to London, where he adapted brilliantly to the indigenous art culture and patterns of patronage, creating virtuoso portraits and subject pictures that proved to be highly desirable to a wide range of patrons. Of all the major artists working in eighteenth-century England, none explored more inventively the complexities of Georgian society and British imperial rule than Zoffany. Yet, despite achieving considerable success there, he remained in many ways an outsider, looking dispassionately at British society. Resisting complete integration into his adopted country, Zoffany travelled for extended periods in Europe and spent six years in northern India. His body of work offers unique perspectives on key British and European institutions, including the art academy, the royal court, the theatre, and the families of the aristocracy and bourgeoisie. In India, Zoffany constructed new idioms for portraying the emerging colonial society in both public and private spheres, as well providing a nuanced account of the complex network of power relations, race, and culture at a critical moment in British imperial history.\r\n\r\nThe conference aims to address Zoffany's art in the context of four locations that were central to his practice: Germany, England, Italy, and India. \r\n\r\nThe full programme can be found at http://www.paul-mellon-centre.ac.uk/10/\r\n\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 480, "image_id": null, "added": "2012-03-01T16:29:27", "slug": "0865ac25a3200c26", "speakers": [{"id": 5222, "name": "Dr Martin Postle", "slug": "dr-martin-postle"}, {"id": 12094, "name": "Craig Hanson", "slug": "craig-hanson"}, {"id": 12095, "name": "Helen McCormack", "slug": "helen-mccormack"}, {"id": 12096, "name": "Steffen Egle", "slug": "steffen-egle"}, {"id": 12097, "name": "Kate Roach", "slug": "kate-roach"}, {"id": 12098, "name": "Anna Maria  Massari ", "slug": "anna-maria-massari"}, {"id": 12099, "name": "Kenneth  Bendiner", "slug": "kenneth-bendiner"}, {"id": 12100, "name": "Richard  Leppert ", "slug": "richard-leppert"}, {"id": 12101, "name": "William  Pressly ", "slug": "william-pressly"}], "topics": [{"id": 2692, "name": "history", "path": "/arts/finearts/film/film/history"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 716, "name": "Geological Society", "slug": "geological-society", "city": "London", "postcode": "W1J 0BG"}, "organizer": {"id": 710, "name": "Royal Academy of Arts", "slug": "royal-academy-of-arts"}, "date": "2012-05-14", "dates": [{"id": 11297, "from_date": "2012-05-14", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "9:00:00", "ticket_cost": "£40/£20 reductions", "ticket_info": "To register for the conference, check availability with Ella Fleming at the The Paul Mellon Centre.

Drawn entirely from firsthand materials in the F.B.I.'s own files, Enemies brilliantly brings to life the entire story, from the cracking of anarchist cells to the prosecution of the 'war on terror'. It is the story of America's war against spies, subversives and saboteurs - and the self-inflicted wounds American democracy suffered in battle. Throughout the book lies the long shadow of J. Edgar Hoover, who ran the F.B.I. with an iron fist for forty-eight years. He was not a monster, but a brilliant confidence man who ruled by fear, force, and fraud.

Some readers are shocked by Kierkegaard’s apparent approval of Abraham’s readiness to sacrifice his son at God’s command, especially as this suggests alarming parallels with the actions of religious terrorists. However, careful reading of Fear and Trembling shows that this response is too hasty.\r\n\r\nThis lecture will examine the important – but often overlooked – role of courage in Kierkegaard’s account of Abraham’s faith. Courage is one of the traditional ethical virtues, but for Kierkegaard a certain kind of courage has a special place in the Christian life. However, this virtue is not confined to a religious context. Fear and Trembling emphasises features of human existence that call for courage: finitude, vulnerability, uncertainty, and deep attachments to other mortal beings. For Kierkegaard, it takes courage to love another person, and this makes it a universal human virtue. In fact, living without God may require even more courage than living with belief in God. Furthermore, in our present age the fast pace of change and the dissolution of traditional shared values make courage more important than ever for those who want to hold on to the idea of an ethical life.\r\n\r\nClare Carlisle's (KCL) research interests converge at the interface between Philosophy and Theology: she is currently working on the philosophy of habit; Spinoza's ontology; and Kierkegaard's phenomenology of religious life.

In Celtic Iron Age religion, every river had a tutelary goddess, so this talk opens up a new dimension of London - her spirits of place. Tom Bolton explores five lost rivers, combining their history (and demise) with fascinating anecdotes. He brings alive the people and events surrounding each location and the story of each river's origins and decline. This one is for everyone who loves the hidden side of the magical place that is London.\r\n\r\nUnder our feet, away from the omnipresent Thames, a secret network of underground rivers snakes beneath the capital.  The rivers predate the city and its people. The rivers may be buried, but they still flow underground.  In some places they can be heard, or even seen.

Lynd Professor of Sociology, Columbia University. \r\n\r\nFollowing the tightening of immigration regulations and hardening of anti-immigrant feeling, it is imperative to discuss the role of migrants in Britain today, making connections with situations across the world, where refugee camps have become a permanent home for some, while others are condemned to be constantly on the move.\r\n\r\nConversation between Sassen; Pat Storey, Folkestone Migrant Support Group; Colin Prescod, Chair, Institute of Race Relations; and Triennial artist Nikolaj Bendix Skyum Larsen.\r\n\r\n3:45pm\tSESSION 2: NEW GEOGRAPHIES\r\n\r\nIn an expanded cultural sphere, what is the pressure for artists to represent national identities, while remaining intelligible to a global audience? How can artists react to the huge political changes and humanitarian trauma taking place in the Middle East and North Africa? Can we talk of a cultural apartheid, where many do not have access to an international network or are censored in their attempts to communicate across borders?\r\n\r\nPanel:TJ Demos, author of the forthcoming book Migrations: Contemporary Art and the Politics of Globalization; Nina Möntmann, Professor of Art Theory and the History of Ideas at The Royal Institute of Art, Stockholm; and Triennial artists Smadar Dreyfus and CAMP. Chair: Anthony Downey, Programme Director, MA in Contemporary Art at Sotheby’s Institute of Art, London.\r\n\r\n5:15pm\tSESSION 3: ART & RESISTANCE\r\nboundaries between art and activism are becoming blurred, and artists make frequent references to political and economic theories. But how effective is art as a form of resistance or in offering an alternative model for the future?\r\n\r\nPanel:Amanda Beech, co-director of the Political Currency of Art Research Group; JJ Charlesworth, associate editor, ArtReview; and Triennial artists Hala Elkoussy and Zineb Sedira. Chair: Richard Noble, political philosopher and editor, Utopias.\r\n\r\n\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 240, "image_id": 1544, "added": "2011-06-20T21:11:49", "slug": "common-skies-divided-horizons", "speakers": [{"id": 7328, "name": "Professor Saskia Sassen", "slug": "professor-saskia-sassen"}, {"id": 4767, "name": "Dr.  TJ Demos", "slug": "dr-tj-demos"}, {"id": 11222, "name": "Nina Möntmann", "slug": "nina-möntmann"}, {"id": 2473, "name": "Dr  Anthony Downey", "slug": "dr-anthony-downey"}, {"id": 11223, "name": "Dr.  Amanda Beech", "slug": "dr-amanda-beech"}, {"id": 2529, "name": "Mr JJ Charlesworth", "slug": "mr-jj-charlesworth"}, {"id": 10025, "name": "Dr.  Richard Noble", "slug": "dr-richard-noble"}, {"id": 4134, "name": "Colin Prescod", "slug": "colin-prescod"}, {"id": 11224, "name": "Pat  Storey", "slug": "pat-storey"}, {"id": 11225, "name": "Dr.  Andrea Schlieker", "slug": "dr-andrea-schlieker"}, {"id": 11226, "name": "Nikolaj Bendix Skyum Larsen", "slug": "nikolaj-bendix-skyum-larsen"}, {"id": 4683, "name": "Zineb Sedira", "slug": "zineb-sedira"}, {"id": 11227, "name": "Hala  Elkhoussy", "slug": "hala-elkhoussy"}, {"id": 11228, "name": "Smadar Dreyfus", "slug": "smadar-dreyfus"}, {"id": 11229, "name": "CAMP", "slug": "camp"}], "topics": [{"id": 527, "name": "politics", "path": "/politics/local/politics"}, {"id": 538, "name": "politics", "path": "/arts/photography/politics"}, {"id": 713, "name": "politics", "path": "/society/war/politics"}, {"id": 938, "name": "politics", "path": "/politics/philosophy/politics"}, {"id": 2385, "name": "conflict", "path": "/arts/journalism/conflict"}, {"id": 1073, "name": "contemporary", "path": "/arts/curating/contemporary"}, {"id": 1169, "name": "democracy", "path": "/politics/democracy"}, {"id": 315, "name": "visualculture", "path": "/arts/art/visualculture"}, {"id": 804, "name": "contemporaryart", "path": "/arts/art/contemporaryart"}, {"id": 390, "name": "media", "path": "/arts/media"}, {"id": 1009, "name": "ethics", "path": "/politics/ethics"}, {"id": 526, "name": "multiculturalism", "path": "/politics/multiculturalism"}, {"id": 428, "name": "europe", "path": "/politics/europe"}, {"id": 750, "name": "internationaldevelopment", "path": "/politics/internationaldevelopment"}, {"id": 820, "name": "international", "path": "/politics/international"}, {"id": 1553, "name": "artiststalk", "path": "/arts/artists/artiststalk"}], "supercategory": "politics", "venue": {"id": 2498, "name": "Folkestone Triennial", "slug": "folkestone-triennial", "city": " Folkestone", "postcode": "CT20 1JR"}, "organizer": {"id": 2498, "name": "Folkestone Triennial", "slug": "folkestone-triennial"}, "date": "2011-06-25", "dates": [{"id": 10290, "from_date": "2011-06-25", "to_date": "2011-06-25", "time": "14:00:00", "ticket_cost": "FREE", "ticket_info": "http://www.folkestonetriennial.org.uk/events/\r\nor call\r\n0845 2020190", "additional_info": "The Folkestone Triennial is a major exhibition of newly commissioned artworks for Folkestone’s streets, squares, beaches and historic buildings. \r\n\r\nPublic dates: 25 June – 25 September 2011.\r\n\r\nHigh-speed trains run from London St. Pancras to Folkestone Central and take approx. 55 minutes: \r\nwww.nationalrail.co.uk\r\n\r\nFollow the project on www.folkestonetriennial.org.uk, twitter and facebook.\r\n", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 2498, "name": "Folkestone Triennial", "slug": "folkestone-triennial", "city": " Folkestone", "postcode": "CT20 1JR"}, "organizer": {"id": 2498, "name": "Folkestone Triennial", "slug": "folkestone-triennial"}}]}, {"id": 9669, "title": "'Ashes in the Wind.

This talk will highlight some of the current activities and programmes that encourage people, in particular children, to recognise, identify and understand plant relationships. \r\n\r\n\r\nGail Bromley is Education Development Manager and International Consultant for Biodiversity Education at Kew.  She has been there for 33 years, working for the first 12 years as a plant taxonomist, specialising in Brazilian Plants.  Gail joined the education team in 1987 and became Head of Department in 1994.  She developed and managed the education provision at Kew, including higher education and professional training, adult education, interpretation / informal education provision, schools programmes and Kew’s first volunteer programme.  She significantly built the learning team at Kew and introduced a volunteer guide force of over 50 to Kew.\r\n\r\nGail moved on from formal education provision to develop her role as national and international advisor and consultant for Kew on botanic garden and biodiversity education and to explore programmes that support sustainable community outreach.  She is responsible for the management of new community education projects and initiatives and for capacity building programmes at home and abroad on education for biodiversity and sustainability.  Currently she is additionally supporting a number of individual Kew projects, such as the The Great Plant Hunt programme for schools and the new interpretation programme for the restored Marianne North Gallery at Kew.\r\n\r\nGail remains passionate about both plants and people and expends a great deal of energy working to encourage communities worldwide to recognise the vital importance of plants and their habitats and to support organisations that deliver plant science and support conservation.  \r\n\r\nGail was awarded the MBE in Jan.2003 for ‘services to education’.  She is a Fellow of the Linnean Society\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIN HIGHER EDUCATION\r\nHis lecture will touch on three inter-related aspects of the problem of how to encourage more taxonomists: stimulation, training and opportunity.  To many, that there is a problem at all is surprising given the unprecedented number and popularity of high profile natural history programmes such as the Attenborough series and Spring Watch.  Indeed, are these part of the problem?  At what point is the life-long interest in natural history borne and what is the spark?  If the spark is no longer being ignited, how do we light it?  Part of the problem is often laid at the door of the universities who, it is claimed, no longer teach formal systematics and taxonomy.  Is this criticism fair and if it is, what is the reason for it?  How much should be laid at the doors of the research councils who increasingly determine national research priorities?  How does the graduate with appropriate skills and interests actually find the job market?  Rather than a lack of taxonomists, is not a lack of opportunities also a problem? \r\n\r\nDavid Streeter MBE is reader in Ecology at the University of Sussex where he was formerly Dean of the School of Biological Sciences and a Pro-Vice-Chancellor and where he designed and convenes the MSc in Biodiversity Survey.  He is a plant ecologist but with interests in all aspects of natural history.  He has been particularly involved with the link between ecology and conservation policy.  He is a past member of the Countryside Commission and the Advisory Committee for England of the Nature Conservancy Council.  He is currently a member of the Conservation Panel of the National Trust and is president of the Sussex Wildlife Trust.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN PROFESSIONAL TAXONOMY\r\nThe impacts of taxonomy go far wider than simply the application of names.  This talk will be illustrated with a range of examples to show how taxonomy and the accurate naming of plants are fundamental to scientists working in a range of subjects including phylogenetics, conservation and forensics.  Taxonomy is not the dull subject it is painted to be, and with the aid of these examples, he hopes to persuade the audience that this is a vibrant, interesting field of research with a real relevance in the 21st century..\r\n\r\nDr Mike Fay has worked at Kew since 1986, and for the last 15 years he has worked in the Jodrell Laboratory, where he is Head of Genetics.  In this position, he is involved in a range of projects using genetic techniques to investigate questions relating to taxonomy, phylogenetics, evolution and conservation.  He is Editor in Chief of the Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society and is currently a Vice President of the Linnean Society.  He is particularly interested in orchids, and he is Chair of the Orchid Specialist Group of the Species Survival Commission of IUCN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 120, "image_id": null, "added": "2009-10-12T11:54:09", "slug": "panel-presentation-and-discussion-inspiring-new-naturalists-and-taxonomists", "speakers": [{"id": 8858, "name": "Gail Bromley", "slug": "gail-bromley"}, {"id": 8859, "name": "David Streeter", "slug": "david-streeter"}, {"id": 8860, "name": "Dr Mike Fay", "slug": "dr-mike-fay"}], "topics": [{"id": 743, "name": "education", "path": "/academic/arts/linguistics/education"}, {"id": 1152, "name": "genetics", "path": "/science/biology/genetics"}, {"id": 1653, "name": "genetics", "path": "/science/evolution/genetics"}, {"id": 157, "name": "chromosomes", "path": "/science/genetics/chromosomes"}], "supercategory": "academic", "venue": {"id": 1212, "name": "Birkbeck, University of London", "slug": "birkbeck-university-of-london", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC1H 0PD"}, "organizer": {"id": 1069, "name": "Ecology and Conservation Studies Society", "slug": "ecology-and-conservation-studies-society"}, "date": "2009-11-20", "dates": [{"id": 7582, "from_date": "2009-11-20", "to_date": "2009-11-20", "time": "18:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": "E-mail:  environmentevents@FLL.bbk.ac.uk  for booking and venue details.

What characterises an interesting starting point -- a \"problem\", as mathematicians tend to say -- for work in mathematics or art? Interesting explorations often begin with a mystery: why does a certain configuration of elements behave as it does? Exploration leads from mystery to insight and understanding, but good problems never lose their capacity to cause wonder. \r\n\r\nWhat are the benefits for mathematicians and artists of understanding each other's ways of working and thinking? There is a stock answer which denies anything in common: mathematical work is all terribly logical and constrained, whereas artists can just be sensual and unconstrained with their paint or whatever. But mathematical creation requires a measure of sensuality and lack of constraint, and artistic creation cannot function without the use of constraints and systems (rules) to generate, for example, the initial marks on the paper, and how they may be re-worked and refined.
