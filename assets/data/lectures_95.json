In a constant effort to maintain a stimulating cultural offer and provide assistance to academic refugees in need, the Warburg Institute established a number of long-lasting collaborations with British institutions such as the Courtauld Institute, the Academic Assistance Council and later the Society for the Protection of Science and Learning (now CARA), the National Buildings Record (NBR) and the Council for the Encouragement of Music and Arts (CEMA).\r\n\r\nThe research here presented shows how the Warburg Institute and its circle reacted to the international crisis of the Second World War through the lens of a series of micro-stories of academic refugees and it is based on unpublished material from the Warburg Institute Archive, the E. H. Gombrich Archive, the Warburg Institute Photographic Collection and the CARA (Council for At-Risk Academics) Archive. \r\n\r\nMaria Teresa Chicote Pompanin is a PhD student in Cultural and Art History at the Warburg Institute (School of Advanced Study, University of London). The main focus of her research is the manipulation of Spanish historiography and historical memory through acts of patronage. In particular, her analysis focuses on the Marquises of Villena’s efforts to overcome the official negative image projected on certain sectors of the nobility by the monarchs between 1445 and 1529. In 2014, she completed the MA in Art History, Curatorship and Renaissance Culture offered by the Warburg Institute and the National Gallery (Distinction). In 2013, she obtained a BA in Art History from the Universidad Complutense of Madrid (summa cum laude).\r\n\r\nHanna Gentili is a PhD student in Cultural and Intellectual History at the Warburg Institute (School of Advanced Study, University of London). Her research focuses on the dynamics of the interreligious dialogue between Jewish and Christian scholars in the Italian cultural context of the late fifteenth century. Other areas of interest include the Jewish notion of cultural identity and early modern aesthetics. She recently completed a MA in Cultural and Intellectual History (1300-1650) at the Warburg Institute. Prior to this she received a MA (summa cum laude) in Philosophy and Forms of Knowledge and a BA in Philosophy at the University of Pisa.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPicture caption: Otto Kurz and Franz Rosenthal in the Library of the Warburg Institute at the Imperial Institute", "additional_info": null, "duration": 60, "image_id": null, "added": "2017-01-17T21:35:08", "slug": "25c7d7b1a611c478", "speakers": [{"id": 16461, "name": "Maria Teresa Chicote Pompanin", "slug": "maria-teresa-chicote-pompanin"}, {"id": 16462, "name": "Hanna Gentili", "slug": "hanna-gentili"}], "topics": [{"id": 107, "name": "wwii", "path": "/arts/books/history/military/wwii"}, {"id": 2692, "name": "history", "path": "/arts/finearts/film/film/history"}, {"id": 106, "name": "wwi", "path": "/arts/books/history/military/wwi"}, {"id": 108, "name": "army", "path": "/arts/books/history/military/army"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 1886, "name": "The Wiener Library for the Study of the Holocaust and Genocide", "slug": "the-wiener-library-for-the-study-of-the-holocaust-and-genocide", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC1B 5DP"}, "organizer": {"id": 1886, "name": "The Wiener Library for the Study of the Holocaust and Genocide", "slug": "the-wiener-library-for-the-study-of-the-holocaust-and-genocide"}, "date": "2017-02-14", "dates": [{"id": 16277, "from_date": "2017-02-14", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "14:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Admission is free, but booking is essential as space is limited", "ticket_info": "http://www.wienerlibrary.co.uk", "additional_info": null, "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 1886, "name": "The Wiener Library for the Study of the Holocaust and Genocide", "slug": "the-wiener-library-for-the-study-of-the-holocaust-and-genocide", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC1B 5DP"}, "organizer": {"id": 1886, "name": "The Wiener Library for the Study of the Holocaust and Genocide", "slug": "the-wiener-library-for-the-study-of-the-holocaust-and-genocide"}}]}, {"id": 15544, "title": "‘Understanding Eritrea: Inside Africa’s Most Repressive State’ with Martin Plaut", "synopsis": "Eritrea is characterised by regime paranoia, intense domestic repression and isolationism.

Some today say that he has the better explanation of boom-bust cycles and how to end them. His prescription is the exact opposite of Keynes – no big infrastructure spending, no keeping things afloat with quantitative easing and cheap credit, but leaner government, lower taxes, less regulation and more freedom for businesses and individuals alike. In this lecture, Hayek biographer Dr Eamonn Butler of the Adam Smith Institute explains Hayek's view that a prosperous economy and a creative society are better achieved by individual freedom than by state planning. This event marks his latest book Friedrich Hayek: The ideas and influence of the libertarian economist|. \r\n\r\nEamonn Butler is director of the Adam Smith Institute, rated one of the world's leading policy think-tanks. He has degrees in economics, philosophy and psychology, gaining a PhD from the University of St Andrews in 1978 and an honorary DLitt from Heriot-Watt University in 2012. During the 1970s he worked on pensions and welfare issues for the US House of Representatives, and taught philosophy in Hillsdale College, Michigan, before returning to the UK to help found the Adam Smith Institute. \r\n\r\nEamonn is author of books on the pioneering economists Milton Friedman, F A Hayek, Ludwig von Mises and Adam Smith, and on the Austrian and Public Choice schools of economics.

Or do they discriminate unfairly against less academic pupils?", "keywords": "Debate, Exams, Education", "body": "For the first time, this year there was a fall in the number of pupils achieving top grades in GCSEs and A-levels. But, as every year, this sparked a row about standards. While some argue that improving results show pupils are getting smarter and working harder, others raise questions about the quality of examinations and school curricula. Many educationalists and commentators argue we have seen a long and steady dumbing down in educational standards, in which traditional subjects have lost rigour, to be replaced by modular courses with multiple re-sits or by vocational qualifications. And exam boards have been accused of being complicit in this process by competing to offer easier courses, leaving schools to shop around for exams that will improve their league table results.\r\n\r\nTo tackle what he sees as this ‘culture of competitive dumbing down’, education secretary Michael Gove plans to replace GCSEs in England from 2014 with a ‘tougher’ O-level-style system alongside a simpler exam for less academic teenagers, like the old CSE. This has provoked charges of ‘elitism’ that it is an attempt to create a ‘two-tier’ education system in which poorer students will be fobbed off with a second-class education. Nevertheless, others argue this shows ignorance of the current exam system within which those deemed less capable are already directed down the path of lower level GCSEs and NVQs. In addition, many private schools already opt for the International GCE (comparable to the old O-level), while increasing numbers of state schools and sixth-form colleges are turning to a baccalaureate system, also favoured by Gove, as a ‘stable’ and ‘safer alternative’ to the grade inflation of A-levels.\r\n\r\nSo, would the return to O-levels create a two-tier, elitist system in education that confines many to the scrapheap? Or is it a step in the right direction to improving academic standards for all? What purpose do exams serve anyway? Are they the best way to assess pupils’ abilities, and an important part of what education should be about? Or do they discriminate unfairly against less academic pupils?\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 120, "image_id": 1748, "added": "2012-09-13T11:56:47", "slug": "0fca8dfe6d66b396", "speakers": [{"id": 10129, "name": "Professor Dennis Hayes", "slug": "professor-dennis-hayes"}, {"id": 12747, "name": "Paul Thomas", "slug": "paul-thomas"}], "topics": [{"id": 743, "name": "education", "path": "/academic/arts/linguistics/education"}, {"id": 942, "name": "debate", "path": "/arts/books/poetry/debate"}, {"id": 1779, "name": "debate", "path": "/arts/books/nonfiction/debate"}, {"id": 2327, "name": "exams", "path": "/academic/education/exams"}], "supercategory": "academic", "venue": {"id": 2740, "name": "White Cloth Gallery", "slug": "white-cloth-gallery", "city": "Leeds ", "postcode": "LS1 4HT"}, "organizer": {"id": 45, "name": "Institute of Ideas", "slug": "institute-of-ideas"}, "date": "2012-10-01", "dates": [{"id": 11875, "from_date": "2012-10-01", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "18:30:00", "ticket_cost": "£4 (£3)", "ticket_info": "www.leedssalon.org.uk", "additional_info": "See www.battleofideas.org.uk for more information", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 2740, "name": "White Cloth Gallery", "slug": "white-cloth-gallery", "city": "Leeds ", "postcode": "LS1 4HT"}, "organizer": {"id": 45, "name": "Institute of Ideas", "slug": "institute-of-ideas"}}]}, {"id": 11350, "title": "The Hazards of Geography: Earthquakes and Landslides – A lecture with Professor David Petley", "synopsis": "Drawing on his experiences of working in Nepal, Pakistan, China and New Zealand after recent earthquakes, Professor Petley explores the ways in which social and natural processes combine to generate disasters.

It is only between these rapid shifts that we see with any clarity. \r\n\r\nThis same strategy of rapid jerks of the eyes is found across many parts of the animal kingdom, from humans to insects to crustaceans and even cephalopod molluscs.

Much of course has changed since Boyle in his Will endowed the original lecture series, but there remain certain parallels between his own time and ours. In the Preface to his book The Christian Virtuoso, Boyle observed the 'great and deplorable growth of irreligion, especially among those that aspired to pass for wits and several of them too for philosophers.' On the other side were their opponents, who by virtue of 'well-meaning but ill-informed zeal, had brought many good men to think that religion and philosophy were incompatible.'\r\n\r\nThe consequence, in Boyle?s words, was that libertines thought a scientific virtuoso ought not to be a Christian and the others that he could not be a true one. My intention in this lecture is to introduce and revisit Boyle himself, who sought to mend this situation. Known to many only as the originator of a 'law' governing the behaviour of gases, Boyle repays closer study as one who thought deeply about the meaning of the word 'nature' and the reality of a spirit world.\r\n\r\nI shall suggest that while many of the assumptions underpinning his natural theology would have to be regarded as obsolete, some of his arguments for the compatibility of theism with the sciences had a depth that enabled them to survive in subsequent religious rhetoric. After noting the longevity and diversity of appeals to 'design' in nature, I shall consider what remains valuable in Boyle?s legacy today.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the 2010 Boyle Lecture at the St. Mary le Bow Church on Cheapside, EC2V 6AU.\r\nProfessor John Hedley Brooke is the Andreas Idreos Professor of Science and Religion, University of Oxford\r\nA response will be given by Professor Geoffrey Cantor, University of Leeds\r\n\r\nThe original Boyle Lectures took place annually between 1692 and 1732. Funded by a bequest in the Will of the Hon Robert Boyle, the lectures featured distinguished preachers who were asked to consider the relationship between the new natural philosophy and the Christian religion. Revived in 2004, the new Boyle Lectures address the same challenge today.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more information, please visit the event's page on our website:\r\nhttp://www.gresham.ac.uk/event.asp?PageId=45&EventId=920", "additional_info": null, "duration": 60, "image_id": 1085, "added": "2009-12-16T14:52:48", "slug": "c303b9be5c920c3f", "speakers": [{"id": 9144, "name": "Professor Hedley Brooke", "slug": "professor-hedley-brooke"}], "topics": [{"id": 571, "name": "science", "path": "/science/science"}, {"id": 69, "name": "science", "path": "/science"}, {"id": 960, "name": "debate", "path": "/science/debate"}, {"id": 65, "name": "religion", "path": "/religion"}, {"id": 1943, "name": "religion", "path": "/society/religion"}, {"id": 223, "name": "science", "path": "/society/science"}, {"id": 1315, "name": "debate", "path": "/society/science/debate"}, {"id": 1327, "name": "scienceculture", "path": "/society/science/scienceculture"}, {"id": 1518, "name": "religion", "path": "/academic/religion"}, {"id": 1525, "name": "religion", "path": "/academic/religion/religion"}, {"id": 1349, "name": "philosophy", "path": "/academic/science/philosophy"}, {"id": 473, "name": "science", "path": "/academic/science"}, {"id": 1511, "name": "religion", "path": "/religion/religion"}, {"id": 164, "name": "history", "path": "/science/history"}, {"id": 807, "name": "historyofscience", "path": "/science/history/historyofscience"}, {"id": 211, "name": "history", "path": "/society/history"}, {"id": 1549, "name": "17thcentury", "path": "/society/history/17thcentury"}, {"id": 349, "name": "history", "path": "/academic/history"}, {"id": 563, "name": "historyofscience", "path": "/academic/historyofscience"}], "supercategory": "science", "venue": {"id": 743, "name": "St Mary le Bow Church", "slug": "st-mary-le-bow-church", "city": "London", "postcode": "EC2V 6AU"}, "organizer": {"id": 20, "name": "Gresham College", "slug": "gresham-college"}, "date": "2010-02-16", "dates": [{"id": 7884, "from_date": "2010-02-16", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "18:00:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": null, "additional_info": "No reservations are required.\r\nThe event will be run on a \"First come, first served\" basis.", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 743, "name": "St Mary le Bow Church", "slug": "st-mary-le-bow-church", "city": "London", "postcode": "EC2V 6AU"}, "organizer": {"id": 20, "name": "Gresham College", "slug": "gresham-college"}}]}, {"id": 7556, "title": "UCL Lunch Hour Lecture", "synopsis": "Love, death and the pursuit of happiness: How evolution invented Hollywood.

They survey the leading ideas and contributions made by their discipline, explain the types of problems that are addressed and the tools that are used, and explore the kinds of solutions proposed. \r\n\r\nThe employment relationship is one of the fundamental institutions of advanced industrial societies for sharing the risks of economic life, in this case, between employer and employee. It lies at the heart of our concept of the modern business enterprise as a coordinator of human economic activity. Its open-ended nature enables firms to hire labour before their detailed production plans are known, which is essential in an uncertain world. It also provides workers with greater predictability and protection in the provision of their services. It emerged as the dominant contractual framework for organising the buying and selling of labour services in all the advanced economies in the last century at a time when the national economy provided the framework for our thinking about economic and social issues. Yet in recent years, it has come under great pressure to change, and many argue it is in crisis. New forms of temporary employment have developed to provide firms with more flexibility, both within and between economies, and these challenge some of the benefits that workers derived from steady employment. Employment law and labour rights have also often taken the employment relationship as their starting point, and struggle to adapt as the relationship itself evolves. Many national social security systems have grown up around the employment relationship, often linking social insurance to employment. These too are under pressure to change on budgetary grounds, as employers balk at high social charges, and because of assumptions about gendered employment patterns which are no longer appropriate. What is the future of the employment relationship, and what the major policy choices that we face in this area? Can it once again become an institutional focus for both economic prosperity and social justice? \r\n\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 60, "image_id": 732, "added": "2009-11-07T23:50:34", "slug": "b896e0891e1ffd68", "speakers": [{"id": 8976, "name": "Professor David  Marsden", "slug": "professor-david-marsden"}], "topics": [{"id": 1855, "name": "management", "path": "/politics/government/management"}, {"id": 1719, "name": "employment", "path": "/society/employment"}, {"id": 1108, "name": "management", "path": "/business/management"}, {"id": 1116, "name": "management", "path": "/academic/management"}], "supercategory": "politics", "venue": {"id": 1519, "name": "Hong Kong Theatre, London School of Economics &Political Science", "slug": "hong-kong-theatre-london-school-of-economics-political-science", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC2A 2AE"}, "organizer": {"id": 1287, "name": "London School of Economics & Political Science", "slug": "london-school-of-economics-political-science"}, "date": "2009-11-19", "dates": [{"id": 7691, "from_date": "2009-11-19", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "13:00:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": "This event is free and open to all with no ticket required.

The Dance Manifesto, launched in 2006, tells us that dance is the fastest growing art form, with millions of people both attending performances and taking part. ‘Community dance’ is the grassroots phenomenon du jour, radically changing the idea that dance as an art form is only about men-in-tights and women-in-tutus. And the most cutting-edge community dance is Street Dance – from hip-hop to krumping – which has been identified by the Department of Children, Schools and Families as an exciting new art form in need of more recognition and public funding. It seems ballet is losing its privileged status, but should is it a case of out with the old and in with the new, or is there something to be said for the elitism of ballet?\r\n\r\nIn 1968, following the assassination of Martin Luther King, the legendary dancer and choreographer Arthur Mitchell returned to New York to set up the Dance Theatre of Harlem to ‘disprove the myth that Negroes can’t do classical ballet’ – a striking contrast to the attitude shown by those now championing community dance. Can something like Street Dance compete with the choreographic traditions and disciplines that have allowed classical ballet choreographers from Balanchine to Wheeldon to continue to astound audiences with their work? Is the opposition between ballet and new dance forms a false one, now that choreographers like Russell Maliphant are incorporating capoeira into classical ballet technique?

On the rolling decks of the slave ship, four distinct but related human dramas were staged, again and again, over the course of the long eighteenth century.

Maybe your Saturday sprees aren’t on Oxford Street – maybe you prefer the King’s Road or Camden. Wherever you shop, your brain is on the lookout for ways to reward itself. So why does it choose to do it with a pair of shoes? Perhaps nothing else we buy contains as much of our self image as our clothes.

A series of experiments will be presented that investigate these questions by looking at effects of similarity between words of the bilingual's two languages in terms of orthography, phonology, and semantics.
