It established the image of an island nation, separate and supreme, still resonant today. It triggered a religious and political redistribution of power.

Holly will talk about her novel and give readings from it, and discuss the inspiration behind it. Set in Nazi-controlled Austria, My Own Dear Brother explores the themes of family loyalty and conflict in a time of war, inspired in part by the author’s own family’s experiences. There will be an opportunity to purchase a signed copy of the novel at a reduced price on the night.\r\n \r\nMy Own Dear Brother\r\nIt is 1944, and war has taken the men in Nazi-controlled Austria to the front line. For thirteen-year-old Ursula Hildesheim life in the village of Felddorf remains almost as it was: bullied by her schoolmates, idly thieving from the village shop, enlisted in endless chores by her mama and sister and running wild with her adored older brother Anton. But when Russian prisoners escape from the local concentration camp, her mama starts an affair with a married man, her friend goes missing and her brother's allegiance to the Hitler Youth emerges in shocking ways, Ursula finds herself alone, disturbed by dark memories, and surrounded by threat. In this new world of conflict, Ursula discovers a bravery she has never known before and is forced to recognise that danger comes not only from the enemy at the door but from the enemy within. My Own Dear Brother is a remarkable coming-of-age story and an unflinching study of both cruelty and courage.

Contrary to the expectation of some people, knowing our genome does not tell us what we will die of, or how long we will live. \r\n\r\nGiven these uncertainties, and given that we share large parts of our genomes with other people (about 50 per cent with siblings, parents, or children, and 100 per cent if you have an identical twin!), the question of whether people should have a right to know their own genome is not straightforward to answer.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, Dr Barbara Prainsack will present the most important arguments for and against – and will be very interested in hearing what you think.

This illustrated lecture is an exercise in regarding history as a panorama rather than as a close-up in considering the global positioning through space and time of a small but influential city. It approaches the evolution of Dublin through a series of flows – of people, ideas, goods, and culture. It tracks Dublin’s rise as a ‘city of brick’, as it surged from a mere 10,000 in 1600 to 200,000 by 1800 - a response to the northwards migration of the centre of gravity of the European economy from its old Mediterranean heart to the Atlantic facade. It anatomises Dublin under the Union, a ‘city of shadows’, as its trade, population and prospects were all constricted. It considers the influence of two global systems -Imperialism, Catholicism – on Dublin in the nineteenth century. The ‘city of words’ emerged in the early twentieth century, when Joyce, Yeats and Beckett found ways to universalize the city. The 1916 Rising is considered, as is the exhausted city of the post-imperial phase. Finally the lecture looks at the emergence of the ‘silicon city’, and how Dublin functions as a transnational city in the current global economy. By looking at Dublin over a long time frame and in a wider geographical frame, its distinctive evolution can be tracked through comparative perspectives.\r\n\r\nBiography: Kevin Whelan was named the inaugural Director of the University of Notre Dame Centre in Dublin in 1998.

How we come to act in this way is economic, both in the sense that we fulfill a profitable role in a politically organized cultural economy, and that our role affirms and maintains the unnameable and abstracted values that sustain the economy of the object we encounter. An alternative animistic and psychoanalytic history of objects exist in which they act on us persuasively. Recent object-oriented philosophies suggest that objects (for instance art objects) need to be decoupled from their subjectification within human cognition. In turn, I want to propose that we, as the publics of objects, desubject ourselves from the economy of spectatorship, however superficially diversified, and demand that exhibitions and their institutions change in favour of our new viewing needs, wherein we are no longer subservient to (the economy of) the objects we encounter.\r\n\r\nAbout Andrea...\r\n\r\nDr Andrea Phillips is Reader in Fine Art and Director of PhD programmes in the Art Department at Goldsmiths University.

Amidst so much death Kulka finds moments of haunting, almost unbearable beauty (for beauty, too, says Kulka, is an inescapable law). But what does it mean to find beauty in Auschwitz? For him, “the blue of the sky in this land is many times stronger than any blue one can see anywhere else.” \r\n\r\nKulka here breaks years of silence, bringing together the personal and historical in a devastating, at times poetic, account of the concentration camps. Returning to the sites of his childhood, Kulka struggles to overcome the obfuscations of memory, unpick the euphemistic language of the camp, and interpret history as he experienced it. These haunting memories – of his mother, who doesn’t look back as she marches towards her death, the sounds of ‘Ode to Joy’ being sung by a children’s choir opposite the crematoria, and the “black stains” along the roadside during the winter death march - instigate forbidden, unanswerable questions. As the author maps his interior world, in a way reminiscent of W. G. Sebald, readers gain a new sense of what it was to experience the Shoah from inside the camps— both at the time, and long afterward. \r\n\r\nA renowned historian of Nazi Germany and the Holocaust, Otto Dov Kulka is Rosenbloom Professor Emeritus in Jewish History at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He was born in Czechoslovakia in 1933. As a child, he was sent first to the ghetto of Theresienstadt and then to Auschwitz. As one of the few survivors he has spent much of his life studying Nazism and the Holocaust, but always as a discipline requiring the greatest coldness and objectivity, with his personal story set to one side. \r\n\r\nIan Kershaw is the author of Hitler 1889-1936: Hubris; Hitler 1936-1945: Nemesis; Making Friends with Hitler; and Fateful Choices: Ten Decisions that Changed the World, 1940-4. Hitler 1936-1945: Nemesis received the Wolfson History Prize and the Bruno Kreisky Prize in Austria for Political Book of the Year, and was joint winner of the inaugural British Academy Book Prize. Until his retirement in 2008, Ian Kershaw was professor of modern history at the University of Sheffield. For services to history he was given the German award of the Federal Cross of Merit in 1994. He was knighted in 2002 and awarded the Norton Medlicott Medal by the Historical Association in 2004. He is a Fellow of the British Academy, and was the winner of the Leipzig Book Prize for European Understanding 2012. \r\n\r\nSuggested hashtag for this event for Twitter users: #LSEKulka \r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 732, "added": "2013-01-14T19:59:46", "slug": "a038fd1389e5ce14", "speakers": [{"id": 13307, "name": "Otto  Dov Kulka", "slug": "otto-dov-kulka"}, {"id": 13308, "name": "Sir Ian  Kershaw ", "slug": "sir-ian-kershaw"}], "topics": [{"id": 107, "name": "wwii", "path": "/arts/books/history/military/wwii"}, {"id": 3256, "name": "auschwitz", "path": "/society/history/holocaust/auschwitz"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 2131, "name": "Old Theatre", "slug": "old-theatre", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC2A 2AE"}, "organizer": {"id": 1287, "name": "London School of Economics & Political Science", "slug": "london-school-of-economics-political-science"}, "date": "2013-01-28", "dates": [{"id": 12479, "from_date": "2013-01-28", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "18:30:00", "ticket_cost": "FREE", "ticket_info": "This event is free and open to all with no ticket required.

With food prices already rising amid deeper environmental concerns, the United Nations and governments worldwide are particularly preoccupied with how we will feed ourselves. An increasing population is overwhelmingly viewed as a matter of more mouths to feed rather than a potential source of solutions. So while feeding the world seems a straightforward technical issue of implementing the most efficient and effective farming practices, a host of extraneous social, political, cultural, even ethical issues seem to thwart the implementation of solutions. The angst-ridden discussion about the pros and cons of growing genetically modified crops is only one example. Meanwhile, Western societies seem disillusioned with the gains of industrialised food production. Factory farming and processed foods are demonised; local, organic, natural are celebrated. \r\n\r\nOne solution is to rethink what we eat completely. With some food futurologists and nutritionists predicting meat will become a luxury even in the West, one proposal to ‘fill the meat gap’ is eating insects. This is no longer a marginal idea, a gross bush-tucker trial from TV’s I’m a Celebrity… jungle. The Dutch government recently invested a million euros into research into getting insects into mainstream diets. British food experts are taking seriously research from Wageningen University that shows insects provide as much nutritional value as ordinary meat. There is of course a ‘yuk factor’ to consider, but those who don’t relish the prospect of crunching through a bug sandwich are assured that crickets and grasshoppers can be ground down to be used in burgers and so on. And after all, a large number of the world’s population already eat insects as a regular part of their diet: caterpillars and locusts are popular in Africa, crickets are eaten in Thailand and we’ve all seen the HSBC advert in which a Cambodian farmer catches flying insects to keep them off his crops, then cooks and sells them. Have Europeans something to learn from the developing world, or are such dietary choices the product of poverty rather than culinary experimentation?\r\n\r\nWhy do most of us find the eating of insects repulsive, but don’t flinch when offered fish eggs, liver, kidney, snails? Might not science and modern-farming methods help us go beyond bug-burgers or should we all just become less squeamish? What are the most palatable ways of solving the world’s food crisis?\r\n\r\nNibbling samples of innovative food solutions will be available to try before the discussion.\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 120, "image_id": 1752, "added": "2012-09-13T15:57:45", "slug": "d9a69551f719b8ba", "speakers": [{"id": 12761, "name": "Louise Bolotin", "slug": "louise-bolotin"}, {"id": 8833, "name": "Mr Rob Lyons", "slug": "mr-rob-lyons"}, {"id": 12762, "name": "Dr Angelica Michelis", "slug": "dr-angelica-michelis"}, {"id": 12763, "name": "Dr Carol Wagstaff", "slug": "dr-carol-wagstaff"}, {"id": 12764, "name": "Craig Fairnington", "slug": "craig-fairnington"}], "topics": [{"id": 80, "name": "society", "path": "/society"}, {"id": 61, "name": "politics", "path": "/politics"}, {"id": 2714, "name": "food", "path": "/science/food/food"}], "supercategory": "society", "venue": {"id": 2744, "name": "Cross Street Chapel", "slug": "cross-street-chapel", "city": "Manchester ", "postcode": "M2 1NL"}, "organizer": {"id": 45, "name": "Institute of Ideas", "slug": "institute-of-ideas"}, "date": "2012-10-29", "dates": [{"id": 11884, "from_date": "2012-10-29", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "18:45:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": "Reserve a ticket via www.manchestersalon.org.uk", "additional_info": "Visit www.battleofideas.org.uk for more information.", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 2744, "name": "Cross Street Chapel", "slug": "cross-street-chapel", "city": "Manchester ", "postcode": "M2 1NL"}, "organizer": {"id": 45, "name": "Institute of Ideas", "slug": "institute-of-ideas"}}]}, {"id": 11343, "title": "David Crystal: A Time and a Place: Where English Came To Be", "synopsis": ".", "keywords": "English language", "body": "For a forthcoming book, 'Wordsmiths and Warriors', David and Hilary Crystal have been visiting the places in Britain where significant events influenced the shape and study of the English language.

It began life as term of abuse invented by the Conservative-supporting press in the 1980s as a way of attacking the Labour Party in general and London Labour councils in particular, especially those that were perceived as supporting causes that fell outside the consensus of mainstream political debate. After the initial attacks, which in addition to London councils, included Ken Livingstone's Greater London Council, the term was used by New Labour in its attempts to convince the public that the Party was now ‘respectable’. And although many of the causes the ’loony left’ fought for, are now mainstream, the term  remains one of political abuse - sometimes in its original form and sometimes under the umbrella of ‘political correctness’. The rise of the phenomenon will be examined followed by two specific examples - the reporting of the introduction of the congestion charge by Ken Livingstone, and the treatment of social workers, in particular in the reporting of the events in Haringey surrounding the deaths of Victoria Climbié and Baby P.\r\n\r\nFollowed by the debate: What are todays political battle lines in London?\r\n\r\nPanel: Lord Toby Harris (Chair), Joy Johnson, Shelia Gunn MBE & Andrew Hosken\r\n\r\nThe issues raised by this talk relate to London’s contemporary political and social history. Accepting the fact that Labour in London did, in the 1980s, move to the left, how fairly did the media represent this trend? Was any lasting damage done to London and Londoners by this representation? And did it have any lasting national political impact? Are media representations of ‘political correctness’ similar to their portrayal of the ‘loony left’ and to what extent have there been, perhaps unintended, social effects resulting from this portrayal? Finally, what has been its impact on London politics?

Drawing upon a triangular analytical framework and original empirical data, he will seek to explain the complex relationships between the dynamic articulation of these leading Asian firms into different global production networks and their simultaneous upgrading from typical followers to market leaders. He will argue that the interplay between corporate strategies and home base advantages within the context of changing global production networks can offer a better explanation of the differentiated competitive outcomes of these Asian firms. He will conclude the lecture with some implications for theory and policy in relation to corporate development in Asian economies. \r\n\r\nBorn in Guangzhou, China, Henry Wai-chung Yeung emigrated with my family to Hong Kong in 1979 moving to Singapore in 1988. He graduated with B.A. First Class Honours in Geography from the National University of Singapore and obtained his Ph.D. from the School of Geography, University of Manchester in England in 1995, returning to Singapore to start his career at the Department of Geography, National University of Singapore. Since 2005, he has been Professor of Economic Geography. \r\n\r\nHis research interests cover broadly theories and the geography of transnational corporations, Asian firms and their overseas operations and Chinese business networks in the Asia-Pacific region.

Is access to water and sanitation services a public good or a human right? Should water be treated as a commodity? What is the value of water? Is it possible to universalise access to water and sanitation services in poor countries? Do we even have the technology and know-how to tackle the world water crisis? Are we facing the real possibility of international water wars? \r\n\r\nThese and other important questions will be the focus of a special public event hosted by Newcastle University’s School of Geography, Politics & Sociology and the Newcastle Institute for Research on Sustainability (NIRES) on Thursday 14 July 2011 from 9am to 1pm and 6pm to 9pm. \r\nLeading experts and scientists from the UK, Brazil, Finland, France, Kenya, Mexico, Palestine and Spain, are coming to Newcastle to highlight and debate the main challenges and opportunities facing the international community when it comes to the current global water crisis. \r\n\r\nJust looking at one aspect of the global water crisis, 17 per cent of the world population lacks access to essential volumes of clean drinking water and 40 per cent has no access to basic sanitation. The international community has the goal to universalize access to these services by 2025, which means a massive effort requiring increased freshwater withdrawal and inevitably the release of vast volumes of wastewater as a result. \r\n\r\nWith many countries already experiencing water shortages and heavy pollution of freshwater resources the challenges ahead are overwhelming. The panel of invited water experts and scientists will address this and other aspects of the global water crisis. One of the main messages will be that that the preservation and availability of clean water crucially depends on the development of forms of water governance and management that are grounded on the principles of equality and sustainability. \r\n\r\nThis means overcoming rigid disciplinary boundaries to bring together expertise from across the social, natural and technical sciences.

This talk will be a great opportunity to explore the impact that communities can have on design quality and vice versa.\"    \r\n\r\nThe Prince's Foundation pioneered the ‘Enquiry by Design’ process to bring community engagement and urban design into the same forum.  At the heart of the organisation's work is a belief that neighbourhoods will accept new development that they understand and which reflects recognisable characteristics of the place.\r\n\r\nJames Hulme, Director of Policy for The Prince’s Foundation, says: \"local people's appetite for collaborative planning, and for development generally, will be stimulated if consultation is seen as a transparent process with demonstrable influence on the final design of schemes.\"\r\n\r\nNicole Crockett, Chief Executive of The Building Exploratory, will present their approach to working with communities to celebrating place and the role that knowledge and creativity plays in engaging people with change. She will discuss the recently completed Kilburn Grange Adventure Playground.\r\n\r\nLee Mallett, who is chairing this debate, comments: “I’m all for community engagement.

Over 18,000 babies and young children were left at the Foundling Hospital between its opening in 1741 and the end of the eighteenth century. \r\n\r\nWe know almost nothing about the emotional experiences of any of them. However, we can tease out something of the emotional bonds that existed between these children and their parents by examining the letters and tokens left with them. Very few of these children were ever taken back by their families, but this was not the end of their experiences of family life. Most were sent to be wet nursed in foster homes in the countryside, and here too, we can see some evidence of their experiences via the letters written by the inspectors of nurses back to the hospital. Not all of these experiences were happy, but this talk will illustrate how much the Foundling Hospital records can tell us about mothering, nurture and the model of childhood in the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\nDr Alysa Levene is a Senior Lecturer at Oxford Brookes University and author of Childcare, health and mortality at the London Foundling Hospital, 1741-1800: 'left to the mercy of the world' (Manchester University Press, 2007).

The Home Office's other responsibilities included developing a cross departmental programme to reduce crime and anti social behaviour, government oversight of policing, coordinating the Criminal Justice System, combating the misuse of drugs, protecting the public and reducing reoffending through the prison and probation services, race equality, the voluntary and community sector, passports and the identity card scheme, and immigration and asylum. \r\n\r\nBefore the Home Office he spent twenty years at the Treasury, where he worked on banking and City regulation, energy, public services and the Budget and was Private Secretary to three Chancellors - Lawson, Major and Lamont Chief Secretary.

Wells and Augustus John as well as The Great Beast.  This eccentric also kept at the house a menagerie of animals including a boxing kangaroo, honey bear, baboon and macaw.

The Battle of Ideas is a new annual festival bringing together different strands of social, political, scientific, academic and cultural discussion. This reflects the IoI’s interest in how broad themes, from contemporary risk aversion to the ‘respect’ agenda, affect a variety of debates. \r\n\r\nNever has a Battle of Ideas been so urgent. Since we conceived the festival, Prime Minister Tony Blair has called for a ‘battle of ideas’ in response to the London bombings on 7/7. He knows a good slogan when he sees it, but unfortunately, many of the government’s policy proposals since then seem more about closing down debate than opening it up. Laws curtailing free expression, and a general climate of inoffensive conformism, are anathema to the IoI’s aim of creating a space in which issues can be openly argued over. Free speech is not an abstract principle; it is crucial for tackling the problems society faces. It is free speech that enables different interpretations of the world to be debated on their merits.\r\n\r\nIn this spirit, we have brought together a diverse group of partners and sponsors around six themed strands covering everything from books to international relations. These run alongside keynote debates, café conversations, provocation lectures and film screenings. We are delighted that the Royal College of Art, a working art college rather than a traditional conference venue, has joined with us to allow all these debates to take place under one roof. This allows attendees either to follow strands through one day, or mix and match discussions.

Bruce Ingham has researched the dialects and oral tradition of the bedouin since the 1980s and still regularly visits the Al Dhafir bedouin in their tribal centre at Al Sufairi near Hafar al Batin in northern Saudi Arabia. Slides will be shown of bedouin life among the Al Murra and Al Dhafir tribes.\r\n\r\nHistorians usually date the beginning of the bedouin way of life as we know it, to around the beginnings of the Christian era, growing out of the Nabatean Kingdoms of Northern Arabia. The Nabateans left us the ruins of Petra in Jordan and Palmyra in Syria, now famous tourist attractions. It is thought that the appearance of the bedouin followed the demise of those kingdoms resulting from the decline in the spice trade, which is thought to have been the main basis of their prosperity. The Nabateans are said to have evolved the use of camel cavalry, by adapting for camels the saddle arch used by the Persians for horses. The bedouins then continued this camel technology for use in a nomadic way of life.\r\n\r\nThe present bedouin tribal units in some cases bear the names of those of the early Islamic era and may in fact be related to them. Many however are tribal units, which originate in the more recent centuries.\r\n\r\nIn the present day many bedouin do retain their old nomadic way of life. However the modern era has provided a variety of new occupations, which still enable many of them retain some link with the desert life. Others, because of the spread of education, have entered occupations associated with the modern economy, but still retain an interest in their culture and history.\r\n\r\nProfessor Bruce Ingham's Inaugural Lecture. \r\nChair: Professor Otto Jastrow, Lehrstuhl Orientalische Philologie, Universitat Erlangen- Nurnberg", "additional_info": null, "duration": 60, "image_id": 253, "added": "2005-01-15T11:54:48", "slug": "5b5957344c295251", "speakers": [{"id": 1872, "name": "Professor Bruce Ingham", "slug": "professor-bruce-ingham"}], "topics": [{"id": 61, "name": "politics", "path": "/politics"}, {"id": 1, "name": "academic", "path": "/academic"}, {"id": 80, "name": "society", "path": "/society"}, {"id": 348, "name": "anthropology", "path": "/academic/anthropology"}, {"id": 349, "name": "history", "path": "/academic/history"}, {"id": 88, "name": "linguistics", "path": "/academic/linguistics"}, {"id": 377, "name": "language", "path": "/academic/language"}, {"id": 93, "name": "sociology", "path": "/academic/sociology"}, {"id": 575, "name": "middleeast", "path": "/academic/anthropology/middleeast"}, {"id": 575, "name": "middleeast", "path": "/academic/anthropology/middleeast"}, {"id": 576, "name": "bedouin", "path": "/academic/anthropology/bedouin"}, {"id": 576, "name": "bedouin", "path": "/academic/anthropology/bedouin"}, {"id": 577, "name": "middleeast", "path": "/academic/history/middleeast"}, {"id": 577, "name": "middleeast", "path": "/academic/history/middleeast"}, {"id": 578, "name": "arabia", "path": "/academic/history/arabia"}, {"id": 578, "name": "arabia", "path": "/academic/history/arabia"}, {"id": 579, "name": "arabic", "path": "/academic/language/arabic"}, {"id": 579, "name": "arabic", "path": "/academic/language/arabic"}, {"id": 580, "name": "dialect", "path": "/academic/linguistics/dialect"}, {"id": 580, "name": "dialect", "path": "/academic/linguistics/dialect"}, {"id": 581, "name": "dialectology", "path": "/academic/linguistics/dialectology"}, {"id": 581, "name": "dialectology", "path": "/academic/linguistics/dialectology"}, {"id": 529, "name": "middleeast", "path": "/politics/middleeast"}, {"id": 340, "name": "culturalidentity", "path": "/society/culturalidentity"}, {"id": 339, "name": "ethnicity", "path": "/society/ethnicity"}, {"id": 211, "name": "history", "path": "/society/history"}, {"id": 369, "name": "politics", "path": "/society/politics"}], "supercategory": "politics", "venue": {"id": 411, "name": "Press and Information Office, SOAS", "slug": "press-and-information-office-soas", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC1 OXG"}, "organizer": {"id": 411, "name": "Press and Information Office, SOAS", "slug": "press-and-information-office-soas"}, "date": "2005-01-19", "dates": [{"id": 1548, "from_date": "2005-01-19", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "17:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": "Open Event: No advanced booking necessary", "additional_info": "Enquiries to mo2@soas.ac.uk", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 411, "name": "Press and Information Office, SOAS", "slug": "press-and-information-office-soas", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC1 OXG"}, "organizer": {"id": 411, "name": "Press and Information Office, SOAS", "slug": "press-and-information-office-soas"}}]}, {"id": 1281, "title": "The x-change: Genes and Drugs", "synopsis": "Does medicine discriminate by race?
