The experiments have been described as ‘pseudo-science’ and viewed as a precursor to the killing centres of the Holocaust.\r\n\r\nYet many respected German scientists, research institutes and funding bodies were intimately involved in coerced experiments and research. Medical practitioners seized opportunities offered by war and genocide to advance scientific agendas, without regard for the moral and ethical consequences of human exploitation.\r\n\r\nBased on the ground-breaking research of Wellcome Trust Professor at Oxford Brookes University, Paul Weindling, this exhibition examines coerced experimentation in Nazi-dominated Europe.

It reveals a fascinating and relevant part of our national and international history which has been previously obscured.\r\n\r\nIn 1570, when it became clear she would never be gathered into the Catholic fold, Elizabeth I was excommunicated by the Pope. On the principle that ‘my enemy’s enemy is my friend’, this marked the beginning of an extraordinary English alignment with the Muslim powers who were fighting Catholic Spain in the Mediterranean, and of cultural, economic and political exchanges with the Islamic world of a depth not again experienced until the modern age. England signed treaties with the Ottoman Porte, received ambassadors from the kings of Morocco and shipped munitions to Marrakesh. By the late 1580s hundreds, perhaps thousands, of Elizabethan merchants, diplomats, sailors, artisans and privateers were plying their trade from Morocco to Persia. The awareness of Islam which these Englishmen brought home found its way into many of the great cultural productions of the day, including most famously Marlowe’s Tamburlaine, and Shakespeare’s Titus Andronicus and The Merchant of Venice. The year after Dallam’s expedition the Moroccan ambassador, Abd al-Wahid bin Mohammed al-Annuri, spent six months in London with his entourage. Shakespeare wrote Othello six months later.\r\n\r\nThis Orient Isle shows that England’s relations with the Muslim world were far more extensive, and often more amicable, than we have appreciated, and that their influence was felt across the political, commercial and domestic landscape of Elizabethan England. It is a startlingly unfamiliar picture of part of our national and international history.\r\n\r\nJerry Brotton is Professor of Renaissance Studies at Queen Mary University of London.

A drinks reception will follow this lecture.\r\n\r\nTitle: Choosing not to be discrete — the benefits of fluid approximations in dynamic modelling\r\n\r\nAbstract: Discrete representations of systems are usual in theoretical computer science and they have many benefits. Many discrete state models have been shown to be useful for capturing and analysing dynamic system behaviour. Examples include finite state machines and continuous time Markov chains. Unfortunately these models suffer from the problem of state space explosion, sometimes termed the \"curse of dimensionality”. In recent years, research has shown that there are cases in which we can reap the benefits of discrete representation during system description but then gain from more efficient analysis by approximating the discrete system by a continuous one. In this talk I will give the intuition behind this shift of perspective and explain how it allows us to study and predict the behaviour of the systems which would otherwise have been beyond analysis.\r\n\r\nBiography: Jane Hillston is Professor of Quantitative Modelling in the School of Informatics at the University of Edinburgh. Her principal research interests are in the design of formal modelling languages, particularly stochastic process algebras, to model and analyse dynamic systems and the development of efficient solution techniques for such models. These models capture both engineered computer systems and naturally occurring systems such as  biochemical pathways and the spread of disease within a population. Prof Hillston received the BA and MS degrees in Mathematics from the University of York (UK) and Lehigh University (USA), respectively. She received the PhD degree in Computer Science from the University of Edinburgh in 1994. Her work on the stochastic process algebra PEPA was recognised by the British Computer Society in 2004 who awarded her the first Roger Needham Award. She was elected to fellowship of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 2007. She is also a fellow of the British Computer Society and a member of the executive committee of Informatics Europe.\r\n\r\nAll are welcome and attendance is free.

What had been a minor regional school achieved international prominence and influenced the future of European art in general for centuries. Central to this achievement was the genius of a succession of painters from Giovanni Bellini and his brother Gentile, Carpaccio, Giorgione, to the great Titian and his younger contemporaries Tintoretto and Veronese. These painters worked in a city undergoing crisis and change: the decline of its maritime empire, the reduction of its monopoly of trade with the East, its near destruction as a state in the early sixteenth century, and the religious turmoil engendered by the Reformation and the reaction of the Roman Church to it. Governed by an oligarchy of merchant nobles who elected a Doge, Venice remained politically stable throughout this turbulent period and continued to flourish economically. The state, the lay confraternities (called scuole) and private individuals provided sufficient patronage and support for a brilliant school of painting to develop in both secular and religious art. The cultural context and history of this school will be studied in eight lectures, followed by a full-day visit to the National Gallery to consider first-hand its outstanding collection of Venetian renaissance paintings.\r\n \r\n\r\n", "keywords": "arts, art, history, Renaissance Venice, Giovanni Bellini, Antonello da Messina, 'Sacra Conversazione', Titian, public paintings, eligious paintings, Habsburg rulers, Van Dyck", "body": "There was less of an emphasis on individual identity and personal expression in Venice than in contemporary Florence but an important school of portraiture did emerge here in this period. Antonello da Messina again proved an important stimulus, painting in oil and in the Netherlandish manner. Giovanni Bellini continued to supply restrained, small-scale images of the ruling class. By the early 1500s however a less impersonal, more romantic style of portraiture had been forged in the circle of Giorgione. His pupil Titian was to mint a type of grand portrait that he then exported first to northern Italian princelings and then to the Habsburg rulers of much of the known world: this in turn was to become the basis of European court portraiture through to Van Dyck. This kind of portrait was very different in character from the more idiosyncratic renderings by Lorenzo Lotto of his less exalted sitters.", "additional_info": null, "duration": 300, "image_id": null, "added": "2014-05-02T09:34:45", "slug": "a6a11621e2e91631", "speakers": [{"id": 14666, "name": "Dr Michael Douglas-Scott", "slug": "dr-michael-douglas-scott"}], "topics": [{"id": 131, "name": "authors", "path": "/arts/literature/fiction/british/21stcentury/authors"}, {"id": 106, "name": "wwi", "path": "/arts/books/history/military/wwi"}, {"id": 107, "name": "wwii", "path": "/arts/books/history/military/wwii"}, {"id": 108, "name": "army", "path": "/arts/books/history/military/army"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 2725, "name": "The University Women's Club", "slug": "the-university-womens-club", "city": "London", "postcode": "W1K 1DB"}, "organizer": {"id": 2290, "name": "THE COURSE", "slug": "the-course"}, "date": "2014-10-23", "dates": [{"id": 14174, "from_date": "2014-10-23", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "10:45:00", "ticket_cost": "£46", "ticket_info": "info@thecoursestudies.co.uk", "additional_info": "visit www.thecoursestudies.co.uk", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 2725, "name": "The University Women's Club", "slug": "the-university-womens-club", "city": "London", "postcode": "W1K 1DB"}, "organizer": {"id": 2290, "name": "THE COURSE", "slug": "the-course"}}]}, {"id": 13663, "title": "The English Renaissance: England Under The Tudors / What Did The Tudors Do For Us?", "synopsis": "The Tudors have become the most glamorous and mythologised of English dynasties but they ruled England for barely 100 years.

The first thought is that morality must be learned: children must come to see what morality requires of them and acquire the motivation to submit to its authority. The second thought is that morality is controversial: there is deep uncertainty about both the requirements of morality and the reasons to comply with them. The tension between these thoughts is not hard to discern: the former seems to demand that children are educated in morality; the latter seems to prohibit it. Unless we teach children to subscribe to moral standards, there is no reason to expect that they will come to do so; but to engage in such teaching in the face of controversy about the content and justification of morality appears tantamount to indoctrination.

At the age of nineteen, she began to travel the globe. Aspiring to understand the world and live a significant life, she backpacked through Latin America, Laos, In war-ridden Afghanistan and Iraq she carved out a fledgling career as a television reporter. And then, in August 2008, she travelled to Somalia—“the most dangerous place on earth.” On her fourth day, she was abducted by a group of masked men along a dusty road. \r\n\r\nHeld hostage for 460 days, Amanda converts to Islam as a survival tactic, receives “wife lessons” from one of her captors, and risks a daring escape. Moved between a series of abandoned houses in the desert, she survives on memory—every lush detail of the world she experienced in her life before captivity—and on strategy, fortitude, and hope. When she is most desperate, she visits a house in the sky, high above the woman kept in chains, in the dark, being tortured. \r\n\r\nVivid and suspenseful, hers is the searingly intimate story of an intrepid young woman and her search for compassion in the face of unimaginable adversity. A captivating, unforgettable speaker, Lindhout alights on the positive and leaves the audience with a fuller understanding of the freedom we can all experience when we choose to embrace compassion. What emerges is a celebration of resilience — a powerful portrait of the strength of the human spirit. \r\n\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 732, "added": "2014-02-07T17:09:31", "slug": "d014b10db50403a8", "speakers": [{"id": 14494, "name": "Amanda  Lindhout ", "slug": "amanda-lindhout"}], "topics": [{"id": 3105, "name": "africa", "path": "/business/economy/growth/southasia/africa"}, {"id": 2760, "name": "international", "path": "/academic/law/humanrightslaw/international"}, {"id": 781, "name": "islam", "path": "/arts/historyofart/persia/islam"}, {"id": 1224, "name": "africa", "path": "/arts/photography/photojournalism/africa"}], "supercategory": "business", "venue": {"id": 2130, "name": "New Theatre", "slug": "new-theatre", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC2A 2AE"}, "organizer": {"id": 1287, "name": "London School of Economics & Political Science", "slug": "london-school-of-economics-political-science"}, "date": "2014-04-03", "dates": [{"id": 13964, "from_date": "2014-04-03", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "18:30:00", "ticket_cost": "FREE", "ticket_info": "This event is free and open to all with no ticket required.

Without forecasting artistic trends or predicting future creation, 89plus manifests itself through panels, books, periodicals and exhibitions, bringing together individuals from a generation whose voices are only starting to be heard, yet which makes up nearly half of the world's population.\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 120, "image_id": null, "added": "2013-10-04T18:45:10", "slug": "serpentine-gallery-89plus-marathon", "speakers": [{"id": 4126, "name": "Hans Ulrich Obrist", "slug": "hans-ulrich-obrist"}], "topics": [{"id": 131, "name": "authors", "path": "/arts/literature/fiction/british/21stcentury/authors"}, {"id": 130, "name": "21stcentury", "path": "/arts/literature/fiction/british/21stcentury"}, {"id": 170, "name": "newtopic", "path": "/science/chemistry/biochemistry/catalysis/newtopic"}, {"id": 2893, "name": "architecture", "path": "/sport/olympics/londonolympics2012/architecture"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 2926, "name": "Serpentine Sackler Gallery", "slug": "serpentine-sackler-gallery", "city": "London", "postcode": "W2 2AR"}, "organizer": {"id": 166, "name": "Serpentine Galleries", "slug": "serpentine-galleries"}, "date": "2013-10-18", "dates": [{"id": 13594, "from_date": "2013-10-18", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "20:00:00", "ticket_cost": "Standard - One-day £15.50/£10.00, Standard - Two-day £20.00/£15.00 ", "ticket_info": "Standard - One-day £15.50\r\nConcession - One-day £10.00\r\n\r\nStandard - Two-day £20.00\r\nConcession - Two-day £15.00\r\n\r\nhttp://www.ticketweb.co.uk/search.php?tm_link=tm_header_search&language=en-us&keyword=89plus+marathon\r\n", "additional_info": "Tickets sold on the day at Serpentine Galleries", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 2926, "name": "Serpentine Sackler Gallery", "slug": "serpentine-sackler-gallery", "city": "London", "postcode": "W2 2AR"}, "organizer": {"id": 166, "name": "Serpentine Galleries", "slug": "serpentine-galleries"}}]}, {"id": 12722, "title": "Family Fun Day: Space", "synopsis": "\r\n\r\nFind out everything you ever wanted to know about space with hands-on activities, demonstrations and a captivating talk from Jim Al-Khalili.", "keywords": "space", "body": "Have you ever wondered what lies beyond the clouds?

He gained his PhD in Sociology of Religion from the London School of Economics in 2009.

Opinion polls show that the majority of the general public accepts that paranormal phenomena do occur. Such widespread experience of and belief in the paranormal can only mean one of two things. Either the paranormal is real, in which case this should be accepted by the wider scientific community which currently rejects such claims; or else belief in and experience of ostensibly paranormal phenomena can be fully explained in terms of psychological factors. This presentation will provide an introduction to the sub-discipline of anomalistic psychology, which may be defined as the study of extraordinary phenomena of behaviour and experience, in an attempt to provide non-paranormal explanations in terms of known psychological and physical factors. This approach will be illustrated with examples relating to a range of ostensibly paranormal phenomena.\r\n\r\nProfessor Chris French is the Head of the Anomalistic Psychology Research Unit in the Psychology Department at Goldsmiths, University of London.\r\nHe is a Fellow of the British Psychological Society and of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry, a Distinguished Supporter of the British Humanist Association and a member of the Scientific and Professional Advisory Board of the British False Memory Society.\r\n\r\nHe has published over 100 articles and chapters covering a wide range of topics within psychology.\r\nHis main area of research is the psychology of paranormal beliefs and anomalous experiences.\r\nHe frequently appears on radio and television casting a sceptical eye over paranormal claims, as well as writing for the Guardian and The Skeptic magazine which, for more than a decade, he also edited.\r\nHis most recent books are Why Statues Weep: The Best of The Skeptic, co-edited with Wendy Grossman (2010, London: The Philosophy Press) and Anomalistic Psychology, co-authored with Nicola Holt, Christine Simmonds-Moore, and David Luke (2012, London: Palgrave).\r\n\r\nFollow him on Twitter: @chriscfrench\r\n\r\n\r\nAll our talks are open to the public and free to attend but we ask those who can to make a donation of what they can afford to cover the costs of room and equipment hire and help keep our talks free to all.", "additional_info": null, "duration": 120, "image_id": null, "added": "2013-03-26T07:43:44", "slug": "weird-science-an-introduction-to-anomalistic-psychology", "speakers": [{"id": 6234, "name": "Professor   Chris French", "slug": "professor-chris-french"}], "topics": [{"id": 148, "name": "psychology", "path": "/science/psychology"}, {"id": 1822, "name": "philosophy", "path": "/academic/religion/religion/philosophy"}, {"id": 2388, "name": "philosophy", "path": "/arts/literature/philosophy/philosophy"}, {"id": 910, "name": "science", "path": "/arts/film/documentary/science"}, {"id": 1680, "name": "psychicalresearch", "path": "/science/psychicalresearch"}, {"id": 146, "name": "brain", "path": "/science/brain"}, {"id": 1536, "name": "humannature", "path": "/science/humannature"}, {"id": 1594, "name": "neuroscience", "path": "/science/neuroscience"}, {"id": 817, "name": "publicunderstandingofscience", "path": "/science/publicunderstandingofscience"}], "supercategory": "science", "venue": {"id": 1620, "name": "SPES", "slug": "spes", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC1R 4RL"}, "organizer": {"id": 1620, "name": "SPES", "slug": "spes"}, "date": "2013-04-18", "dates": [{"id": 12741, "from_date": "2013-04-18", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "18:30:00", "ticket_cost": "£2", "ticket_info": "All our talks are open to the public and free to attend but we ask those who can to make a donation of what they can afford to cover the costs of room and equipment hire and help keep our talks free to all.", "additional_info": null, "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 1620, "name": "SPES", "slug": "spes", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC1R 4RL"}, "organizer": {"id": 1620, "name": "SPES", "slug": "spes"}}]}, {"id": 11817, "title": "Monthly Event ::: Meditation for the world around us", "synopsis": "Inner Space - Meditation & personal development centre, a free community initiative courses to help you relax easily, live harmoniously, work calmly, think deeply.", "keywords": "Inner Space - Meditation & personal development centre, a free community initiative courses to help you relax easily, live harmoniously, work calmly, think deeply.", "body": "20/1/2013 18:15 – 19:30\r\nEvery 3rd Sunday of the month, over a million people in over 100 countries for 60 minutes actively share thoughts of peace & calm with our troubled world.

For those who didn’t manage a visit in those 60 years up some foul and dark stairs on Dean Street, Soho, missed a visual treat and a sociological experiment in creative living. For the Colony was an Arts club for the most important artists, ballet dancers, composers, poets, writers, MP’s, journalists, architects, gangsters, designers, directors, photographers, publishers, critics, musicians, academics, thinkers, fashionistas, actors, lords and ladies. Many like Dylan Thomas, Tallulah Bankhead, Nina Hamnett, Jeffery Bernard, Robert Carrier, George Melly, Jean Muir and Francis Bacon, had gigantic ego’s but all left them outside the green door before entering. \r\n\r\nThe Colony was a private party for outsiders and ostracised members of society. Whether you were black, gay, female, an artist or poet, or just liked them.Like other legendary meeting places, such as Les Deux Magots in Paris’ Left Bank, or Dean’s bar in Tangier, the Colony was a place where its guests felt more at home than home. From this small green room in post war Soho, London, the creative juices mingled that would enable Britain to rebuild itself from austerity into a vibrant artistic country.\r\n\r\nNot for small children or the delicate, this lecture will use foul language liberally in describing the true stories of art and poetry . \r\n\r\n\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 60, "image_id": null, "added": "2012-11-17T20:26:15", "slug": "the-colony-room", "speakers": [{"id": 13141, "name": "Miss Sophie Parkin", "slug": "miss-sophie-parkin"}], "topics": [{"id": 604, "name": "poetry", "path": "/arts/language/translation/fromfrench/poetry"}, {"id": 2394, "name": "poetry", "path": "/arts/literature/poetry/poet/poetry"}, {"id": 2451, "name": "poetry", "path": "/academic/arts/linguistics/stylistics/poetry"}, {"id": 1026, "name": "artists", "path": "/religion/islam/women/artists"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 2153, "name": "The Wheatsheaf", "slug": "the-wheatsheaf", "city": "London ", "postcode": "W1T 1DG"}, "organizer": {"id": 2149, "name": "Sohemian Society", "slug": "sohemian-society"}, "date": "2012-12-03", "dates": [{"id": 12269, "from_date": "2012-12-03", "to_date": "2012-12-03", "time": "19:30:00", "ticket_cost": "£3", "ticket_info": "From door on evening.", "additional_info": "Website:www.sohemians.com", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 2153, "name": "The Wheatsheaf", "slug": "the-wheatsheaf", "city": "London ", "postcode": "W1T 1DG"}, "organizer": {"id": 2149, "name": "Sohemian Society", "slug": "sohemian-society"}}]}, {"id": 11773, "title": "Monthly Event ::: Meditation for the world around us", "synopsis": "!/assets/images/1805.jpg!\r\n\r\nInner Space - Meditation & personal development centre, a free community initiative courses to help you relax easily, live harmoniously, work calmly, think deeply.", "keywords": "positive thinking, spiritual, health, well being,", "body": "18/11/2012 18:15 – 19:30\r\nEvery 3rd Sunday of the month, over a million people in over 100 countries for 60 minutes actively share thoughts of peace & calm with our troubled world.

If so, how can we prevent market values from reaching into spheres of life where they don't belong? What are the moral limits of markets? \r\n\r\nNoted public philosopher and Harvard professor Michael J. Sandel will explore some of these pressing questions with responses from Bishop Peter Selby. St Paul's Cathedral is delighted to host a discussion on this vital topic within a sacred space in order to explore the intersection between faith, morality and markets and the power that money has in our lives. Questions and comments from the audience will be taken. \r\n\r\nMichael J. Sandel is the Anne T. and Robert M. Bass Professor of Government at Harvard University, where he has taught political philosophy since 1980. His recent book, Justice: What's the Right Thing to Do? relates the big questions of political philosophy to the most vexing issues of our time. His new book, What Money Can't Buy: The Moral Limits of Markets|, has just been published. At Harvard, Sandel's courses include Ethics, Biotechnology, and the Future of Human Nature, Ethics, Economics, and Law, and Globalization and Its Critics. His undergraduate course, Justice|, has enrolled over 15,000 students, and is the first Harvard course to be made freely available online and on public television. A recipient of the Harvard-Radcliffe Phi Beta Kappa Teaching Prize, Sandel was recognised by the American Political Science Association in 2008 for a career of excellence in teaching.  He has been a visiting professor at the Sorbonne (Paris), delivered the Tanner Lectures on Human Values at Oxford University, and in 2009 delivered the BBC Reith Lectures. In 2010, China Newsweek named him the \"most influential foreign figure of the year\" in China. \r\n\r\nDr Peter Selby was Bishop of Worcester from 1997 until 2007 and in 2001 was also appointed to Bishop of Prisons, a post from which he also retired in September 2007.  Dr Selby's interest in prisons is long-standing, and he is himself the son of refugees, and served for a time as the Chair of the Asylum Committee of the Refugee Council. His concern for prisons and the criminal justice system extends back to 1965 when he served as an interim chaplain at San Quentin, California, as part of his ministerial training. Since then, criminal justice and refugee issues have been consistent features of his work in the Church of England.

Perhaps this agenda should include more discussion of the meaning of the term ‘measurement error’? But will that term be unhelpfully misunderstood? This seminar will also address the current moves to improve in-school assessment practice and will ask if such moves will produce greater reliability and confidence in the system.\r\n\r\nThis seminar is part of the Assessment Principles series of seminars presented by Andrew Watts, a Principal Consultant for the Cambridge Assessment Network Division. The series focuses on five key topics in assessment: the purposes of assessment; the relationship between assessment and learning; the development of assessments; the validity and the reliability of assessments. Each session addresses one of these topics. Though the topics are the same each year, up-to-date issues are discussed which focus on recent news stories or which represent the latest thinking in that area. The series is for those who want to take a broad view of the field of educational assessment, in company with others working in the field. Participants will be able to share their own experiences and perceptions, and to reflect on those of others.

As superintendent of the Calcutta Botanic Garden (1817-1846), Wallich undertook botanical expeditions, described new plant species, amassed a large herbarium, collected thousands of plant specimens and commissioned local artists to draw beautiful botanical watercolours. His work has thus been influential in South Asian Natural History research.\r\n\r\nThis conference will explore the challenges associated with exploiting such collections and the interesting opportunities they provide for interdisciplinary research. In particular, the conference will consider the experience of the recent “Wallich and Indian Natural History” project as an interesting exemplar (a collaboration with the British Library and The Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew and funded by the World Collections Programme).\r\n\r\nMajor South Asian natural history collections from the 18th and 19th century are now dispersed across institutions in South Asia, Europe and beyond. Thus, the conference will be hosted by the Natural History Museum, London and the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew in partnership with the British Library. This conference plays an integral part in the World Collections Programme’s funded project “Wallich and Indian Natural History”. A full programme and travel information will be available on the Centre for Arts and Humanities (Natural History Museum) website, www.nhm.ac.uk/cahr, by the 30th September, 2011.\r\n\r\nThe definition of ‘South Asia’, in this call for papers, refers to the wide geographical region, as opposed to the Indian subcontinent alone. \r\n\r\nDay One, 6th December\r\n\r\nThe first day of the conference will be held at the Natural History Museum, and structured by three speaker sessions.

Viewers say that Coexist masterfully captures the nuance and complexity of the process of dehumanization and rehumanization that takes place during genocide and in its aftermath.\r\n\r\nAdam Mazo and his colleague, Coexist Learning Director Dr. Mishy Lesser, have worked with hundreds of young people in schools and youth groups using the movie and companion Viewer's Guide to challenge students to reflect deeply on their core beliefs and vital issues: bullying, scapegoating, name-calling, and \"othering\". The Coexist team engages students in activities and dialogue about these pressing issues, which directly impact the ability of youth to succeed and thrive. The filmmakers' goal is for Coexist to be used as a tool to foster understanding about how violence escalates, how it can be interrupted, and the potential each of us has to be victim, perpetrator, bystander, and upstander.\r\n\r\nAdam Mazo is the Executive Producer and Director for Coexist. He has spent time in Rwanda researching and shooting around the country investigating the country's reconciliation efforts. The work included short-form documentary pieces on issues in Rwanda as well as Uganda including: the war in northern Uganda, and education of displaced children. For the last decade he has worked as a journalist in the television news business. He has traveled through more than 20 countries throughout North America, Europe, Africa and the Middle East. He was also trained at the University of Florida where he earned a B.S. in television production. He lives in Boston.\r\n\r\nDavid Russell is Director of Survivors Fund (SURF), a UK-based international organisation which represents and supports survivors of the Rwandan genocide to rebuild their lives in Rwanda and the UK. SURF is guided by a bottom-up approach to support the needs of survivors, as determined by survivors themselves. Programmes range from healthcare to house-building, education to entrepreneurship, and are delivered by local survivors' organisations including AVEGA, AERG and IBUKA with funding from primarily institutional donors (Comic Relief, Charities Advisory Trust, Sigrid Rausing Trust).  David succeeded SURF's Founder Mary Kayitesi Blewitt OBE as Director, with whom he had worked as consultant since 2004. Mary founded the organisation immediately after the genocide, in which she lost over 50 members of her family, and continues to serve as our advocate and ambassador.

Overnight superstars have been made of Cheryl Cole, Susan Boyle and Leona Lewis, while ‘nasty’ judges Simon Cowell and Piers Morgan have been lauded by some for bringing an element of frank criticism, professional expertise and judgement back to popular culture. Yet even as light entertainment shows, they are not without controversy, criticised for everything from being modern-day freak shows to killing creativity and originality by turning popular music into karaoke. Last Christmas an internet campaign saw Rage Against The Machine beat X-Factor winner Joe McElderry to the Number One spot, consumers sending the message to Simon Cowell, that, ‘I won’t do what you tell me’. \r\n\r\nYet the apparent success of ‘pop-opera’ singers such as Paul Potts, G4 and Rhydian on such shows suggests a popular appetite for more serious forms of singing, which the arts world could perhaps exploit. West End musicals have already started to recruit (and create) stars through How Do You Solve A Problem Like Maria? and Over the Rainbow. This year, BBC Radio 2 launched its own ‘Opera X-Factor’ in the shape of the Kiri Prize, and ITV offered talent show alumni and pop musicians the chance to go From Popstar to Operastar. Young musicians point out that classically-trained Myleene Klass was able to use her Popstars fame to become a public arts ambassador, whilst the likes of Katherine Jenkins and Rolando Villazón have used such formats to reach an audience far beyond the rarefied confines of the opera house. But Dame Kiri Te Kanawa herself has raged against the ‘whizz-bang’ of such popular crossover artists, contrasting their instant success to the years of discipline and training required to become a great artist with stamina and longevity.\r\n\r\nDo such shows offer the opportunity to tap a gold mine of talent excluded from elitist cultural institutions, or do they reduce serious singers to the same level as dancing dogs and warbling bin men? Is the popular success of serious performers an important way for niche artforms to reach a wider modern audience, or are they simply trading artistic credibility and value for the trappings of celebrity? Are there other routes available, such as imitating the online media success of pop acts like the Arctic Monkeys and Lily Allen, or are these equally problematic? What makes a truly great performer, and who can be expected to judge?", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 1429, "added": "2010-09-02T12:52:50", "slug": "bfb3eddd7b6084af", "speakers": [{"id": 10134, "name": "Sarah Boyes", "slug": "sarah-boyes"}, {"id": 10135, "name": "Mark Frith", "slug": "mark-frith"}, {"id": 5848, "name": "Barb Jungr", "slug": "barb-jungr"}, {"id": 6605, "name": "Norman Lebrecht", "slug": "norman-lebrecht"}, {"id": 10136, "name": "Michael Rosewell", "slug": "michael-rosewell"}, {"id": 10137, "name": "Peter Whittle", "slug": "peter-whittle"}, {"id": 7443, "name": "David Bowden", "slug": "david-bowden"}], "topics": [{"id": 1869, "name": "performance", "path": "/arts/film/videoart/performance"}, {"id": 197, "name": "performance", "path": "/arts/finearts/performance"}, {"id": 1801, "name": "music", "path": "/business/entertainment/music"}, {"id": 1870, "name": "music", "path": "/science/astronomy/music"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 2326, "name": " Royal College of Music", "slug": "royal-college-of-music", "city": "London", "postcode": "SW7 2BS"}, "organizer": {"id": 45, "name": "Institute of Ideas", "slug": "institute-of-ideas"}, "date": "2010-10-14", "dates": [{"id": 9117, "from_date": "2010-10-14", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "19:00:00", "ticket_cost": "£7.50 (£5 concessions)", "ticket_info": "http://www.instituteofideas.com/tickets/index.html", "additional_info": "http://www.battleofideas.org.uk/index.php/2010/session_detail/4370/", "members_only": "No", "members_info": "Join Institute of Ideas. www.instituteofideas.com", "venue": {"id": 2326, "name": " Royal College of Music", "slug": "royal-college-of-music", "city": "London", "postcode": "SW7 2BS"}, "organizer": {"id": 45, "name": "Institute of Ideas", "slug": "institute-of-ideas"}}]}, {"id": 8336, "title": "What John Dee Did When He Wasn't Chatting with Angels", "synopsis": "Tonight we learn what he was doing when he wasn't summoning angels in his sitting room rounding out our appreciation of Dee.", "keywords": "enochian, occult, pagan, angels, elizabethan, john dee", "body": "John Dee is famed amongs occultists for his angelic workings (his 'spiritual magic') -- the originator of Enochian magic that has permeated the Golden Dawn, the OTO, the A.A. and even chaos magic.

Unusually, the artists in 15mm are differently-disabled, coming to focus on shared experiences of social exclusion under the philosophical banner of access rather than impairment-identity. They believe that much of the social pressure that goes by the name of ‘disability politics’ is ineffectually sanctioned – absorbed ‘top down’ by institutions running a tick box regime, rather than through grass-roots activism. \r\n\r\n15mm Films follows the social model of disability and the main barrier to social inclusion, the one that we target, is the normative world’s perception and prejudices about us… We make irreverent, anarchic comedies representative of ‘crip humour’ in general, while also being willing to formally experiment; a factor that marks us out as maverick misfits in relation to the disability arts community itself.  Aaron Williamson, Artistic Director, 15mm Films.\r\n \r\nTheir most recent project, The Way Out, is currently exhibiting at Beaconsfield and addresses the fact that disability has never had its revolutionary moment - no Suffrage, Stonewall or Watts Riots.  This new artwork comprises a series of trailers for a sequence of films that weren’t made, about a revolution that never happened. The movie is a hole at the centre of the parody – the missing film about an absent revolution, an entity become myth – identifiable with the frustrations and invisibility of disability politics per se.\r\n\r\nCurrent members of the collective are Aaron Williamson (Artistic Director), Katherine Araniello (Editor), Laurence Harvey, Simon Raven, Juliet Robson and Philip Ryder. \r\n \r\nThe Art & Compromise series, delivered in partnership with City & Guilds of London Art School, addresses the various forms and occasions when compromise might enter into art-practice and the criteria that might be used to condemn or commend their effect – is there any form of moral obligation still within art’s purpose?

They cover an ever expanding spectrum of topics. A few of the more unlikely applications are justifying intertribal warfare, the benefits of cannibalism, how the leopard gets its spots, how sex determination in crocodiles has let them survive and demonstrating the connection between badgers and bovine tuberculosis. This lecture shall describe the modelling of two applications.\r\n\r\nThe prognosis for patients with high grade brain tumours is grim and the various treatment protocols such as surgery, radiation and chemotherapy cannot effect a cure. A simple model using patient data and brain scans quantifies the spatio-temporal growth of brain tumours. Analysis of the model shows how difficult it is to decide on the tumour volume to be treated and shows why such treatments have so little success.

When these illnesses occurred, the exorcist/ conjurer would speak of witchcraft attack: a counter-intuitive, out-of-the-ordinary (yet culturally accepted) diagnosis.

The question seems utterly cynical. But, as David Runciman suggests, it is actually much more cynical to pretend that politics can ever be completely sincere. The most dangerous form of political hypocrisy is to claim to have a politics without hypocrisy. \r\n \r\nIn his new book Political Hypocrisy, David Runciman considers problems of sincerity and truth in politics, and how we can deal with them without slipping into hypocrisy ourselves. Runciman tackles the problems through lessons drawn from some of the great truth-tellers in modern political thought - Hobbes, Mandeville, Jefferson, Bentham, Sidgwick, and Orwell - and applies his ideas to different kinds of hypocritical politicians from Oliver Cromwell to Hillary Clinton.\r\n \r\nRunciman argues that we should accept hypocrisy as a fact of politics, but without resigning ourselves to it, let alone cynically embracing it. We should stop trying to eliminate every form of hypocrisy, and we should stop vainly searching for ideally authentic politicians. Instead, we should try to distinguish between harmless and harmful hypocrisies and should worry only about its most damaging varieties.\r\n \r\nJoin David Runciman at the RSA to consider some basic questions about politics: What are the limits of truthfulness in politics?

Soros, whose breadth of experience in financial markets is unrivalled, places the current crisis in the context of decades of study of how individuals and institutions handle the boom and bust cycles that now dominate global economic activity. “This is a once in lifetime moment”, says Soros in characterising the scale of financial distress spreading across Wall Street, the London Stock Exchange, and financial centres around the world. \r\n\r\nGeorge Soros is Chairman of Soros Fund Management, LLC. He was born in Budapest in 1930. He survived the Nazi occupation and fled communist Hungary in 1947 for England, where he graduated from the London School of Economics and Political Science. He then settled in the United States, where he accumulated a large fortune through an international investment fund he founded and managed. Mr Soros has been active as a philanthropist since 1979, when he began providing funds to help black students attend Capetown University in apartheid South Africa. He has established a network of philanthropic organisations active in more than 50 countries around the world. These organisations are dedicated to promoting the values of democracy and an open society. The foundation network spends about $400 million annually. Mr Soros is the author of ten books. His articles and essays on politics, society, and economics regularly appear in major newspapers and magazines around the world. \r\n\r\nHoward Davies is Director of the London School of Economics and Political Science. Prior to his current appointment he was Chairman of the Financial Services Authority, the UK's single financial regulator since 1998. Howard Davies had previously served for two years as Deputy Governor of the Bank of England after three years as Director General of the Confederation of British Industry. From 1987 to 1992 he was Controller of the Audit Commission. From 1982 to 1987 he worked for McKinsey & Company in London and during 1985-1986 was seconded to the Treasury as Special Adviser to the Chancellor of the Exchequer. He had previously worked at the Treasury and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, including two years as Private Secretary to the British Ambassador in Paris.

Based at London’s Centre for the Study of Democracy (CSD), the Democracy Club will be a loose local grouping of staff and students and friends and associates from other institutions, mainly drawn from the London area, who have an interest in the subject of democracy and meet regularly, minimally on a monthly basis, to share and compare their views. The Democracy Club will normally meet in the evenings, with tea and coffee and drinks provided. It will have various overlapping aims : to encourage local participation among CSD staff and students and visiting researchers in discussions about democracy, considered as a language, a way of life and a set of institutions; to provide intellectual and moral and strategic support for the second phase of CSD's Islam and Democracy research programme; and to invite distinguished outside speakers, from home and abroad, to share their views with the Club’s participants. The Democracy Club will also aim to explore contacts with policy makers and practitioners of democratic politics and to encourage awareness of the strategic difficulties of building and preserving democratic institutions; to strengthen CSD’s ties with other research and policy making bodies elsewhere in Europe and the wider world; to focus attention at CSD on the need to seek new sources of research funding in this area; and to provide support for the annual Democracy Lecture to be hosted at CSD from the spring of 2005. The Democracy Club will initially have few ground rules : it will be informal and self-organising and aside from a convenor and rotating chairs of meetings it will not have a permanent organizational structure. It will strive overall to be an open space for differently-minded people – a non-partisan association of scholars and others who do not make presumptions about what democracy is or can be, but instead are bound together by a strong sense that democracy matters, that it is a fragile and precious way of life, and that its fate is now, for the first time in its history, surrounded by uncertainty on a global level.\r\n\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 120, "image_id": 297, "added": "2005-02-16T11:12:52", "slug": "whats-so-good-about-democracy-the-need-for-fresh-thinking-about-an-old-ideal", "speakers": [{"id": 2033, "name": "Professor John Keane", "slug": "professor-john-keane"}], "topics": [{"id": 396, "name": "ethics", "path": "/politics/history/ethics"}, {"id": 349, "name": "history", "path": "/academic/history"}, {"id": 369, "name": "politics", "path": "/society/politics"}, {"id": 389, "name": "politics", "path": "/arts/politics"}, {"id": 332, "name": "philosophy", "path": "/academic/philosophy"}, {"id": 93, "name": "sociology", "path": "/academic/sociology"}], "supercategory": "politics", "venue": {"id": 513, "name": "Centre for the Study of Democracy", "slug": "centre-for-the-study-of-democracy", "city": "London", "postcode": "W1T 3UW"}, "organizer": {"id": 513, "name": "Centre for the Study of Democracy", "slug": "centre-for-the-study-of-democracy"}, "date": "2005-03-01", "dates": [{"id": 1677, "from_date": "2005-03-01", "to_date": "2005-03-01", "time": "18:00:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": null, "additional_info": "Future speakers at the Democracy Club will include Benjamin Barber, Tom Bentley, Chantal Mouffe and others.

Through a comprehensive schedule of keynote presentations, interactive workshops and creative inputs, the overall objective of the day is to promote good examples of inclusive Arts in Education practice. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe diversity of the six projects selected for the workshop/case studies will provide you with significant material and inspiration to initiate effective arts in education projects in both the workshop and/or the classroom. Issues of motivation, attendance, cross-curricula nurturing and creative access will be addressed and cross referenced to these successful projects. \r\n\r\n\r\nHere are preliminary details of the six workshop/case studies:\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Xodus Club House will be a tour of a holistic multi-disciplinary model of arts education. The goal of this model is to provide structures to enable an individual to chart a course to his or her creative future. Facilitated by Dwayne Grannum, Music Educator, Philadelphia \r\n\r\n\r\nThe Exiled Artists in Schools Programme will look at the form and content of this innovative GYPT/Lyric initiative that twins exiled artists from other cultures with nominated mentors and local teachers to create Arts in Education projects. Facilitated by Stella Barnes, Trainer, GYPT, London assisted by Project members\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Life Quiz will look at a recent participatory project undertaken in a Pupil Referral Unit (PRU) by a teacher and an artist in partnership under the auspices of the LIFT Teacher’s Forum year long training course. Facilitated by Janet Evans, teacher & Thierry Lawson, artist, London \r\n\r\n\r\n'100* Fahrenheit' Mayhem Youth Theatre will present a workshop that reflects the contradiction between the study of Aeschylus's trilogy of plays 'The Oresteia' and the young people's contemporary realisation of the story set in the world of themselves and their parents. Facilitated by the Company\r\n\r\n\r\nPeer Motivators will look at the ideas informing the Tower Hamlet’s Summer University . This radical initiative aims at raising the aspirations and achievements of young people. One way is through this community peer and volunteering scheme. Facilitated by Sarah Davies, Director, THSU, London assisted by peer motivators [tbc] \r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Smith’ s After School Music Club will look at the ideas behind these voluntary music sessions based in an inner city secondary school that have resulted in the creation of a pilot full-time project for disaffected young people inspired by the success of former member Dizzee Rascal. Facilitated by Tim Smith, Music Teacher, London \r\n\r\n\r\nLEAParts is a unique pan-London Arts in Education organisation.  It is funded by Arts Council London to offer a service to all 33 boroughs that make-up greater London.  It brings together artists and educators to develop the theory and practice of Arts in Education as part of a national and international forum.  It is dedicated to developing Arts in Education, building networks, creating partnerships, sharing ideas and facilitating professional development, all within the context of the universal struggle for creativity and culture. \r\n\r\nLEAParts emerged as a practical response to the fragmentation and under-resourcing that afflicted Arts in Education for over a decade at the end of the 20th century.  It believes in actively restoring and increasing opportunities for young people to participate in the arts across all art forms.  Furthermore it believes that the arts are a powerful educational resource that can communicate with people of all ages on a variety of levels embracing the cognitive, affective, physical and spiritual aspects of our being.  \r\n\r\nLEAParts aims to keep abreast of, and then respond to, changes to Arts in Education locally, nationally and internationally.  As such it welcomes informed comment and input on its current policy and activities.  Its website www.leaparts.info is designed to provide a meaningful and enjoyable forum where this professional dialogue can be shared.
