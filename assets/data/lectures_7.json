Many of the studies mentioned above touch on reasons why parents decide not to vaccinate.\r\n\r\nIn order to even begin to understand this language, ethnographic research skills are necessary as vaccination narratives are presented and communicated in a variety of ways through the use of traditional narratives and beliefs. The most common genres used in vaccination discourse are contemporary legends, rumour, and personal experience narratives, or in some cases, a combination of the three.\r\n\r\nThis presentation explores vernacular beliefs and practices that surround decisions to not vaccinate with the primary aim of providing concrete recommendations for improving inoculation promotion programs. Understanding health choices is dependent on exploring the variety of cultural concerns and influences that constitute risk for the communities and individuals in question.

Join the London Fortean Society in London’s dark heart for a day of modern monsters and urban myth.\r\n\r\nOur cityscapes are full of strange wonders, terrors and tales. Come hear of them.\r\n\r\nMike Dash – Spring-heeled Jack\r\n\r\nEver since his earliest appearances in 1837, Spring-heeled Jack – a demonic bogey who breathed fire at his victims, tore at their clothes with iron claws, and leaped over hedgerows and houses to evade pursuit – has been one of the strangest and most unsettling mystery attackers in the Fortean and folkloric canon. Mike Dash has been researching the case since 1983, and presents an overview of the evidence that sets Jack in his contemporary contexts, explores his antecedents, and asks whether he is really as unique a figure as he seems to be.\r\n\r\nDr Mike Dash is an historian and long-time member of Fortean Times’s legendary Gang of Fort. Educated at Cambridge and King’s College London, he is the author of seven books, including Borderlands, an overview of strange phenomena reviewed by New Scientist as “exhaustive, erudite and superb.” He now runs a company devoted to improving critical thinking in schools and universities.\r\n\r\nAndrea Kitta – Slender Man\r\n\r\nThe Slender Man is a contemporary monster that has stepped out from the digital world and out in to the physical. Dr Andrea Kitta discusses the beginnings of Slenderman on the Something Awful forum and other venues for creepypasta, there is a shared aesthetic and, at times, a shared experience that taps into something deeper than mere play. Just as Slender Man himself is complicated, so is belief in Slender Man.\r\n\r\nSlender Man is not a simple entity that can be looked at as belonging to a single folk group. He is, possibly, an acknowledgement of the unacknowledged common experience of being watched. The reason why he “feels real” to so many people is because he helps to give a voice to a real experience that is difficult to understand otherwise. Like legends, which are not literally true but rather “typify life in modern society” (Smith 1999), Slender Man also is a part of the experience of life in the modern world.\r\n\r\nAndrea Kitta is a folklorist with a specialty in medicine, belief, and the supernatural. She is also interested in Internet folklore, narrative, and contemporary (urban) legend.

The talk will concentrate principally on some of the stories of the capital’s ancient ‘secret’ passages and tunnels and sightings of ghosts underground.\r\n\r\nDr David Clarke – Tears for Fears: The Curse of the Crying Boy\r\n\r\nThe Crying Boy (TCB) is a mass produced sentimental print and an example of ‘folk art’ that was popular from the 1970s in working glass families in the UK. It exists in many forms. In 1985 a British tabloid newspaper The Sun published a series of hyperbolic stories reporting the existence of a jinx attached to this hideously tasteless, yet popular print. The source of the stories was attributed fire fighters who had noted the frequent occurrence of the print at domestic property fires in one English community. The intervention of journalists added a supernatural element to the story and created a proto-legend. This talk examines how TCB acquired a narrative and was transformed as it migrated from print to online media.\r\n\r\nDavid teaches Media Law, regulation and ethics on the undergraduate and postgraduate journalism courses at Sheffield Hallam. As Principal Research Fellow he leads on integrating teaching and research in the Journalism Subject Group. His publications and wide experience as a broadcaster and consultant/curator for The National Archives UFO project has brought international recognition to the University as a centre of expertise in the study of contemporary legends.\r\n\r\nTina Rath – The Hackney Bear\r\n\r\n“We were near the football pitches at about five o’clock in the evening when we saw it,” said Darren Willoughby, aged 12, “It was very close to us, standing on its hind legs and about seven feet tall.”\r\n\r\nOn 27 December1981 four boys from Lower Clapton took their dogs out for a walk across Hackney Marshes. Past Millfields Road, near the football pitches, the boys encountered “a giant great growling hairy thing”. They met a bear in Hackney.\r\n\r\nTina Rath hunts the story of the Hackney Bear, the police hunt for it and how is returned in 2012 and why a Brit Pop bands may have been involved.\r\n\r\nTina Rath gained her doctorate from London University with a thesis on The Vampire in Popular Fiction and her MA with a dissertation on The Vampire in the Theatre.\r\n\r\nScott Wood – The Hidden Insult\r\n\r\nDid you hear about the insult hidden in the jacket of a prince or inside the car of a queen?

This, says, Socrates is why we must learn how to choose the right kind of life both here and in the next world – a good life being that which leads us to being just, and a bad life being one that commits us to injustice.

Along the various routes that make up the network of the ‘Silk Road’ - itself a misnomer - flourished an exotic mixture of cultures from Arabic, Turkic, Iranian, Indian, Mongolian, Chinese and Tibetan sources.\r\n\r\nThe richness of cultures is evident in spectacular sites ranging from abandoned cities and fortresses, Buddhist cave sites and Islamic mausoleums along the many trade routes that made the Silk Road network. The Taklamakan and Gobi desert regions yielded many artistic treasures to 19th and 20th century European archaeologists who explored - and plundered - many sites for their uniquely preserved artefacts. The research that came from these items revealed much more understanding about the relevance and significance of the Silk Road and its place in the economic history of the region.\r\n\r\nThe legacy of the Silk Road lives on through the artefacts, writings, maps and contribution of the many travellers throughout the region over many centuries. However, this legacy may soon be found only in museums and collections, as the rapidly changing landscape of modern technology changes the face of this region.\r\n\r\nThe course aims to understand how and why the Silk Road trade network came into being and to explore reasons for the success and demise of its cities and traders in certain areas and eras. It will look at the diverse cultures that practiced different religions and produced exotic items that were traded freely along the routes, and what became of them in later years. It will also analyse how the present era of modernisation is changing the face of the Silk Road; the environmental impact of technological advances in the western regions of China and how they are affecting significant archaeological sites.\r\n\r\nThis session will be a visit to the British Museum Joseph E Hotung Gallery\r\n\r\n ", "additional_info": null, "duration": 300, "image_id": null, "added": "2015-04-25T10:48:01", "slug": "d7eb34e94a01bccf", "speakers": [{"id": 13641, "name": "Ms Suzanne Perrin", "slug": "ms-suzanne-perrin"}], "topics": [{"id": 131, "name": "authors", "path": "/arts/literature/fiction/british/21stcentury/authors"}, {"id": 130, "name": "21stcentury", "path": "/arts/literature/fiction/british/21stcentury"}, {"id": 106, "name": "wwi", "path": "/arts/books/history/military/wwi"}, {"id": 107, "name": "wwii", "path": "/arts/books/history/military/wwii"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 2725, "name": "The University Women's Club", "slug": "the-university-womens-club", "city": "London", "postcode": "W1K 1DB"}, "organizer": {"id": 2290, "name": "THE COURSE", "slug": "the-course"}, "date": "2016-03-17", "dates": [{"id": 15180, "from_date": "2016-03-17", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "10:45:00", "ticket_cost": "£49", "ticket_info": "info@thecoursestudies.co.uk", "additional_info": "visit www.thecoursestudies.co.uk", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 2725, "name": "The University Women's Club", "slug": "the-university-womens-club", "city": "London", "postcode": "W1K 1DB"}, "organizer": {"id": 2290, "name": "THE COURSE", "slug": "the-course"}}]}, {"id": 14387, "title": "Bring Back Capital Punishment?", "synopsis": "This will be a lively but serious discussion event to kick-off 2015, exploring whether there is now a case to re-introduce the death sentence in the UK.", "keywords": "capital punishment, crime, law, humanism", "body": "Barbara Smoker, who is adamantly opposed to such a notion, will explain why this “barbaric\" practice - outlawed across the European Union, was abandoned as a form of retribution in the UK in 1963.

Members generally continue to hold this view to this day.\r\nEvan Parker will set out why we should now reconsider our thinking on this very emotive issue. He will present arguments as to why inconsistent, outdated and non-democratic thought processes have prevailed in determining the ultimate sanction, and that it is timely to revisit. He will describe how capital punishment could now be viewed as appropriate retribution, bringing potential benefits to our society and interpreted as an ethical practice.\r\nEvan Parker held the Chair in Semiconductor Physics for 25 years at the University of Warwick. He continues to do research in nanotechnology and has strong interests in climate change, including geo-engineering. He has published widely, spun-out several companies including one in 2014.

She served in the Women’s Royal Naval Service from 1942-45, mainly in south-east Asia. In 1949 she became an atheist. In 1951 she joined the South Place Ethical Society, in the course of time taking on all the major roles in the Society, becoming in1986 the Society’s only female Appointed Lecturer.\r\n \r\nShe was elected President of the National Secular Society in 1971 until 1996, representing the atheist viewpoint in print, on lecture platforms, speaking tours and on radio and television.  A forceful debater, she was active in many social campaigns including  abolition of the death penalty, prison reform, CND, the legalisation of abortion and for voluntary euthanasia. \r\n \r\nBarbara was an early officiant at non-religious funerals, wedding ceremonies, and gay and lesbian commitments. In 2005, she received the Distinguished Service Award from the International Humanist and Ethical Union.

What should the UK be making in the 21st century?", "keywords": "Economy, Manufacturing, Investment, Future", "body": "Reflecting on ‘the Facebook movie’, The Social Network, Zadie Smith observed that while critics have spent the last decade bemoaning the lack of outstanding generation-defining art, it ‘turns out the brightest 2.0 kids have been doing something else extraordinary. They’ve been making a world’. In 2008, the Digital Britain report seemed to confirm the future for British industry was creative, a trend continued by David Cameron’s stated ambition to build an East London rival to Silicon Valley. From the ‘app economy’ to DIY fashion, every area of popular culture is seen as ripe for ‘crowdsourcing’ the individual creativity of many, with user-generated content constantly shifting the boundaries of traditional design and production. Even those turn-of-millennium titans of mass-produced branding – McDonald’s and Starbucks – have started to experiment with ‘stealth’ stores which emphasise uniqueness rather than uniformity.\r\n\r\nDespite this, however, it comes as something of a surprise for many to discover UK manufacturing is still the sixth largest in the world, albeit with an international reputation for pharmaceuticals and aerospace rather than cars and consumer goods. Yet there is constant unease about Britain’s ability to remain competitive in a globalised world: Generation 2.0 may come equipped with high-end programming skills and MBAs, but when it comes to the ‘hands on’ skills, British employers regularly have to look abroad for a Polish plumber, German engineer or Chinese mathematician. Moreover, as ‘real’ production becomes increasingly outsourced to the developing world, there is growing unease about high street shops’ complicity with child labour overseas. On top of ethical concerns come aesthetic ones, with many looking down on the mass production of cheap goods. Hand-sewn clothes by home-grown designers seem doubly preferable to clothes made with faceless machinery and sweated labour.\r\n\r\nIs this move towards the ‘creative economy’ simply the latest evolution of Adam Smith’s division of labour, or is there a serious risk of overspecialisation once the Chinese et al develop their designers alongside their factories? Should we embrace a return to the days of thrifty ‘make do and mend’ or celebrate mass production’s achievements in creating mountains of ‘stuff’?

How important was the sudden extinction of dinosaurs in the rise of mammals?  How have they responded to climate change in the past?  Why have some groups, such as rodents, radiated so much more than others?  Why are Africa's native mammals so much more spectacular and more diverse – but also more threatened – than our own?

Most importantly, promoting invertebrate and ecosystem conservation without the need to focus on charismatic megafauna requires us to build more capacity in the field and raise the profile of non-vertebrate biodiversity with the general public.\r\n\r\nAfter all, without the foundations of biodiversity, life on Earth as we know it would be impossible.\r\n\r\n_Organised by Jonathan Baillie (ZSL), Ben Collen (ZSL), Michael Samways (Stellenbosch University) and Monika Böhm (ZSL)_\r\n\r\n\r\nREGISTRATION WILL OPEN SOON\r\n\r\nFor further details or to register your interest, please see www.zsl.org/science/scientific-meetings/ or contact Joy Hayward, Scientific Meetings Coordinator, Zoological Society of London, Regent's Park, London NW1 4RY; tel: +44 (0)20 7449 6227; fax: +44 (0)20 7449 6411; e-mail: joy.hayward@zsl.org.", "additional_info": null, "duration": 480, "image_id": 1028, "added": "2009-09-13T07:40:16", "slug": "fd5220962a493607", "speakers": [{"id": 8684, "name": "Please see link for full details", "slug": "please-see-link-for-full-details"}], "topics": [{"id": 676, "name": "naturalhistory", "path": "/academic/naturalhistory"}, {"id": 1267, "name": "naturalhistory", "path": "/academic/science/naturalhistory"}, {"id": 215, "name": "entomology", "path": "/science/biology/entomology"}, {"id": 159, "name": "biodiversity", "path": "/science/biology/biodiversity"}, {"id": 217, "name": "botany", "path": "/science/biology/botany"}, {"id": 679, "name": "naturalhistory", "path": "/science/biology/naturalhistory"}, {"id": 1105, "name": "ecology", "path": "/science/ecology"}, {"id": 1534, "name": "conservation", "path": "/science/conservation"}, {"id": 467, "name": "zoology", "path": "/science/zoology"}, {"id": 468, "name": "naturalhistory", "path": "/science/naturalhistory"}, {"id": 1115, "name": "wildlife", "path": "/science/environment/wildlife"}, {"id": 802, "name": "climatechange", "path": "/science/environment/climatechange"}], "supercategory": "academic", "venue": {"id": 685, "name": "The Zoological Society of London", "slug": "the-zoological-society-of-london", "city": "London", "postcode": "NW1 4RY"}, "organizer": {"id": 685, "name": "The Zoological Society of London", "slug": "the-zoological-society-of-london"}, "date": "2010-02-25", "dates": [{"id": 7402, "from_date": "2010-02-25", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "9:00:00", "ticket_cost": "£TBC for both days; £TBC per day. 50% discount for students and ZSL members.", "ticket_info": "This is a two-day symposium to be held on Thursday 25 and Friday 26 February 2010.

Using text mining tools the researcher can extract specific information, find unpredicted relationships or deviations from usual patterns, find gaps, and generally explore the data. The outcome is the creation, validation, or rejection of novel interpretations of literary texts. There is a constantly growing amount of textual material available for literary researchers in forms of digital archives, libraries, collections. Within the community of literary scholars dealing with these kind of resources there is a growing interest in applications able to support complex tasks, which go far beyond merely accessing, searching, and retrieving relevant documents from the collections.\"", "additional_info": null, "duration": null, "image_id": null, "added": "2008-08-26T05:03:56", "slug": "f0abb265d20e9a53", "speakers": [{"id": 7130, "name": "Stefanie Posavec", "slug": "stefanie-posavec"}, {"id": 7131, "name": "Piotr Michura", "slug": "piotr-michura"}], "topics": [{"id": 131, "name": "authors", "path": "/arts/literature/fiction/british/21stcentury/authors"}, {"id": 130, "name": "21stcentury", "path": "/arts/literature/fiction/british/21stcentury"}, {"id": 1333, "name": "linguistics", "path": "/academic/arts/linguistics/linguistics"}, {"id": 1335, "name": "design", "path": "/arts/design/graphicdesign/design"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 1733, "name": "The Brand Union", "slug": "the-brand-union", "city": "London", "postcode": "EC1M 4AA"}, "organizer": {"id": 1683, "name": "The Information Design Association", "slug": "the-information-design-association"}, "date": "2008-09-16", "dates": [{"id": 5946, "from_date": "2008-09-16", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "18:30:00", "ticket_cost": "£5", "ticket_info": "http://ida.eventwax.com/text-visualisation-two-approaches", "additional_info": "IDA on Twitter: http://twitter.com/InfodesignUK", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 1733, "name": "The Brand Union", "slug": "the-brand-union", "city": "London", "postcode": "EC1M 4AA"}, "organizer": {"id": 1683, "name": "The Information Design Association", "slug": "the-information-design-association"}}]}, {"id": 5623, "title": "Depicting movement: patterns in the brain", "synopsis": "This event will look at different types of movement disorders and how researchers are trying to model human movement.", "keywords": "brain, biology, body, medicine, health", "body": "This event will look at different types of movement disorders and how researchers are trying to model human movement in order to gain a better understanding of neural patterns, and through that develop better tools for rehabilitation.\r\n\r\nThis event takes place at the Royal Institution and tickets cost £8 standard, £6 concessions, £4 RI Members.

The final talk looks at how much pragmatism, as a philosophical movement, constitutes a self-conscious break with the 'authority' of the European tradition.

From multi-billion dollar investments in oil and minerals to the influx of thousands of merchants, labourers and cheap consumer goods, China's economic and political reach is redefining Africa's traditional ties with the international community. In this talk Dr Chris Alden will cover the emerging relationship between China and Africa to determine whether this engagement will be that of a development partner, economic competitor or new hegemon. Alden argues that in order to understand Chinese involvement on the continent, we need to recognize the range of economic, diplomatic and security rationales behind Beijing's Africa policy as well as the response of African elites to China's entreaties.
