Almina was Chatelaine of Highclere Castle ( the back drop to TV’s Downton Abbey)  from 1895 until 1923. \r\n\r\nAlmina made a major contribution to nursing the wounded in the Great War and ran a series of plush nursing homes in London and surrounds from 1914-1943.  Here she pampered the rich, famous and many Royals.\r\n\r\nAlmina spent a King’s Ransom: principally the legacies from her mother, Marie Boyer, who died in 1913, and from her godfather-guardian, Baron Alfred de Rothschild, who died in 1918. Almina also received the proceeds of the 5th Earl’s Will.  Almina was made bankrupt in 1951 and died in Bristol on 8 May 1969, aged 93.\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 120, "image_id": 1953, "added": "2015-03-09T13:26:33", "slug": "220c3616651bd35f", "speakers": [{"id": 13766, "name": "Mr William  Cross", "slug": "mr-william-cross"}], "topics": [{"id": 3272, "name": "life", "path": "/arts/literature/writing/life"}, {"id": 1840, "name": "life", "path": "/arts/philosophy/life"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 3162, "name": "Gwent Osteoporosis Group", "slug": "gwent-osteoporosis-group", "city": "Llanover", "postcode": "NP7 9HB"}, "organizer": {"id": 2861, "name": "William Cross, FSA Scot", "slug": "william-cross-fsa-scot"}, "date": "2015-04-01", "dates": [{"id": 15071, "from_date": "2015-04-01", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "19:00:00", "ticket_cost": "Contact Gwent Osteoporosis Group\t", "ticket_info": "Contact Gwent Osteoporosis Group\t", "additional_info": "William Cross, FSA Scot is the author of FIVE Books on the Herbert family ( Earls and Countesses of Carnarvon).

It also fulfils the criteria for a much-needed new model that integrates psychotherapy and counselling with the latest findings about brain functioning and human behaviour.\r\n\r\nAn essential day for mental health workers at all levels.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.humangivenscollege.com/courses/stress-to-psychosis.html", "additional_info": null, "duration": 480, "image_id": 1908, "added": "2013-04-24T20:17:36", "slug": "from-stress-to-psychosis-how-to-prevent-people-having-breakdowns", "speakers": [{"id": 13679, "name": "Julian Penton", "slug": "julian-penton"}], "topics": [{"id": 407, "name": "stress", "path": "/society/health/stress"}, {"id": 2036, "name": "psychotherapy", "path": "/science/psychology/psychotherapy"}, {"id": 2163, "name": "therapy", "path": "/arts/finearts/therapy"}, {"id": 372, "name": "psychology", "path": "/academic/philosophy/psychology"}], "supercategory": "society", "venue": {"id": 941, "name": "Friends Meeting House", "slug": "friends-meeting-house", "city": "London", "postcode": "NW1 2BJ"}, "organizer": {"id": 2602, "name": "Human Givens College", "slug": "human-givens-college"}, "date": "2013-05-15", "dates": [{"id": 12932, "from_date": "2013-05-15", "to_date": "2013-05-15", "time": "9:30:00", "ticket_cost": "£192", "ticket_info": "Human Givens College\r\nwww.humangivenscollege.com\r\n01323 811690", "additional_info": "http://www.humangivenscollege.com/courses/stress-to-psychosis.html", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 941, "name": "Friends Meeting House", "slug": "friends-meeting-house", "city": "London", "postcode": "NW1 2BJ"}, "organizer": {"id": 2602, "name": "Human Givens College", "slug": "human-givens-college"}}]}, {"id": 12449, "title": "Human givens foundation course 2: Effective brief psychotherapy", "synopsis": "Discover how to make a positive difference, whatever the problem, using the key concepts and the essential skills of human givens therapy.", "keywords": "psychotherapy, brief psychotherapy, depression, anxiety, stress, wellbeing, PTSD, trauma, addiction", "body": "Course outline:\r\nDiscover how to make a positive difference, whatever the problem, using the key concepts and the essential skills of human givens therapy.\r\n\r\nJulian Penton's lively training day distills the essence of the more successful therapy models, including cognitive behavourial therapy (CBT), solution-focussed brief ttherapy (SFBT) and interpersonal therapy, by working through the APET model.\r\n\r\nAnyone working in the caring professions can safely introduce these strategies into their work with patients or clients.

In this lecture Dr Lynn McDonald will explain the differences between these two women and their contributions, Nightingale as nurse, public health and hospital reformer, and Seacole as doctress, businesswoman, voluntary first aid worker and author. McDonald will argue that Seacole deserves to be honoured, but should be for her own significant achievements, and not Nightingale’s. The campaign for a 3-metre high bronze statue of Seacole, at Nightingale’s hospital, St Thomas’, will be examined in the light of what Seacole herself claimed for her contribution, and her own description of her relationship with Nightingale, in her memoir, Wonderful Adventures of Mrs Seacole in Many Lands.\r\n\r\nDr Lynn McDonald is the director of The Collected Works of Florence Nightingale, a former member of Canada’s Parliament, and former president of Canada’s largest women’s organization. \r\n\r\nThe lecture will be followed by a free glass of wine and an opportunity to view the museum.

Accordingly, these areas can be termed ‘mono-cultural’, ‘mono-faith’ communities. This is particularly true for significant numbers of Muslims in many towns and cities of the UK. I give the term ‘psychic detachment’ to describe the phenomenon of people (especially religious-ethnic minority communities) leading highly segregated lives with few points of contact with mainstream society.\r\n\r\nRumy Hasan will explore the proposition that self-segregation of Muslims is engendering a heightened religious identity with concomitant high levels of psychic detachment. This, in turn, is contributing to the alienation of, and arousing negative feelings among, many non-Muslims, in particular significant numbers of the majority White society. This has had – is having – political consequences, the most worrying of which is that far right groups are utilising such alienation to their advantage.

It’s a love that is unshakable, unmoving, and indestructible. Such love – a love that transcends yet simultaneously embraces the world – is what compels human beings to evolve, from their own deepest depths, and to become better citizens of our world and our cosmos. Knowing the mysterious source of that love is knowing before thought that life is good.

It begins by considering the reasons why the exceedingly perishable human body can, under certain natural conditions, be preserved almost indefinitely, such as in extremes of coldness or dryness, or where suitable chemicals or anaerobic conditions exist. It will examine specific cases where bodies from bogs, deserts and frozen wastes have turned into immortal versions of their former selves. The second half of the lecture will look at how human ingenuity has been employed over the centuries to produce the same effect for religious or political purposes. In Egypt, a culture that celebrated death on a massive scale, outrageous amounts of time were spent in preserving the bodies of certain individuals. In medieval Europe the bodies of the nobility were specially treated to give them an extended shelf life so they could survive long journeys and the elaborate funerals of the era. Recent history has seen the exhibition of conserved corpses as artistic objects and some governments, perhaps with more sinister agendas, have sought to legitimise their positions by using the ultimate in embalming techniques to turn worshipped national figures into permanent icons. Finally, the question will be asked: are all these conserved corpses just farcical parodies of once sentient and intelligent people or are they meaningful cultural artefacts that can tell us something about the human condition over the centuries and are still capable of imparting useful scientific information now and in the future?", "additional_info": null, "duration": 60, "image_id": null, "added": "2007-06-24T12:49:12", "slug": "14ac56ca687feb23", "speakers": [{"id": 3384, "name": "City of London guide Robert Stephenson", "slug": "city-of-london-guide-robert-stephenson"}], "topics": [{"id": 900, "name": "egypt", "path": "/academic/history/egypt"}, {"id": 253, "name": "medieval", "path": "/arts/historyofart/medieval"}, {"id": 257, "name": "medieval", "path": "/arts/history/medieval"}, {"id": 69, "name": "science", "path": "/science"}, {"id": 1087, "name": "paranormal", "path": "/religion/paranormal"}, {"id": 126, "name": "archaeology", "path": "/science/archaeology"}], "supercategory": "academic", "venue": {"id": 1024, "name": "Brompton Cemetery Chapel", "slug": "brompton-cemetery-chapel", "city": "London", "postcode": "SW10 9UG"}, "organizer": {"id": 754, "name": "Friends of Brompton Cemetery", "slug": "friends-of-brompton-cemetery"}, "date": "2007-08-16", "dates": [{"id": 4650, "from_date": "2007-08-16", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "18:30:00", "ticket_cost": "£5.00", "ticket_info": "Pay on the door", "additional_info": "The nearest Tube is West Brompton on District Line - turn right out of the station.", "members_only": "No", "members_info": "Annual membership of the Friends of Brompton Cemetery is £5.00", "venue": {"id": 1024, "name": "Brompton Cemetery Chapel", "slug": "brompton-cemetery-chapel", "city": "London", "postcode": "SW10 9UG"}, "organizer": {"id": 754, "name": "Friends of Brompton Cemetery", "slug": "friends-of-brompton-cemetery"}}]}, {"id": 4291, "title": "Life Under the Antarctic Ice", "synopsis": "Join us as we discover what life lurks deep in the waters under the Antarctic ice.", "keywords": "science, natural history, museum, london, collection, zoology, antarctica, ice, animal, worm", "body": "Antarctica is a land of ice.

They are particularly interested in your views on genetic screening. \r\nWe want what you say as an audience to be heard, so we will submit participants' ideas and comments from Naked Science: Gene Screen directly  to the Human Genetics Commission. \r\nJoin us on the night to look at the opportunities and threats this genetic knowledge could provide us.\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 129, "added": "2004-08-27T12:32:45", "slug": "f6ddbebbf5732a9d", "speakers": [{"id": 1460, "name": "Professor Elizabeth Anionwu", "slug": "professor-elizabeth-anionwu"}], "topics": [{"id": 170, "name": "newtopic", "path": "/science/chemistry/biochemistry/catalysis/newtopic"}, {"id": 169, "name": "catalysis", "path": "/science/chemistry/biochemistry/catalysis"}, {"id": 157, "name": "chromosomes", "path": "/science/genetics/chromosomes"}, {"id": 431, "name": "science", "path": "/arts/books/science"}], "supercategory": "science", "venue": {"id": 15, "name": "Dana Centre", "slug": "dana-centre", "city": "London", "postcode": "SW7 5HE"}, "organizer": {"id": 46, "name": "Science Museum", "slug": "science-museum"}, "date": "2004-09-08", "dates": [{"id": 1224, "from_date": "2004-09-08", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "19:00:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": "All events are FREE but please pre-book on: 020 7942 4040 or <a href=\"mailto:tickets@danacentre.org.uk\">tickets@danacentre.org.uk</a>", "additional_info": null, "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 15, "name": "Dana Centre", "slug": "dana-centre", "city": "London", "postcode": "SW7 5HE"}, "organizer": {"id": 46, "name": "Science Museum", "slug": "science-museum"}}]}, {"id": 1037, "title": "In the beginning: the Roman, the Viking and the Norman Conquests", "synopsis": "From the _Anglo-American Relations_ lecture series.", "keywords": "Rhetoric", "body": "As an island people, the inhabitants of Britain were repeatedly subject to invasions from the Continent, at least until they had a powerful navy of their own.
