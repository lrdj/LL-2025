The Ednams became a dynamic couple of the Bright Young Things era of the 1920s, but in July, 1930 at the peak of their chaotic life together, Rosemary met her sudden death in a horrific aeroplane crash, which also killed three of her fellow aristocrats.

To encourage listeners to explore further, lectures will conclude with a short recorded operatic extract, and suggested listening lists will be provided for those who wish to explore further at home.\r\n\r\nThey do it differently in France\r\n19th century French opera\r\n\r\nIn the fourth lecture, you will see how the combination of the Revolution and the rise of the middle class lead to the decline of the plot based on mythological subjects and the very distinct tradition of French Grand Opera, centred on the Paris Opera (referred to by Verdi as la grande boutique). Foreign invasions from composers such as Rossini, Meyerbeer, Donizetti and Verdi all led to profitable cross-fertilisation and the development of a strongly native French operatic tradition.

The series aims to offer fresh vantage points on artistic practice and environment, and feed in to current debates around the UK dance ecology.\r\n\r\nFull list of speakers at Crossing Borders 2012:\r\n\r\n20 Nov - Emilyn Claid in conversation with Simon Ellis\r\n27 Nov - Julyen Hamilton and Jacky Lansley\r\n4 Dec - Hester Reeve\r\n11 Dec - Siobhan Davies and David Hinton \r\n\r\nDate: Tuesdays 2 Oct – 11 Dec 2012\r\nTime: 7-8:30pm\t\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 1768, "added": "2012-11-14T18:49:17", "slug": "25d6b1c00a41d927", "speakers": [{"id": 13137, "name": "Emily Claid", "slug": "emily-claid"}], "topics": [{"id": 1018, "name": "talk", "path": "/arts/education/debate/talk"}, {"id": 722, "name": "seminar", "path": "/arts/enterprise/seminar"}, {"id": 2912, "name": "seminar", "path": "/arts/photography/seminar"}, {"id": 2972, "name": "talk", "path": "/arts/books/talk"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 1781, "name": "Independent Dance", "slug": "independent-dance", "city": "London", "postcode": "SE1 6ER"}, "organizer": {"id": 1781, "name": "Independent Dance", "slug": "independent-dance"}, "date": "2012-11-20", "dates": [{"id": 12264, "from_date": "2012-11-20", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "19:00:00", "ticket_cost": "£6 full price / £4 concessions and freelance dance artists", "ticket_info": "Independent Dance: 020 7091 9650 / info@independentdance.co.uk", "additional_info": "For full details of the series please visit: www.independentdance.co.uk", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 1781, "name": "Independent Dance", "slug": "independent-dance", "city": "London", "postcode": "SE1 6ER"}, "organizer": {"id": 1781, "name": "Independent Dance", "slug": "independent-dance"}}]}, {"id": 11780, "title": "The Seven Years War (1756-1763): the first world war", "synopsis": "Dr John McAleer, from the University of Southampton, discusses the first war to take place on a global scale.", "keywords": "Southampton; History; eighteenth century; Seven Years War; ", "body": "The Seven Years War was the first war to take place on a global scale.

I shall argue that the roots of our emotions are often unconscious, and we can be unaware of the influence they have on our vision of living of a good life and the choices we make. To uncover this influence is not itself with the power of reason as traditionally understood; instead, we require a set of interrelated dispostions, viz. acceptance, vulnerability, courage, and compassion.

Now, the government is stepping up efforts to impose stricter financial regulations to ensure that such things do not happen in future. Will more regulation work? If history is any guide, the answer is no. Over the last 100 years, we've had a financial crisis every 15-20 years. Every time one took place, the government would step in and impose more regulation - only for another crisis to occur 15-20 years later. Why is that? Social psychology tells us that human behaviours are conditioned not only by incentives but also by a variety of other factors (such as values, culture, structures, processes and so on). Regulation only influences incentives. What we need to do is go beyond regulation and find ways to influence the other factors that create \"bad\" behaviours (that lead to a crisis). \r\n\r\nCostas Markides is the Robert P.

His acclaimed epic of Indian life, A Suitable Boy (1993), won the WH Smith Literary Award and the Commonwealth Writers Prize (Overall Winner, Best Book). Set in India in the early 1950s, it is the story of a young girl, Lata, and her search for a husband. An Equal Music (1999), is the story of a violinist haunted by the memory of a former lover. Vikram Seth is also the author of a travel book, From Heaven Lake: Travels Through Sinkiang and Tibet (1983), an account of a journey through Tibet, China and Nepal that won the Thomas Cook Travel Book Award, and a libretto, Arion and the Dolphin: A Libretto (1994), which was performed at the English National Opera in June 1994, with music by Alec Roth.

Mark Tucker sings the title role.\r\n\r\nThe Baroque masterpiece tells the moving tale of Orfeo’s journey into the underworld in search of his lost bride Euridice.  Other members of the cast include Joanne Lunn as Las Musica and Proserpina, Julia Gooding as La Messaggiera and Mark Chambers as Speranza.  Sue Lefton is choreographer and Shirin Guild has designed the costumes.\r\n\r\nOriginally commissioned by The South Bank Centre in 2003, New London Consort’s L’Orfeo has been a highlight of recent Queen Elizabeth Hall seasons, and has won international acclaim in Bergen, Beijing and Paris.  This production, which will be semi-staged has been revived to celebrate the 400th anniversary of the piece’s first performance for noble entertainment in Italy in 1607. \r\n\r\nJonathan Miller is one of the world’s leading opera directors, as well as being a celebrated satirist, medical expert and author. His work in the 1970s for Glyndebourne and ENO established his credentials in the world of opera, and he has collaborated closely with Philip Pickett to ensure this performance is as close to its original form as possible.  He will talk about his vision for L’Orfeo, plus his life and work in a pre-concert talk at 6pm.\r\n\r\nConductor Philip Pickett was first inspired by Jonathan Miller’s acclaimed production of L’Orfeo in the 1970s when he was a member of the company orchestra.  He is now an eminent advocate of period performance himself and his versatile New London Consort has an undisputed reputation for artistry, flair and virtuosity.\r\n\r\nTickets for Jonathan Miller’s production of Monterverdi’s L’Orfeo at The Bridgewater Hall, Manchester cost from £12 to £27, and can be booked via Box Office, telephone 0161 907 9000 or website www.bridgewater-hall.co.uk.

His book, Scots and the Union, has caused controversy in this, the 300th anniversary of the act of Union.\r\n\r\nChris Whatley says, \"What's pleasing me is the number of people who are saying that the book has transformed thinking on the Union. For many people, the idea that England 'bought the soul’ of Scotland is now dead in the water. The task for me now is to unpick more thoroughly the reasons why the nationalist interpretation has held true for so long.\"\r\n\r\nIn the book Professor Whatley, of the University of Dundee, examines the Act of Union between Scotland and England in 1707 and presents startling evidence which debunks the myth that the Scottish signatories of the Act of Union were corrupt and bribed by the English.\r\n\r\n‘Bought and sold for English gold’, the phrase immortalised by Robert Burns, has been the accepted wisdom for almost 300 years. That myth is exploded in \"The Scots and the Union\".\r\n\r\nProfessor Whatley, Head of the College of Arts and Social Sciences and Vice Principal at the University of Dundee, spent five years examining archive evidence which shows the opposite is true. In The Scots and the Union, Professor Whatley argues that the Union was an act which benefited Scotland in 1707 and continues to do so now.\r\n\r\nThe book sets out in clear detail the real story of the Union. While Scotland did have debts that were wiped when the Union came into being, the joining of the two nations was much more than a financial agreement - it was a political deal, a practical deal and, most importantly, a deal that was desired by Scotland.\r\n\r\n\"The original aims in writing The Scots and the Union were to convey what the Union of 1707 meant to ordinary Scots at the time, and to tell the story of the passing of this landmark event in Scottish history,\" said Professor Whatley.\r\n\r\n\"How men and women viewed union with England, how they made their voices heard, and what effect it had on everyday lives. This is still the narrative that binds the book together.\"\r\n\r\n\"But as I scoured the sources, some well-known, others - many - little-used previously or not at all, it became apparent that popular accounts of the passage of the Union through the Scottish Parliament were inaccurate and untrue.\"\r\n\r\n\"It became clear that unionists in Scotland were not the traitors they have been portrayed as. Many were principled in their support of a British union that would strengthen Scotland economically and against their enemies - France, the Jacobites and the Catholic Church. Patriotism was certainly not the preserve of the opponents of the Union - even though it is these politicians Scots today are inclined to pay homage to. Unionists too thought and cared deeply about the future of what was a divided - but ambitious - Scottish nation.\"\r\n\r\n\"When I started working on this project none of this was obvious to me, so writing the book has been intriguing, a real voyage of discovery.\"\r\n\r\nThe Scots and the Union is published by Edinburgh University Press.\r\n\r\nProfessor Christopher Whatley is Head of the College of Arts and Social Sciences and Vice Principal at the University of Dundee.

These discussions inform a series of external public seminars.\r\n\r\n'Making Space' is the third public seminar this academic year.  The ResCen artists will engage in conversation with Doreen Massey, Professor of Geography at the Open University.  Doreen is particularly interested in the theorisation of 'space' and 'place'.  Her areas of research range through a critique of globalisation, regional uneven development, and the reconceptualisation of place.  Her modes of working are diverse: from the philosophical and largely conceptual through to the directly political.\r\n\r\nThe Research Associates and Doreen will interrogate notions of space in relation to their individual practices.  Areas of discussion will include: material engagement with place; time/ space and subjectivity/political responsibility; moving beyond surface space; and creating spaces for new thinking.\r\n\r\nThere will be an opportunity for questions and discussion both at the seminar and afterwards on our new online forum at www.rescen.net\r\n\r\nEntrance to the seminar is free.\r\n\r\nTo reserve a place please contact Natalie Daniel.\r\nEmail: rescen@mdx.ac.uk\r\nTelephone: 020 8411 6288/2710\r\n\r\nOur most recent seminars are available to view on the\r\nResCen website:\r\nwww.rescen.net\r\n\r\nDoreen Massey, FBA, FRSA is Professor of Geography at the Open University, Milton Keynes.

What do ribosomes, the structures that build proteins, do when near other molecules? \r\n\r\nFrom the earliest experiments used to examine gases through to the analysis of organic chemicals, mass spectrometry has provided the means for accurately ‘weighing’ atoms and molecules. Recent developments have transformed mass spectrometry to one capable of weighing and identifying individual proteins, underpinning worldwide efforts to define the individual protein components of living cells.  \r\n\r\nMany complex reactions in living cells are carried out by assemblies of proteins held together by weak attractive forces. In this lecture, Carol will describe how she and other researchers developed innovative new mass spectrometry techniques that enable the study of these assemblies giving new insights into how different types of proteins, such as ribosomes, within cells interact with each other.\r\n\r\nProfessor Carol Robinson is the winner of the Royal Society Rosalind Franklin Award 2004.

A series of experiments will be presented that investigate these questions by looking at effects of similarity between words of the bilingual's two languages in terms of orthography, phonology, and semantics.
