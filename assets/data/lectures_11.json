For this reason the tradition gave much attention to the nature of arete (virtue, or excellence) through which, it taught, our life is transformed from the merely human to something bright with divinity.\r\n\r\nBut what is arete? And how do the Platonic primary virtues (wisdom, courage, temperance and justice) emerge in human life? And most important of all, how do we cultivate arete in ourselves? We will read and discuss a short extract from Porphyry (the pupil of Plotinus and a highly regarded philosopher of the 3rd century AD) and explore these questions over two evenings (the first one on the 21st May - but we'll begin this evening with a summary of what was discussed then, so that those who missed it should be able to pick up the thread).\r\n\r\n\r\nNo previous experience of formal philosophy is required.\r\n\r\nEntrance in free, but donations between £3-5 will be welcomed.\r\n\r\nA PDF download of the extract we will be reading is available on our website together with further details of this and other Prometheus Trust's activities: www.prometheustrust.co.uk (the PDF is on the \"London Monday Evenings\" page.)\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 2426, "added": "2018-04-17T21:54:54", "slug": "bda852335140a87a", "speakers": [{"id": 16087, "name": "Peter Lyle", "slug": "peter-lyle"}], "topics": [{"id": 1822, "name": "philosophy", "path": "/academic/religion/religion/philosophy"}, {"id": 2388, "name": "philosophy", "path": "/arts/literature/philosophy/philosophy"}, {"id": 365, "name": "platonism", "path": "/arts/philosophy/platonism"}, {"id": 316, "name": "philosophy", "path": "/arts/art/philosophy"}], "supercategory": "academic", "venue": {"id": 2041, "name": "The Prometheus Trust", "slug": "the-prometheus-trust", "city": "Lydney", "postcode": "GL15 6HG"}, "organizer": {"id": 2041, "name": "The Prometheus Trust", "slug": "the-prometheus-trust"}, "date": "2018-06-04", "dates": [{"id": 16672, "from_date": "2018-06-04", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "19:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Donation", "ticket_info": null, "additional_info": null, "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 2041, "name": "The Prometheus Trust", "slug": "the-prometheus-trust", "city": "Lydney", "postcode": "GL15 6HG"}, "organizer": {"id": 2041, "name": "The Prometheus Trust", "slug": "the-prometheus-trust"}}]}, {"id": 15873, "title": "How Dark Matters Shape The Universe", "synopsis": "5% of the universe is made of real matter and 95% is not.

Whatever the mantra they spout forth, politicians from all the main political parties, other than the left, embrace the need for greater private sector involvement in our health and social care services.  Every politician understands these services are in dire need of top-rate management, discipline and levels of investment. Otherwise our ageing population and unhealthy lifestyles, proliferation of chronic diseases and increasing expectations will send these critical services into melt-down.\r\n\r\nThe NHS already flounders near the bottom of international leagues tables in the treatment of critical conditions. The outcomes for those with lower incomes are particularly poor. So it should be appropriate to consider whether there are other models which we can consider. After all, the staunchest defenders of the NHS must admit that it is a system that is so admired that no other country has copied it.\r\n\r\nIf greater private involvement is the answer, can innovative regulatory and financial structures be envisaged that overcome understandable concerns of the profit-motive driving such a basic need in all of us? Can new technology be used to promote, via financial incentives, healthy lifestyles and reduce expensive medical treatment? Can we handle end-of-life scenarios a whole lot better?\r\n\r\nAnd should the appointment of a Royal Commission on the long-term future of the NHS be the first step in considering the need and purpose of reform. Any changes would require at least some cross-party support and some long-term thinking.\r\n\r\nIn this provocative and timely event Tim Knox – Director of the renowned Think Tank, the Centre for Policy Studies – will address this controversial topic head-on. Is it possible to profoundly rethink our emotional support of the NHS and to bring about a revolution in health and social care in the UK?\r\n\r\nBefore his appointment as Director of the Centre for Policy Studies, Tim Knox was the Editor at the CPS – a position in which he was responsible for publishing papers by every Conservative leader since Mrs Thatcher as well as by hundreds of leading academics and opinion formers.

Their successes included securing the first western media interview with Bin Laden, the first film of the stinger missiles that altered the course of the 1980's war in Afghanistan, key footage of the Romanian revolution, the only uncontrolled footage of the ground conflict in the first Gulf War and footage of the Kosovo conflict that led to British and NATO involvement. The dramatic story of the agency is told by David Loyn of the BBC in his book, recently published in paperback, Frontline: Reporting from the World's Deadliest Places.\r\nThis event is free to attend but please register in advance by clicking the \"book\" link above. The event has been made possible through a grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund with which the Frontline Club Charitable Trust is currently digitising and cataloguing 1,000 hours of FNTV footage. \r\n\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": null, "added": "2012-07-27T15:29:28", "slug": "the-next-chapter-in-a-century-long-conflict", "speakers": [{"id": 12560, "name": "Antony Loewenstein", "slug": "antony-loewenstein"}, {"id": 12561, "name": "Dimi Reider", "slug": "dimi-reider"}, {"id": 12562, "name": "Ahmed Moor", "slug": "ahmed-moor"}, {"id": 395, "name": "Dr Ghada Karmi", "slug": "dr-ghada-karmi"}], "topics": [{"id": 1018, "name": "talk", "path": "/arts/education/debate/talk"}, {"id": 662, "name": "journalism", "path": "/politics/africa/humanrights/journalism"}, {"id": 1420, "name": "journalism", "path": "/politics/centralasia/humanrights/journalism"}, {"id": 1423, "name": "journalism", "path": "/society/centralasia/humanrights/journalism"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 1483, "name": "Frontline Club", "slug": "frontline-club", "city": "London", "postcode": "W2 1QJ"}, "organizer": {"id": 1483, "name": "Frontline Club", "slug": "frontline-club"}, "date": "2012-08-21", "dates": [{"id": 11699, "from_date": "2012-08-21", "to_date": "2012-08-21", "time": "19:00:00", "ticket_cost": "£12.50 Standard, £10 Concession", "ticket_info": "http://www.frontlineclub.com/events/2012/08/", "additional_info": null, "members_only": "No", "members_info": "For more information on becoming a member of Frontline please click here http://www.frontlineclub.com/club/Membership%20form-email.pdf", "venue": {"id": 1483, "name": "Frontline Club", "slug": "frontline-club", "city": "London", "postcode": "W2 1QJ"}, "organizer": {"id": 1483, "name": "Frontline Club", "slug": "frontline-club"}}]}, {"id": 11226, "title": "Sex, Tantra and the Orientalist Imagination", "synopsis": "This evening is for people interested in knowing more about Tantra and about its actual origins and practices.", "keywords": "Pagan, Spirituality, symbolism, ritual, ceremony, pagan altar", "body": "Say Tantra and most people think sex.

There are perennial claims that it may come to dominate us, or in some way undermine human values. In the 5th century BC, Plato’s dialogue the Phaedrus contained an early critique of the technology of writing at the time of its widespread adoption: Socrates voices concerns that writing will undermine human knowledge and authority and will ultimately be destructive to the Athenian polis. We find echoes of this in some of the responses to contemporary media technologies from Wikipedia to Google to Facebook. Some suggest our dependence on a range of digital ‘cognitive extension technologies’, are dumbing down culture, or even changing the nature of human consciousness.\r\n\r\nNeuroscientist Susan Greenfield has argued Facebook and related technologies are in danger of undermining children´s abilities to relate to each in a basic face-to-face manner, though these claims have been fiercely contested. Professor Sherry Turkle, author of the influential book Alone Together has suggested our ‘pathological’ addiction to social media is making us ‘less human’. Others, such as Nicholas Carr, author of The Shallows and novelist Zadie Smith argue it’s ‘flattening us out’, turning us into two-dimensional, dumbed-down, emotionally illiterate consumers.\r\n\r\nYet others believe human intelligence - rather being the simple outcome of evolution on a Pleistocene savannah - is always wrapped up with our use of technology. Our minds are not in the normal sense natural, or fixed. We may indeed think differently from our ancestors before telephones, aeroplanes, pharmacology; everything from the wheel to the locomotive has undoubtedly influenced our social relations and indeed our idea of ourselves as humans. So if human intelligence has always been forged in a relation to technology, is there really anything so special about the new technologies from a cognitive standpoint? Or, do our fears about the cognitive implications of the Web 2.0 say more about today’s cultural climate of determinism and pessimism about the future and a loss of faith in humanity?

This lecture explores what the ideologies and activities of Al Qaeda and related transnational militia might tell us about new forms of political violence in many contemporary societies. Using examples from South Asia, the Middle East, the UK and the USA, the lecture elaborates the aesthetic and cultural universe created by these armed groups and shows how aesthetic elements, as well as ideology, have appeal for some young people. Central to the political ideologies of Al Qaeda and its affiliates are new ideas about how virtue, law and sovereignty should inform politics, including violent political activity. The lecture also considers how novel visions about nature and technology (including, for example, the design of instruments of violence) have been mobilized. The links made by transnational militia between virtue and violence lead to a mixing up of the worlds of the living with the worlds of the dead. This area is explored and its challenging implications for international human rights are drawn out. \r\n\r\nUPDATE: What has been the response of Al Qaeda and related militia to the momentous revolutions in the Middle East and North Africa? What might these events in the Middle East and the continuing violence in South Asia mean for Al Qaeda's future ideas and strategies? \r\n\r\nChetan Bhatt is Professor of Sociology in the Department of Sociology and Director of the Centre for the Study of Human Rights at the LSE.

The word was first used by Mr Tetsori Mori, chief engineer at Yaskawa Corporation in Japan. ‘Mechatronic modules’ comprising of mechanical structure, electrical power and control circuits were developed for sub-system testing to enable higher quality and flexible assembly of robots.

Absolutely nothing. Israeli and Palestinian leaders still show up for peace talks because they have to prove to the world – and the U...S in particular – that they have good intentions. But don't we all really know that it's a game, a farce, a charade? That some of the key demands on the table - the right of return, control of East Jerusalem – are demands the Palestinians will never drop and the Israelis will never accept. That even if by some miracle the leaders did agree, they’d never carry their people with them. Hamas won't accept a deal bartered by Fatah, religious Jews will always insist on retaining the settlements in the West Bank and no democratically elected government could gainsay that and stay in office.\r\n\r\nThis, at any rate, is the story told by the pessimists. But for the optimists it’s the very desperateness of the situation which ratchets up the need for some kind of a deal to be made and thus makes the peace process more plausible. Israel’s leaders simply can’t afford to wait for the demographic time bomb to explode: moderate, secular Israelis are being out-bred both by Israeli Arabs and by the Jewish religious right. They desperately need to come to a settlement before its too late. Which story is the more credible?

But UK content providers must understand the Indian IPR environment and the cultural context in order to address the market. \r\n\r\nEstimates coming out of India suggest that by 2010, India will have 90 million cable and satellite TV households, of which 37 million will be digital fee paying subscribers. The India broadcast industry is expected to be the biggest beneficiary of this growth. This growth points to a very attractive market in the near term, which should warrant the interest of UK content providers.\r\n\r\nThis seminar will address the audience’s concern for IPR transgression in India and raise awareness of what IPR is in India, the value and parameters for transacting it and the mechanisms for enforcing IPR contracts. \r\n\r\nTopics covered include\r\n· Licensing finished programmes for broadcast \r\n· Adaptation of television formats \r\n· International co-production within broadcast \r\n· Impetus for illegal cloning and how to police this within contracts. For example, a licensing format of ‘Who Wants to be a Millionaire’ was a great success in India but this success spawned unlicensed clones among rival channels. \r\n· Can producers of unlicensed clones take legal action in India? \r\n· Structure of IPR deals in India - can UK producers share in ad funded deals, etc? \r\n· What sort of programmes do succeed in India? Do audiences need to be anglophile in their tastes? \r\n· Co-production – hybridisation of UK/global content for local tastes – what are the IPR implications and economics? \r\n\r\nGuest Speaker:\r\n\r\nRichard Parsons, BBC Head of Commercial Affairs\r\nwill address attendees on issues facing the export of intellectual property.

Tonight, Nick Kollerstrom takes us through the planets and their metals, with a particular focus on  alchemy, scientific empirical experiments, traditional astrology and principles of planetary magic. This is a useful talk for anyone who uses planetary sigils and traditional talismans, or who works with Solomonic magic; or is in Alexandrian Wicca, where planetary magic remains a strong component. The speaker is a research fellow at UCL&rsquo;s Department of Science. He is recognised throughout the astrological community for his pioneering studies that have brought his scientific background into exciting fields of research on planets, plants and metals. He has been actively involved in the study of planet-metal associations and other matters of a hermetic nature for 30 years, and has lectured on these subjects since 1975. His work in medical research resulted in his book <em>Lead on the Brain &ndash; A Plain Guide to Britain&rsquo;s No. 1 Pollutant</em>. His investigation of lunar effects upon plant growth led in the 1980s to his gardeners&rsquo; guide <em>Planting by the Moon</em> and the popular annuals <em>Gardening and Planting by the Moon</em>.

In future, quantum devices such as computers, clocks and communications systems could all be more powerful - by an order of magnitude - than today's conventional systems.\r\n\r\nQuantum devices currently only exist in prototype form in the laboratory, but they are already demonstrating enormous potential: storing, processing and transmitting information with efficiencies going way beyond classical physics.  However, developing quantum devices robust enough to be mass-produced outside the lab remains a scientific and technological challenge.   \r\n\r\nRealising the commercial opportunities of quantum will require a high degree of interdisciplinary collaboration, and greater public understanding of Quantum Physics.  In this spirit of inter-disciplinary collaboration, the workshop will bring together pioneering scientific researchers with the business community, entrepreneurs, and the general public.\r\n\r\nThis workshop, which is free to attend, will profile state of the art quantum technologies, addressing both the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.  The format of the workshop is designed to be interactive, with presentations from quantum pioneers in academia and industry, a demonstration session featuring new quantum devices and plenty of opportunities for Q&A.   \r\n\r\nThe workshop is divided into three sessions, each consisting of four 20 minute presentations.  Speakers include Professor Sir Peter Knight, Head of Physics at Imperial College London; Professor Herschel Rabitz, Princeton University; Helen Margolis, National Physics Laboratory; and industry speakers from Hitatchi, MagiQ, Toshiba and HP.    \r\n\r\nPlaces at this event are limited, so we advise early registration. This workshop is organised by the Quantum Technologies Group, a knowledge integration community funded by The Cambridge-MIT Institute.
