If there is something beyond this world of materiality, is there a path out of the cave into the upper world of light? What kind of creatures would we become if we were to find our way to that place? And what kind of responsibilities would follow upon its attainment? We'll begin the evening with a brief talk about the themes of Plato's Republic and the place of the cave story in it.

Modern commentators often suggest that this was merely cultural conditioning, and an aspect of the Platonic tradition which can safely be ignored.   But this upholding of pagan practices continued well into the sixth century AD and so strong was their adherence, that in 529AD the Emperor Justinian forced the closure of the Platonic schools simply because they were the main source of opposition to the contemporary Christian Church and Christianized Imperial power.  Perhaps, then, there were good reasons that these philosophers framed their philosophy within the pagan worldview.  This lecture and study session will look at the metaphysical and theological basis of the Platonic tradition and explore this largely neglected area of philosophy.  We will ask whether a coherent metaphysics is possible without the Gods, and whether human life, both ethical and artistic, is enhanced by a philosophy which affirms that \"all things are full of the Gods.\"\r\n\r\nThe lecture will be timed at around 30 or so minutes, to allow an extensive discussion afterwards.  The evening will be self-contained but for those who are interested we will follow up the lecture with two further sessions in the following two months: one of which will be based on a reading of three pages from Thomas Taylor's introduction to Proclus' Theology of Plato; and the other on a reading of two pages from Proclus' Commentary on the Parmenides of Plato.\r\n\r\nNo previous experience of formal philosophy is required.\r\n\r\nEntrance in free, but donations between £3-5 will be welcomed.\r\n  \r\nMore details on the Prometheus Trust's website: www.prometheustrust.co.uk on the \"London Monday Evenings\" page.\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 2377, "added": "2015-08-18T21:28:27", "slug": "a6164ac72ad3f40e", "speakers": [{"id": 3573, "name": "  Tim Addey", "slug": "tim-addey"}], "topics": [{"id": 3310, "name": "mythology", "path": "/religion/spirituality/spiritualdevelopment/mythology"}, {"id": 1822, "name": "philosophy", "path": "/academic/religion/religion/philosophy"}, {"id": 2388, "name": "philosophy", "path": "/arts/literature/philosophy/philosophy"}, {"id": 365, "name": "platonism", "path": "/arts/philosophy/platonism"}], "supercategory": "religion", "venue": {"id": 3106, "name": "Cecil Sharp House", "slug": "cecil-sharp-house", "city": "London", "postcode": "NW1 7AY"}, "organizer": {"id": 2041, "name": "The Prometheus Trust", "slug": "the-prometheus-trust"}, "date": "2015-09-14", "dates": [{"id": 15392, "from_date": "2015-09-14", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "19:30:00", "ticket_cost": "£5 (concessions £3)", "ticket_info": "Donations at the door.", "additional_info": null, "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 3106, "name": "Cecil Sharp House", "slug": "cecil-sharp-house", "city": "London", "postcode": "NW1 7AY"}, "organizer": {"id": 2041, "name": "The Prometheus Trust", "slug": "the-prometheus-trust"}}]}, {"id": 14864, "title": "Keeping a spotless mind: The neuroscience of 'motivated forgetting'", "synopsis": "People usually consider forgetting to be a problem—a human frailty to be avoided and overcome.

The event examines participatory practice inside and outside the gallery by mapping some of the projects and thoughts from the artists and curators on the panel.\r\n\r\nThe talk will reflect on notions of community as well as questions of audience, skills exchange and co-production.  \r\n\r\nSpeakers include Frances Williams, Katie Orr, artist Albert Potrony and artist Lawrence Bradby.  \r\n\r\nFrances Williams is a writer and curator. She was a contributor to the book Gallery as Community (Whitechapel, 2011) and was formerly Head of Education at the South London Gallery.\r\n\r\nKatie Orr has been Gasworks' Participation Programme Coordinator since 2009. In this time she has developed various projects, events, commissions and residencies within the Even Better Together programme which connects artists with local audiences living and working in Gasworks' neighbourhood of Oval, Vauxhall and Kennington. Projects within Even Better Together include the ongoing intergenerational Peer Group (in collaboration with Albert Potrony) who meet regularly to devise and develop collaborative art projects together, and working with Abigail Hunt on Multiple Voices, a forum which brings project partners and participants of the participation programme together with other professionals working locally, practitioners from other fields, artists and funders in art making sessions. Both the Peer Group and Multiple Voices are durational approaches that test and explore the role contemporary art practice can play within a locally focused setting.     \r\n\r\nAlbert Potrony works with installation, sound and video. Participation is a key element in his projects. His project Faith, a multi-channel video installation with material spanning across Nigeria and the UK, was shown at the Whitstable Museum and Gallery. He previously developed Tate Other, a collaborative video and performance that took place at Tate Modern in September 2012 as part of the Worlds Together Conference.  Albert was commissioned to produce The Potential Space, a 20-minute film, for Anxiety Festival 2014, which looks at the parallels between the process of making objets within a mental health setting and artistic practice. He next project is Another Utopia, a collaborative work that explores the squatting and housing co-operative movements of the late 70s and 80s in London. Albert has been working on participatory projects for galleries and museums for the past ten years, among them Gasworks, Tate, Whitechapel, Camden Arts Centre and Next Generation at the National Theatre.     \r\n\r\nLawrence Bradby is half of the collaborative practice Townley and Bradby. They make work in spaces that are already being used by someone else. This work has included games, picnics, turf twinnings, public conversations and site-specific drawings.\r\n\r\nPart of Koki Tanaka's Precarious Tasks #9, a series of events over a period of 24hrs that he refers to as ‘actions’. The events are programmed within a loose framework shaped by communal involvement and group experiences of everyday rituals that refer to past iterations of his ongoing series of works entitled Precarious Tasks.

After learning all he could from imported prints and books he resolved to cross the Alps to study Italian art at first hand. Rather than travelling to Florence or Rome, Dürer stopped and stayed in Venice. On his arrival, Venetian artists received him with great honour but with some jealousy. The technical brilliance of his graphic work had made a big impact in Italy, yet his paintings were said to lack such qualities as the deep, rich colour for which Venetian art was renowned. Dürer was determined to ‘stop the mouths’ of his critics before returning to effect a revolution, a ‘renaissance’ in the arts in Germany. Close links between Venice and Germany had been long established and this course will examine this direct cultural cross-fertilisation, focusing on works Dürer produced in Italy under the inspiration of Giovanni Bellini, Giorgione and others, together with the influence Dürer’s work had upon them. The relationship between Italian art and other German painters such as Cranach or sculptors such as Riemenschneider will also be covered.", "keywords": "arts, art, history, architecture, classics,DUrer, Giorgione, Titian, Cranach, Riemenschneider, Renaissance arts, Germany,Giovanni Bellini, Giorgione, Venice,15th/early 16th century German sculpture.Altarpieces by Veit Stoss and Tilman Riemenschneider.", "body": "Encouraged by Dürer and others German sculpture, painting and architecture began to radically transform in the 16th century following the classical tradition of\r\nancient Greece and Rome.

Mirza combines a variety of readymade and time-based materials to create audio compositions, which are often realised as site-specific installations. In doing so, Mirza complicates the distinctions between noise, sound and music, and alters the function and meaning of everyday objects and socio-cultural constructs.  Mirza is currently showing in a group show at Tate Modern, Ruins in Reverse, as well as in Sharjah Biennial 11, Re:emerge, Towards a New Cultural Cartography.

Already a best-selling author, physicist and Chair of the SETI Post-Detection Task Group, Paul Davies takes a penetrating look at the aims and assumptions of the SETI enterprise. \r\n\r\nFrank Drake, the young American astronomer who first initiated the search for extra-terrestrial intelligence, has said that SETI is really a search for ourselves-who we are and what our place might be in the grand cosmic scheme of things. Yet, with one tantalizing exception, SETI has produced only negative results. After millions of hours spent eavesdropping on the cosmos, astronomers have detected only the eerie sound of silence. \r\n\r\nWhat does this mean? Are we in fact alone in the vastness of the universe or is ET out there, but not sending any messages our way? Is SETI a waste of time and money? Or should we press ahead with new and more sensitive antennas? And if a signal were to be received, what then? How would we - or should we - respond? \r\n\r\nIn this event, Paul Davies proposes a re-launch of SETI, using a much wider range of scientific tools than radio telescopes which search for narrow band signals. He argues that we should be concentrating on all physical and astronomical anomalies as potential 'signatures of intelligence', citing the search for a 'shadow biosphere' - microbial life on Earth that uses alternative biochemistry. Scientists around the world are responding to his argument and beginning to discuss how the SETI programme could be improved after fifty years of silence.", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": null, "added": "2010-01-06T12:14:44", "slug": "bb2b165f8de4e3a0", "speakers": [{"id": 4382, "name": "Professor Paul Davies", "slug": "professor-paul-davies"}], "topics": [{"id": 1148, "name": "astronomy", "path": "/science/astronomy"}, {"id": 1618, "name": "astrobiology", "path": "/science/biology/astrobiology"}], "supercategory": "science", "venue": {"id": 1729, "name": "The Royal Institution", "slug": "the-royal-institution", "city": "London", "postcode": "W1S 4BS"}, "organizer": {"id": 1729, "name": "The Royal Institution", "slug": "the-royal-institution"}, "date": "2010-03-16", "dates": [{"id": 7979, "from_date": "2010-03-16", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "19:00:00", "ticket_cost": "Tickets cost £8 standard, £6 concessions, £4 Ri Members.", "ticket_info": "For more information visit www.rigb.org or call the Events Team on 020 7409 2992 9.00am-5.00pm Monday to Friday", "additional_info": null, "members_only": "No", "members_info": "To become a member of the Ri please visit www.rigb.org/membership or call 020 7670 2919.", "venue": {"id": 1729, "name": "The Royal Institution", "slug": "the-royal-institution", "city": "London", "postcode": "W1S 4BS"}, "organizer": {"id": 1729, "name": "The Royal Institution", "slug": "the-royal-institution"}}]}, {"id": 7516, "title": "Jack Sheppard: the Surprising Life, Crimes and Escapes of an 18th Century Criminal", "synopsis": "Free Lunchtime lecture by Dr Peter Ross", "keywords": "London, City of London, criminal, prison, escape, 18th Century, Newgate, Bridewell, Tyburn, crime, punishment, history", "body": "\"I am the Sheppard, and all the Gaolers in the Town are my Flock, and I cannot stir into the Country but they are all at my Heels Baughing after me.\"\r\nA free lunchtime talk at Shoe Lane Library.

But what lies behind the news stories?\r\n\r\nMRSA, or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, is one example of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. This means that normal antibiotics aren't powerful enough to kill the bacteria. The most common way MRSA infection spreads is through human contact. If MRSA infects your bloodstream it can lead to serious illness and death.\r\n\r\nMRSA is found in lots of places, but recent scare stories have focused on its appearance in hospitals. One reason hospitals are MRSA hot spots is because advances in modern medicine mean patients can be kept alive for longer by carrying out more invasive procedures, making patients more susceptible to infections which are difficult to control. London has been hit especially hard because of the number of specialist hospitals with very sick patients.\r\n\r\nFewer antibiotics are able to tackle MRSA, compared with other bacteria, so what alternatives are there? Proposed solutions include ensuring wards are kept cleaner, isolating patients and further research into new antibiotics. But experts can't agree what has the best chance of outwitting the bacteria.\r\n\r\nJoin in an open discussion with leading experts from London about how hospitals in the capital can fight the infection.\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 129, "added": "2004-08-27T16:10:35", "slug": "naked-science-infectious-hospitals", "speakers": [{"id": 1464, "name": "Annette Jeanes", "slug": "annette-jeanes"}, {"id": 1465, "name": "Tony Field", "slug": "tony-field"}, {"id": 1466, "name": "Michael Millar", "slug": "michael-millar"}], "topics": [{"id": 170, "name": "newtopic", "path": "/science/chemistry/biochemistry/catalysis/newtopic"}, {"id": 169, "name": "catalysis", "path": "/science/chemistry/biochemistry/catalysis"}, {"id": 458, "name": "policy", "path": "/politics/europe/policy"}, {"id": 431, "name": "science", "path": "/arts/books/science"}], "supercategory": "science", "venue": {"id": 15, "name": "Dana Centre", "slug": "dana-centre", "city": "London", "postcode": "SW7 5HE"}, "organizer": {"id": 46, "name": "Science Museum", "slug": "science-museum"}, "date": "2004-09-16", "dates": [{"id": 1226, "from_date": "2004-09-16", "to_date": "2004-09-16", "time": "19:00:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": "All events are FREE but please pre-book on: 020 7942 4040 or <a href=\"mailto:tickets@danacentre.org.uk\">tickets@danacentre.org.uk</a>", "additional_info": null, "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 15, "name": "Dana Centre", "slug": "dana-centre", "city": "London", "postcode": "SW7 5HE"}, "organizer": {"id": 46, "name": "Science Museum", "slug": "science-museum"}}]}, {"id": 1133, "title": "Living with pain", "synopsis": "This event will be chaired by Claire Rayner and will explore how science is helping those who suffer from all sorts of pain.", "keywords": "Science\r\nHealth\r\nPain\r\n", "body": "Sharp pain, the type you feel when you twist your ankle, is unpleasant but at the same time relatively brief. In contrast, chronic pain can sometimes be felt for months, if not years. From cancer patients, arthritis and MS sufferers to people afflicted with migraines, back pain and all sorts of injuries, the number of people living with chronic pain is staggering. \r\n\r\nBut what is pain and how is this information used by our body? Pain is felt when particular sensory receptors within the nervous system are stimulated by stimuli such as that caused by a tumour or by damage to the surrounding tissue. Impulses triggered by this stimulus travel through our complex nervous systems to the brain to alert us that something is wrong, and when that connection is made, we feel pain. The difficulty with chronic pain is that often it cannot be managed through existing pain control methods. As we gain a deeper understanding of the mechanisms that cause pain, how will this help researchers to develop new treatments and help people to enjoy a pain-free life? \r\n\r\nOpening talks will be given by Prof Anthony Dickenson (Professor of Pharmacology, UCL) and Prof Henry McQuay (Professor of Pain Relief, University of Oxford).
