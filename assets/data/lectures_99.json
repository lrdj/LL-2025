Most people on Earth are becoming aware of this prospect, thanks to technology and climate change scientists. But still the vast majority seem to behave as if it is a chimera. This talk explores that conundrum through an elementary conceit. What if all organisms fundamentally are performed by Earth’s ecologies? What fresh horizons would humans have to imagine for performing ecologically more responsively? Then, as the future is always before its time, our everyday play perhaps could become an evolution that changes everything.

She also has long-standing interests in seventeenth-century Irish drama and the literary culture of the vice-regal \r\ncourt at Dublin Castle. She has published numerous essays on women’s writing and the relationship between writing and trauma, particularly on women’s accounts of the 1641 rebellion/rising, for journals including English Literary Renaissance and Early Modern Women.  She will shortly complete an edition of the letters of the Duchess of Ormonde for the Renaissance English Text Society (2015), and is also developing a monograph provisionally entitled Writing War in Ireland, 1641-60.

Previously, he was the first Director General of the Office of the Third Sector in the Cabinet Office, responsible for leading the Government’s work with the Third Sector.

He became Director of Public Policy in 2001, and was responsible for co–coordinating NCVO's external relations, policy and research work until 2006.\r\n\r\nRebekah Carrier is a solicitor specialising in housing and public law at Hopkin Murray Beskine in Finsbury Park and has a particular interest in the allocation of social housing. Rebekah has acted for groups of tenants dealing with condition of their homes, planned regeneration, disrepair claims, possession and rehousing. She acted in a case for Southwark Law Centre which ensured continued access to legal representation for thousands of tenants threatened with homelessness.  She writes regularly on housing and legal aid issues. Rebekah is currently instructed in a number of high profile cases challenging the “bedroom tax “and benefit cap welfare reforms. \r\n\r\nJames Murray has been the Executive Member for Housing & Development at Islington Council since 2010. In 2011, James made Islington the first local authority to reject the Government’s plans to raise 'affordable' rents, and launched a major building programme of homes for social rent instead. James has also led moves to impose penalties on ‘buy-to-leave’ investors and to stop private landlords renting out sub-standard 'shoebox flats’. He has been a strong advocate for the direct delivery of council services, having brought in-house over a thousand staff including repairs contractors. Before joining the Council’s Executive, James worked for Islington South & Finsbury MP Emily Thornberry, where amongst his projects he assisted in drafting a private members bill to give tenants greater control over housing associations.\r\nBOOK YOUR FREE PLACE by email lectures@wmcollege.ac.uk\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 120, "image_id": 2289, "added": "2015-03-06T20:26:14", "slug": "f096d9ac0342b18e", "speakers": [{"id": 15408, "name": "Ms Rebekah Carrier", "slug": "ms-rebekah-carrier"}, {"id": 15409, "name": "Mr James Murray", "slug": "mr-james-murray"}], "topics": [{"id": 686, "name": "housing", "path": "/arts/architecture/planning/housing"}, {"id": 687, "name": "society", "path": "/arts/architecture/planning/society"}, {"id": 1024, "name": "society", "path": "/arts/literature/french/society"}, {"id": 2687, "name": "society", "path": "/arts/literature/writing/society"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 3030, "name": "Working Men's College", "slug": "working-mens-college", "city": "London", "postcode": "NW1 1TR"}, "organizer": {"id": 3030, "name": "Working Men's College", "slug": "working-mens-college"}, "date": "2015-03-17", "dates": [{"id": 15063, "from_date": "2015-03-17", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "19:00:00", "ticket_cost": "FREE", "ticket_info": "http://www.wmcollege.ac.uk/pages/wmc-lectures.aspx", "additional_info": null, "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 3030, "name": "Working Men's College", "slug": "working-mens-college", "city": "London", "postcode": "NW1 1TR"}, "organizer": {"id": 3030, "name": "Working Men's College", "slug": "working-mens-college"}}]}, {"id": 14496, "title": "Denys Lasdun & The National Theatre - Architectural Masterpiece or was Prince Charles Right After Al", "synopsis": "Famously, Prince Charles once described the National Theatre as a nuclear bunker.

Join Mr Akerson as he shares with LSE Professor Stuart Corbridge the importance of strong leadership in times of great change; his views on the current global economy; and how the LSE helped prepare him for his business success. In addition, you will have the opportunity to pose your own questions to Mr Akerson. \r\n\r\nDaniel F. Akerson is chairman and chief executive officer of General Motors. He joined the company in July, 2009 as a member of the Board of Directors. \r\n\r\nAkerson and his team have moved quickly to re-establish GM as one of the world’s largest automakers and a lynchpin of manufacturing after the company emerged from bankruptcy in July, 2009 during a period of deep global recession. \r\n\r\nUnder Akerson’s leadership, GM has taken critical steps to transform the company by launching a $23 billion IPO – the largest in history – establishing consistent profitability, gaining market share, improving product quality, investing in manufacturing and job creation, and generating impressive global growth. GM holds a leadership position in the world’s two biggest growth markets, Brazil-Russia-India-China (BRIC) and North America. \r\n\r\nAkerson has accelerated GM’s efforts to improve the fuel efficiency of its vehicles. GM today has the best lineup of fuel-efficient vehicles in its history, including the Chevrolet Sonic and Cruze Eco, and the Buick Verano and LaCrosse with eAssist technology. GM is pushing to lead in advanced technology and vehicle electrification with products such as the Chevrolet Volt, Opel Ampera and an all-electric version of the Chevrolet Spark. \r\n\r\nPrior to joining GM, Akerson was a managing director and head of global buyout for The Carlyle Group in Washington, D.C. In this position, Akerson managed more than $50 billion in assets and more than 200 portfolio companies with several hundred thousand employees around the world. He was instrumental in helping Carlyle achieve 30-percent gross internal rates of returns in the firm’s corporate private equity business. \r\n\r\nAkerson also served as CEO or president of several telecommunications and technology companies, including MCI, Nextel Communications, XO Communication and General Instrument, through periods of explosive growth and dynamic change. Under Akerson’s leadership as chief financial officer and president, MCI doubled its market share. \r\n\r\nA graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy with a bachelor of science in engineering, Akerson earned a master’s of science degree in economics from the London School of Economics and Political Science. \r\n\r\nAkerson serves on the Boards of the U.S. Naval Academy Foundation, the Tsinghua University School and Economics and Management Advisory Board, the International Business Leaders Advisory Council of Shanghai, and is a member of the Business Council. He received the T.C. and Elizabeth Cooke Business Medallion from the College of William & Mary in 2004. In addition, he has been honored by the U.S. Naval Academy with the 2012 Distinguished Graduate Award for his lifetime commitment to service, personal character and distinguished contributions to our nation. \r\n\r\nHe co-chaired the “Leaders to Serve the Nation” capital campaign, which raised a record $254 million for the U.S. Naval Academy. Akerson chairs his family’s Blue Earth Foundation, which is dedicated to providing financial assistance to programs serving young people.

We think it wrong that in other cultures people suffer for their sexual orientation, that women are treated as second-class citizens, or that adulterers are put to death. Yet until quite recently our own society was like this too. For most of western history, all sex outside marriage was illegal, and the church, the state, and ordinary people all devoted huge efforts to suppressing and punishing it. This was a central feature of Christian civilization, one that had steadily grown in importance since the early middle ages. \r\n\r\nIn his new book which he will discuss in this lecture, Faramerz Dabhoiwala describes in dramatic detail how, between 1600 and 1800, this entire world view was shattered by revolutionary new ideas - that sex is a private matter; that morality cannot be imposed by force; that men are more lustful than women. Henceforth, the private lives of both sexes were to be endlessly broadcast and debated, in a rapidly expanding universe of public media: newspapers, pamphlets, journals, novels, poems, and prints. \r\n\r\nThe Origins of Sex| shows that the creation of this modern culture of sex was a central part of the Enlightenment, intertwined with the era's major social, political and intellectual trends. It helped create a new model of Western civilization, whose principles of  privacy, equality, and freedom of the individual remain distinctive to this day.\r\n \r\nFaramerz Dabhoiwala was born in England, grew up in Amsterdam, and was educated at York and Oxford. He is the Senior Fellow in History at Exeter College, Oxford, a Fellow of the Royal Historical Society, and the father of two children.   \r\n\r\nSuggested hashtag for this event for Twitter users: #lsesex \r\n\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 732, "added": "2011-12-11T22:49:40", "slug": "1560288d00232f1a", "speakers": [{"id": 11835, "name": "Dr  Faramerz  Dabhoiwala", "slug": "dr-faramerz-dabhoiwala"}], "topics": [{"id": 2692, "name": "history", "path": "/arts/finearts/film/film/history"}, {"id": 106, "name": "wwi", "path": "/arts/books/history/military/wwi"}, {"id": 107, "name": "wwii", "path": "/arts/books/history/military/wwii"}, {"id": 108, "name": "army", "path": "/arts/books/history/military/army"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 1517, "name": "Hong Kong Theatre, Clement House", "slug": "hong-kong-theatre-clement-house", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC2A 2AE"}, "organizer": {"id": 1287, "name": "London School of Economics & Political Science", "slug": "london-school-of-economics-political-science"}, "date": "2012-02-07", "dates": [{"id": 10986, "from_date": "2012-02-07", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "18:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": "This event is free and open to all with no ticket required.

M1 5LE \r\n\r\nKenneth Grant is a much-admired figure in the world of Thelema. Exponent of a distinct magical gnosis and writer of many books, he has produced a formidable and highly creative body of work, expressing approaches to magic and mysticism which have evolved throughout the years. At the heart of this work is the series of Typhonian Trilogies, commencing with The Magical Revival in 1972 and culminating in The Ninth Arch in 2002. In this talk Michael Staley will discuss the fundamental aspects of this work, as well as the ways in which Grant set out to develop Thelema and creative occultism in the light of the Typhonian or Draconian Current.\r\n\r\nGrant’s work has grown out of an extraordinary life. He had a passion for magic, mysticism and comparative religion by the time he met Aleister Crowley in 1944 -- a contact which made a profound impact upon him. Later, he and his wife had a close association with the occult artist Austin Osman Spare. Spare’s work also had a huge influence upon Grant, but it was through his own magical and mystical experience that Grant was able to assimilate the work of these two and many others including Woodroffe, Massey, Blavatsky, and Lovecraft to form a vision that suffuses all his work but finds its most profound flowering in the Typhonian Trilogies. This lecture focuses on Grant’s work as expressed in the Typhonian Trilogies, and lays the foundation for a forthcoming series of talks which will focus more closely on specific elements of his work. \r\n\r\nMichael Staley is a prominent member of the Typhonian Order headed by Kenneth Grant, has been Grant’s editor and publisher for many years, edits the well-respected journal Starfire, and is the founder of Starfire Publishing Ltd. Steeped in Thelema since the late 1960s, he speaks from time to time on aspects of the work of Aleister Crowley, Kenneth Grant, Austin Osman Spare, and others. \r\n\r\nPrice: £7.00\r\nTime: 7.00 for a 7.30 start\r\n\r\nTo reserve a place please contact me at cerne@hotmail.co.uk.

It is probably the only talk on LSD in which you'll hear the words of the Reverend Ian Paisley.\r\n\r\nAndy Roberts is the author of several books on folklore, UFOs, cryptozoologyand popular culture. His overall interest is in the strangeness of the multiverse and what and why people choose to believe. Besides his books Andy has written for numerous magazines including Fortean Times, where he currently co-writes a monthly sceptical UFO column. His magazine articles have dealt with cults, the Grateful Dead and telepathy, the search for the Death Ray and a great deal of other weirdness. He once edited an Incredible String Band fanzine and is really quite obsessive about the Grateful Dead.\r\n\r\nHis interest in LSD stems from his first acid trip in 1971 when the ultimate force of evil foretold the future to him. He's still waiting for that particular future to manifest but followed the Prince of Darkness' strange invitation into the labyrinth of 1970s counter culture to see what he could find.\r\n\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 1303, "added": "2010-01-12T19:32:16", "slug": "f61cc92e6db392ea", "speakers": [{"id": 9264, "name": "Andy Roberts", "slug": "andy-roberts"}], "topics": [{"id": 1474, "name": "culture", "path": "/academic/society/culture/culture"}, {"id": 314, "name": "culture", "path": "/arts/philosophy/culture"}, {"id": 1248, "name": "culture", "path": "/academic/society/culture"}, {"id": 474, "name": "culture", "path": "/religion/culture"}], "supercategory": "academic", "venue": {"id": 449, "name": "The October Gallery", "slug": "the-october-gallery", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC1N 3AL"}, "organizer": {"id": 449, "name": "The October Gallery", "slug": "the-october-gallery"}, "date": "2010-01-26", "dates": [{"id": 8020, "from_date": "2010-01-26", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "18:00:00", "ticket_cost": "Entry £7 /£5 Concessions", "ticket_info": "Email rentals@octobergallery.co.uk or call 44 (0)20 7831 1618", "additional_info": "Arrive 6pm for a 6:30pm Start - Wine available\r\nPlease reserve your place as space is limited.\r\n\r\n\r\n", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 449, "name": "The October Gallery", "slug": "the-october-gallery", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC1N 3AL"}, "organizer": {"id": 449, "name": "The October Gallery", "slug": "the-october-gallery"}}]}, {"id": 7567, "title": "Education for Sustainable Development", "synopsis": "LSE Sustainability in Practice lecture", "keywords": "Sustainability, resources, natural, University, development, international development", "body": "This event will explore the role of universities in driving the sustainability agenda.", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 732, "added": "2009-12-16T14:40:19", "slug": "education-for-sustainable-development", "speakers": [{"id": 1992, "name": "Mr  Tony Juniper", "slug": "mr-tony-juniper"}], "topics": [{"id": 1576, "name": "development", "path": "/society/media/media/development"}, {"id": 1001, "name": "sustainability", "path": "/science/biology/sustainability/sustainability"}, {"id": 1795, "name": "sustainability", "path": "/politics/environment/environment/sustainability"}, {"id": 373, "name": "development", "path": "/academic/linguistics/development"}], "supercategory": "society", "venue": {"id": 1520, "name": "New Theatre, London School of Economics & Political Science", "slug": "new-theatre-london-school-of-economics-political-science", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC2A 2AE"}, "organizer": {"id": 1287, "name": "London School of Economics & Political Science", "slug": "london-school-of-economics-political-science"}, "date": "2010-03-04", "dates": [{"id": 7917, "from_date": "2010-03-04", "to_date": "2010-03-04", "time": "18:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": null, "additional_info": "This event is free and open to all with no ticket required.

Franklin’s place in the excitement of the Enlightenment, the early scientific discoveries, the pursuit of new forms of societal relationships, the inspiration behind the Industrial Revolution, and, above all the search for practical progress. All in contrast with the more literary and intellectual interests of Johnson and his circle.

Folk music often seems squeezed from above and below. Pop music, and the folk-fusions that follow in its wake, are seen by some purists as diluting the folk tradition. At the same time it seems that this ‘people’s culture’ is scorned by the cultural establishment. In the last few years, however, a revival of English folk music has seen a plethora of new folk styles sprout up, from nu-folk to twisted folk, from Bat for Lashes to Tunng and even twindie, a new generation seems to be giving folk new meaning and an unexpected lease of life. Has folk finally left behind its parochial, twee image? \r\n\r\nPolitics seems to be an essential part of the revival. From the Levellers’ Battle of the Beanfield to Clan Dyken’s ‘eco-folk’, have ‘new age’ subcultures and green politics helped to recover folk’s radical roots? Some hope a revived folk tradition might help create a more ‘radical’ English identity and heritage, an alternative to the flag-waving jingoism of Rule Britannia. Liberal peer Lord Redesdale wants to have 14,000 morris dancers at the 2012 Olympics. But is folk in danger of being co-opted and sanitised just as it seems to be reinvigorated? At the start of the 20th century progressive enthusiasts propagated the idea that folk music could reconnect ‘the people’ with their past, and with each other, and inspire a collective outlook. In the very different political context of the 21st century, is folk music fulfilling its potential, or is it just another brand?\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 120, "image_id": null,

Will Hutton, chief executive of The Work Foundation, here and in his provocative and stimulating new book warns instead that China is running up against a set of daunting challenges from within that could well derail its rise and, in turn, deliver a crippling shock to the global economy. Britain, Europe and the US must recognise that they have a vital stake in assuring that collapse does not happen. \r\n\r\nChina's effect on our lives is reflected in our house prices, the inequality in our wages and the prices we pay in our shops. Yet China is burdened by a weak enterprise system, growing social protest and environmental degradation. \r\n\r\nHutton will show how the contradictions of an authoritarian state are fundamentally disabling and argues that if China is to complete the transition to capitalism upon which it has embarked, it has no choice but to embrace the mechanisms that make business and government accountable to people - from a free press to representative governance. This is a powerful warning that global peace and prosperity depend upon successful transition. \r\n\r\nWill Hutton is chief executive of The Work Foundation, an independent, not for dividend research based consultancy which is the most influential voice on work, workplace and employment issues in Britain.

But there is more to fireworks than meets the eye. Do you know how they get to be so colourful? Or how to make the biggest bang? Well believe it or not, it’s all down to the wonders of chemistry. Join us to explore the science behind the great traditions of ‘bonfire night’. Experience the flashes, whizzes and bangs of exploding chemistry in the Faraday Lecture Theatre, and learn the secrets of toffee apples – how do simple sugar crystals manage to turn into such a delicious sticky coating? Stay around after the event for free soft drinks and nibbles. There will be a prize for the best Guy, so get creative!

A distinguished panel of speakers will examine the variety of styles associated with the Georgian interior, consider how these interiors were used and understood by contemporaries and what they mean to us today.  \r\n\r\nAs well as discussing the key styles associated with the Georgian period, and the revival and survival of certain eighteenth-century aesthetic choices in the modern age, the conference will also address how interior space was created, structured and experienced.  What role did professionals play in the design of contemporary interiors? How did contemporaries furnish their homes and how did they experience life indoors?  Who led taste and what was the relationship between Palladianism, neo-classicism, the gothic and the &#8216;Georgian&#8217;?  Why has Georgian architecture come to be so popular and so protected, and where can we find the &#8216;Georgian interior&#8217; today?\r\n\r\nThe conference will be of special interest to architectural historians, design historians, art historians, social and cultural historians, cultural geographers, museum curators, members of heritage bodies and other scholars studying the history of design and the eighteenth century.  \r\n\r\nThe conference is supported by The Paul Mellon Centre for Studies in British Art (and the British Academy).\r\n\r\nTicket includes morning coffee, sandwich lunch, afternoon tea and free admission to the exhibition International Arts and Crafts.
