Embedded in the world around us, they display rich observable behaviours which can serve as object lessons for principles of learning, communication, social organization, and adaptation to environmental change. In neuroscience, study of birds has produced striking insights into the structural plasticity of brain circuits controlling behaviour, and more recently into the dynamic role of the genome in brain function.  In songbirds, different “neurogenomic states” (patterns of brain gene expression) are elicited by different experiences and environmental contexts, suggesting a role in cognition. For example, shifts in neurogenomic state occur when birds communicate through birdsong. For birds that normally live in social groups, the experience of being all alone elicits yet another neurogenomic state.  In each of these examples, the genes involved have clear orthologues in humans, though it is impossible to study gene activity directly in the brains of humans. Studying birds will help us to understand the deep mechanisms that link social experience, brain gene activity and adaptive behaviour.\r\n\r\nThe lecture will be followed by a networking drinks reception. \r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 60, "image_id": 2579, "added": "2016-09-08T09:29:53", "slug": "9cf9248290f39aeb", "speakers": [{"id": 16309, "name": "Professor David Clayton", "slug": "professor-david-clayton"}], "topics": [{"id": 1396, "name": "biology", "path": "/academic/science/philosophy/engineering/biology"}, {"id": 170, "name": "newtopic", "path": "/science/chemistry/biochemistry/catalysis/newtopic"}, {"id": 999, "name": "biology", "path": "/science/biology/naturalhistory/biology"}, {"id": 3060, "name": "biology", "path": "/academic/health/medicine/biology"}], "supercategory": "academic", "venue": {"id": 3218, "name": "Skeel Lecture Theatre, People's Palace", "slug": "skeel-lecture-theatre-peoples-palace", "city": "London", "postcode": "E1 4NS"}, "organizer": {"id": 3213, "name": "Events Office, Queen Mary University of London", "slug": "events-office-queen-mary-university-of-london"}, "date": "2016-10-25", "dates": [{"id": 16096, "from_date": "2016-10-25", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "18:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": "https://canariesinacoalmine.eventbrite.co.uk ", "additional_info": "For further information contact: b.prescott@qmul.ac.uk or visit www.qmul.ac.uk/events/meetprofessors/\r\n", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 3218, "name": "Skeel Lecture Theatre, People's Palace", "slug": "skeel-lecture-theatre-peoples-palace", "city": "London", "postcode": "E1 4NS"}, "organizer": {"id": 3213, "name": "Events Office, Queen Mary University of London", "slug": "events-office-queen-mary-university-of-london"}}]}, {"id": 15393, "title": "The Folio Academy Sessions, Shakespeare reimagined: Jeanette Winterson on the Gap of Time ", "synopsis": "Jeanette Winterson talks about her new book\r\n", "keywords": "Literature, story telling, Folio", "body": "Jeanette Winterson talks about her new book\r\n\r\n‘All of us have talismanic texts that we have carried around and that carry us around.

The Prince’s family scoffed at Rosemary’s chequered family pedigree and dismissed the love-weary Prince’s designs, leaving Rosemary, a heroic Red Cross nurse during the Great War, to be swept into marriage by Eric, Viscount Ednam, a close friend of Edward, and heir to an ancient English Earldom. The Ednams became a dynamic couple of the Bright Young Things era of the 1920s, but in July, 1930 at the peak of their chaotic life together, Rosemary met her sudden death in a horrific aeroplane crash, which also killed three of her fellow aristocrats. The unexplained accident (which remains unsolved even today) caused giant ripples across the whole of British Society. Rumours were rife of sabotage, especially as it was said that Edward, Prince of Wales, had only just escaped death in the same crash by changing his travel plans at the last minute. Will Cross (author of several biographies on the British gentry) unravels Rosemary’s life and times and offers some startling and sinister facts about the aftermath of her tragic death.

He never found a crashed flying saucer, or received a visit from the sinister Men In Black. Instead he discovered something no less astonishing.\r\n\r\nHow UFOS Conquered The World describes David’s strange journey to the heart of the UFO phenomenon.

It is a “Free Trade” deal with the United States currently under consideration by the European Union. Trade deals used to be about removing import tariffs.

Such barriers, which are hard-won protections to the consumer, would progressively disappear.\r\n  \r\nThe truly frightening thing is the proposal to set up an extra-governmental body to govern disputes between investors and government: the Investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) provision. It enables investors to sue governments for unlimited amounts, with costs falling on the latter, if regulations or decisions damage or impede their profits, and effectively force a reversal of policy. This exists in other ‘free trade’ deals with the USA, and such actions are already being taken against other countries: e.g., over warnings and plain packaging of cigarettes, and the decision to close nuclear power plants, and even over minimum wage legislation. The proposed ‘court’ is not subject to any other state or EU judicial system.\r\n\r\nFrancis Fukuyama wrote a much-derided book, The End of History, that saw as its endpoint the conclusion of the Cold War and the dominance of Capitalism as the way of providing for ourselves.

It told of the rise and fall of a gang of Jewish hoodlums from the Lower East Side in New York, over a forty year time span. Leone was determined not to make\r\na film about the usual Italian or Irish gangsters - but instead to focus ona community which had more rarely been featured in Hollywood thrillers. When the film opened in America it was severely cut and opinions were sharply divided on whether it was convincing or not. \r\n\r\nProfessor Sir Christopher Frayling was until recently Rector of the Royal College of Art and Chair of the Arts Council England. An award-winning broadcaster and regular contributor to BBC radio and television, he haswritten eighteen books – among them the acclaimed biography of the Italian director Sergio Leone and a detailed study of his films. He is Professor Emeritus of Cultural History at the RCA and a Fellow of Churchill College, Cambridge.

Then, in one extraordinary moment in the French Revolution, the Jews of France were emancipated. Soon the ghetto gates were opened all over Europe. The era of Emancipation had begun. What happened next would change the course of history.\r\nMichael Goldfarb tells the story of how this isolated minority emerged from the ghetto and against terrible odds very quickly established themselves as shapers of history, as writers, revolutionaries, social thinkers, and artists. Their struggle to create a place for themselves in Western European life led to revolutions and nothing less than a second renaissance in Western culture spanning the era from the French Revolution to the beginning of the twentieth century. The story is told through the lives of the people who lived through this momentous change.\r\nSome are well-known: Marx, Freud, Mahler, Proust, and Einstein; many more have been forgotten. This talk will have meaning for anyone interested in the struggle of immigrants and minorities to succeed. We live in a world where vast numbers are on the move, where religions and races are grinding against each other in new combinations.\r\nMichael Goldfarb is an author, journalist and broadcaster. He has written for The Guardian, The New York Times and The Washington Post but is best known for his work in public radio. Throughout the 1990&#8242;s, as NPR’s London Correspondent and then Bureau Chief, he covered conflicts and conflict resolution from Northern Ireland to Bosnia to Iraq for NPR.\r\nFrom 2000, through mid 2005, Goldfarb made documentaries for the public radio program Inside Out. One of these, Ahmad’s War: Inside Out, became the basis for his first book, Ahmad’s War, Ahmad’s Peace: Surviving Under Saddam, Dying in the New Iraq, which was named a New York Times Notable Book of 2005. The book has just been published on Kindle.\r\nHis most recent book is, Emancipation: How Liberating Europe’s Jews from the Ghetto Led to Revolution and Renaissance.\r\nHis work has been given the highest honours on both sides of the Atlantic including the DuPont-Columbia Award and Overseas Press Club’s Lowell Thomas Award in America and the Sony Gold award in Britain.

Perhaps the most fundamental advance based on space observations led to the development of classical mechanics in order to understand the motions of the planets and comets and concomitantly the development of calculus, one of the greatest of mathematical achievements.   \r\n\r\nWith the advent of astrophysics and the associated technologies we have been able to see to the very edge of the Universe and make a plethora of discoveries about all aspects of the Universe from the occupants of the space between stars to the processes occurring deep inside stars. The universe has been found to be a veritable Pandora's Box, full to the brim with fascinating and exotic molecules, dust particles and also some highly puzzling material responsible for some as yet unidentified spectroscopic features.  These latter are known as the Diffuse Interstellar Bands (DIBs) first observed in the 1920s.\r\n \r\nParticularly fascinating, curious and crucial has been the role that the element carbon has played in almost every aspect of the development of our understanding of both the physical and natural sciences.  The most recent big surprise that the element had up its sleeve was the existence of C60, Buckminsterfullerene, the third well-defined form of carbon.  The discovery was made serendipitously in 1985 during laboratory experiments which attempted to explain the chemical synthesis of some unusually long linear carbon chain molecules detected in the interstellar medium in the 1970’s.  A second aim of these experiments tested whether the carriers of the DIBs might be long linear carbon chains.  \r\n\r\nOn the basis of such revelations the suggestion that C60 might exist in space and be responsible for the DIBs seemed an as good, if not a better, possibility than most other ideas that had heretofore been proposed.  Especially compelling support for the idea that C60 existed in space lay in the fact that the original discovery was made serendipitously during laboratory experiments designed to simulate the atmospheric conditions in cool red giant carbon stars.  This conjecture has just been confirmed by Cami et al who have found infra red bands in the spectra obtained by NASA’s Spitzer satellite telescope.  \r\n\r\nThis is yet another example of the remarkably synergistic relationship between terrestrial and space science.  In these difficult times it lends useful support for the fundamental value of \"Blue Skies\" or perhaps more accurately “Black Skies” cross-disciplinary research.  All these results taken together suggest that the 90 year-old mystery of the carrier of the DIBs might be close to being resolved at long last.", "additional_info": null, "duration": 60, "image_id": null, "added": "2011-04-13T20:13:39", "slug": "e6112502fb80283b", "speakers": [{"id": 11079, "name": "Sir Harry Kroto", "slug": "sir-harry-kroto"}], "topics": [{"id": 143, "name": "chemistry", "path": "/science/chemistry"}, {"id": 1148, "name": "astronomy", "path": "/science/astronomy"}, {"id": 230, "name": "space", "path": "/science/space"}, {"id": 69, "name": "science", "path": "/science"}, {"id": 2515, "name": "carbon", "path": "/science/chemistry/carbon"}], "supercategory": "science", "venue": {"id": 2, "name": "The Royal Institution of Great Britain", "slug": "the-royal-institution-of-great-britain", "city": "London", "postcode": "W1S 4BS"}, "organizer": {"id": 2, "name": "The Royal Institution of Great Britain", "slug": "the-royal-institution-of-great-britain"}, "date": "2011-06-24", "dates": [{"id": 10130, "from_date": "2011-06-24", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "20:00:00", "ticket_cost": "Free to Ri Full Members/ £10 Associate Members, £15 Non-Members", "ticket_info": "www.rigb.org", "additional_info": null, "members_only": "No", "members_info": "Available through the website, www.rigb.org.\r\n", "venue": {"id": 2, "name": "The Royal Institution of Great Britain", "slug": "the-royal-institution-of-great-britain", "city": "London", "postcode": "W1S 4BS"}, "organizer": {"id": 2, "name": "The Royal Institution of Great Britain", "slug": "the-royal-institution-of-great-britain"}}]}, {"id": 9633, "title": "When East Beats West", "synopsis": "'Burning Issue' public lecture", "keywords": "international relations, power, the West, United States, US, India, China", "body": "China will soon overtake the United States as the world's largest economy.

Can we reduce regulation and allow a diverse range of qualifications, but still maintain comparability?\r\n\r\nIn this talk Professor Coe will propose a structure for doing this. The starting point is that there is no such thing as absolute comparability, only comparability for a specific purpose. For key purposes such as using qualifications to select applicants to higher education, or for school accountability, there are a number of statistical models that can be used to define comparability at the point of use, rather than in the process of awarding. These would allow awarding bodies to define, judge and certify outcomes as they see fit, but then to assign different values to those certified outcomes (eg grades) according to their relevance to the particular purpose being considered. Examples will be given, together with a discussion of pros and cons of different approaches.\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 1403, "added": "2011-01-07T08:18:09", "slug": "e8debfe92c0baf9c", "speakers": [{"id": 10604, "name": "Professor Robert Coe", "slug": "professor-robert-coe"}], "topics": [{"id": 743, "name": "education", "path": "/academic/arts/linguistics/education"}, {"id": 2192, "name": "assessment", "path": "/academic/education/assessment"}, {"id": 744, "name": "education", "path": "/academic/linguistics/education"}, {"id": 745, "name": "education", "path": "/arts/language/education"}], "supercategory": "academic", "venue": {"id": 2304, "name": "Cambridge Assessment - 9 Hills Road", "slug": "cambridge-assessment-9-hills-road", "city": "Cambridge", "postcode": "CB2 1PB"}, "organizer": {"id": 2297, "name": "Cambridge Assessment Network", "slug": "cambridge-assessment-network"}, "date": "2011-04-28", "dates": [{"id": 9584, "from_date": "2011-04-28", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "15:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": null, "additional_info": "To book a place please contact the Network Team on 01223 553846 or thenetwork@cambridgeassessment.org.uk.", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 2304, "name": "Cambridge Assessment - 9 Hills Road", "slug": "cambridge-assessment-9-hills-road", "city": "Cambridge", "postcode": "CB2 1PB"}, "organizer": {"id": 2297, "name": "Cambridge Assessment Network", "slug": "cambridge-assessment-network"}}]}, {"id": 9176, "title": "Untold Stories: The Kitchener Camp", "synopsis": "A special lecture on the Kitchener Camp at the Wiener Library to mark Holocaust Memorial Day 2011.", "keywords": "Holocaust\r\nKent\r\nJewish\r\nRefugee\r\nCamp\r\nKitchener", "body": "To mark Holocaust Memorial Day 2011, the Wiener Library will be holding a special lecture by Prof Clare Ungerson on The Kitchener Camp, a largely forgotten camp established in 1939 for 4000 male Jewish refugees situated near Sandwich in East Kent.\r\n\r\nClare Ungerson is Emeritus Professor of Social Policy at the University of Southampton.

But in his book Supernatural, the background to his talk at the October Gallery, Graham Hancock presents staggering new information that experiences induced by plant hallucinogens may have played a vital role in the evolution of our species – opening our ancestors to supernatural realms and making us truly human for the first time. It all happened very recently.\r\nLess than 50,000 years ago mankind had no art, no religion, no sophisticated symbolism, no innovative thinking. Then, in a dramatic and electrifying change, described by scientists as ‘the greatest riddle in human history’, all the skills and qualities that we value most highly in ourselves appeared already fully formed, as though bestowed on us by hidden powers.  In his lecture, Graham Hancock sets out to investigate this mysterious ‘before-and-after moment’ and to discover the truth about the influences that shaped the modern human mind. His quest takes him on a journey of adventure and detection from the stunningly beautiful painted caves of prehistoric France, Spain and Italy to remote rock shelters in the mountains of South Africa where he finds a treasure trove of extraordinary Stone Age art.\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 150, "image_id": 1149, "added": "2009-05-25T10:23:53", "slug": "supernatural-did-psychedelic-experiences-make-our-ancestors-human", "speakers": [{"id": 8275, "name": "Graham Hancock", "slug": "graham-hancock"}], "topics": [], "supercategory": "academic", "venue": {"id": 449, "name": "The October Gallery", "slug": "the-october-gallery", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC1N 3AL"}, "organizer": {"id": 449, "name": "The October Gallery", "slug": "the-october-gallery"}, "date": "2009-05-26", "dates": [{"id": 7001, "from_date": "2009-05-26", "to_date": "2009-05-26", "time": "18:00:00", "ticket_cost": " £7 /£5 Concessions", "ticket_info": null, "additional_info": null, "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 449, "name": "The October Gallery", "slug": "the-october-gallery", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC1N 3AL"}, "organizer": {"id": 449, "name": "The October Gallery", "slug": "the-october-gallery"}}]}, {"id": 6751, "title": "Imagination in Economics: Uncertainty, Metaphor, and What Economics Can Learn from the Romantics", "synopsis": "Are we over-reliant on reason?", "keywords": "European, Philosophy, Romantic, Economics, Philosophy, reason, Economy, creativity", "body": "Is over-reliance on reason at the root of the present economic crisis?

Rogers.\r\n\r\nSpecies adapt to the environment over millennia, and reproduction is therefore highly controlled by environment, but what happens when the environment changes more quickly than expected? Will reproduction go wrong or is it sufficiently robust to cope?\r\n\r\nThe symposium will examine the ways in which environmental change, such as global warming, increased radiation and exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals, influence not only short-term reproductive success and development, but also long-term survival and fitness. We will focus on the following questions:\r\n\r\n• Will environmental change lead to mismatches between food supplies, optimal physical environments and reproductive demands?\r\n\r\n• How will these changes interact at the population level to cause the collapse or alteration of food web structures?\r\n\r\n• What are the direct effects of environmental stresses (e.g. temperature, drought, environmental pollutants) on the reproductive success of individuals and populations?\r\n\r\n• To what extent do environmental stresses during early life affect adult health through developmental programming mechanisms?\r\n\r\nIn this symposium, experts in ecology, nutrition, reproductive physiology, developmental biology and molecular biology share their insights into these questions.\r\n\r\nOrganised by William V.

", "keywords": "plastic, environment, recycling, ", "body": "You need only look at any UK street to see problems caused by the accumulation of waste plastics – they clog drains, pose a deadly threat to wildlife and generally cause a blot on the landscape. In the past 50 years, the plastics industry has seen tremendous growth, and plastic products are now an integral part of our lifestyle. But with lifespans that can stretch into decades (and sometimes beyond), some of the very attributes that make plastics so useful – their strength and durability – mean that their disposal is a mounting problem. Sustainable development demands environmentally and economically sound solutions to the disposal of waste, but plastics account for only a small proportion of material recovery, and their disposal is associated with a number of problems. Lucky for us then, that experts in sustainable materials processing are exploring novel ways to recycle waste plastics. While iron and steel making currently make use of carbon from non-renewable coal resources, various carbon-based polymers can also be used, and waste plastics provide an excellent equivalent source. Join Veena, recent winner of the British Council 2004 Fresh Innovators Award in Australia, as she explains how she is exploiting this fact, and how plastic waste may well become a valuable resource in electric arc furnace steel making, providing a myriad of environmental benefits and cost savings, as well as effective disposal of the waste plastics. \r\n\r\nVeena Sahajwalla is the Director of Sustainable Materials Processing Research in the School of Materials Science and Engineering at the University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia, where her research focuses on sustainability of materials processing. \r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": null, "added": "2005-04-22T13:40:34", "slug": "8e794ef956a537e3", "speakers": [{"id": 2361, "name": "Professor Veena Sahajwalla", "slug": "professor-veena-sahajwalla"}], "topics": [{"id": 570, "name": "environment", "path": "/science/environment/environment"}, {"id": 225, "name": "environment", "path": "/science/environment"}], "supercategory": "science", "venue": {"id": 509, "name": "The Royal Institution of Great Britain", "slug": "the-royal-institution-of-great-britain", "city": "London", "postcode": "W1S 4BS"}, "organizer": {"id": 509, "name": "The Royal Institution of Great Britain", "slug": "the-royal-institution-of-great-britain"}, "date": "2005-05-03", "dates": [{"id": 1935, "from_date": "2005-05-03", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "19:00:00", "ticket_cost": "£8 standard, £5 concessions", "ticket_info": "www.rigb.org or by telephoning 020 7409 2992.", "additional_info": "Nearest tube station is Green Park", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 509, "name": "The Royal Institution of Great Britain", "slug": "the-royal-institution-of-great-britain", "city": "London", "postcode": "W1S 4BS"}, "organizer": {"id": 509, "name": "The Royal Institution of Great Britain", "slug": "the-royal-institution-of-great-britain"}}]}, {"id": 1723, "title": "The environment in Bede's day", "synopsis": "Jacqui Huntley, English Heritage North East Regional Advisor for Archaeological Science, looks at what the environment was like in eighth-century Northumbria.", "keywords": "Archaeology, history, environment, Bede", "body": null, "additional_info": null, "duration": 60, "image_id": 353, "added": "2005-04-15T15:49:26", "slug": "the-environment-in-bedes-day", "speakers": [{"id": 2160, "name": "Dr Jacqui Huntley", "slug": "dr-jacqui-huntley"}], "topics": [{"id": 124, "name": "archaeology", "path": "/academic/archaeology"}], "supercategory": "academic", "venue": {"id": 580, "name": "Bede's World", "slug": "bedes-world", "city": "Jarrow", "postcode": "NE32 3DY"}, "organizer": {"id": 580, "name": "Bede's World", "slug": "bedes-world"}, "date": "2005-04-23", "dates": [{"id": 1790, "from_date": "2005-04-23", "to_date": "2005-04-23", "time": "1 day, 0:00:00", "ticket_cost": "Museum admission charge applies", "ticket_info": "Museum reception, contact 0191 489 2106 or visitor.info@bedesworld.co.uk", "additional_info": "See website for details of opening times and admission prices.
