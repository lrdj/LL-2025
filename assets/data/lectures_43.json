", "synopsis": "Critics have mauled the writing, but could the success of Fifty Shades be a good thing for women, and women’s writing, in the long run?", "keywords": "Literature, Women, Debate, Feminist, Pornography", "body": "The phenomenal success of EL James’ sadomasochist novels has led many to conclude women’s erotic fiction has jumped out from its niche and into the mainstream. The sixteenth-century music featured in the book hit the top of the classical charts, while sex boutiques reported big increases in sales of S&M paraphernalia. But this so-called mummy-porn is much less sexually explicit than previous erotic fiction for women, and is widely read in public.\r\n\r\nHarold Robbins’ steamy potboilers were far more pornographic and perverted in the 1970s, as were 1980s bonk-busters and 1990s chick-lit. Fifty Shades started as a blog, but it did not borrow its literary style from the burgeoning sphere of female erotic literature. Stephenie Meyer’s Twilight series of teen vampire novels, written explicitly about delaying gratification rather than giving into it, provided the models for the hero and heroine. Perhaps Fifty Shades and its many imitators are not just about sex, or even anticipating sex, at all.\r\n\r\nFrom Austen to Meyer, women’s writing has always reflected women’s insecurities, frustrations and desires within Western society. What does it say about the relatively emancipated women of today when their popular literary figures are made helpless by desire, emotionally or physically? Is it fair to describe the heroines of Fifty Shades or Twilight as passive, when the stories are so clearly all about them and what is in their minds? What does it say about masculinity in our society if women fantasise about invulnerable and dangerous males with impeccable taste and manners, like Christian Grey and Edward Cullen? Or are women reacting to their greater role within society with a yearning to have someone else do all the work for a change?

In his new book, launched at this event, Dr Rupert Sheldrake, one of the world’s most innovative scientists, shows how the sciences are being constricted by assumptions that have hardened into dogmas. Should science be a belief-system, or a realm of enquiry? Sheldrake shows that the “scientific worldview” is moribund. Increasingly expensive research is reaping diminishing returns. In the sceptical spirit of true scientific enquiry, Sheldrake turns the ten fundamental dogmas of science into questions, opening up startling new possibilities. The “laws of nature” may be habits that change and evolve. Minds may extend far beyond brains. The total amount of matter and energy may be increasing. Children may inherit characteristics acquired by their parents. Memories may not be stored as traces in our brains.

Dr Ian Goldin, Director of the 21st Century School at Oxford University will identify the transformational shifts in technology and society and draw out the implications for individuals, business and public policy. Drawing on the wide ranging research currently being undertaken at the 21st Century School, the discourse will go beyond the extrapolation of past trends to consider how the future may differ from our current understanding of progress. \r\n\r\nDr Goldin attributes the extraordinary growth of the past thirty years to the period of unprecedented globalisation and accelerating technological change - but will these trends continue? \r\n\r\nIn the first instance, the discourse will look at population and demographic trends, considering the implications for pensions, retirement, dependency and migration patterns to the year 2050. It will then explore economic trends, considering whether the current dramatic instability in the market is likely to be a short-term deviation from longer term trends. Dr Goldin will also touch on key elements in technological change, focusing on advances in computing, biotechnology, nano-technology and medicine.\r\n\r\nFollowing an examination of the opportunities arising from social and technological change, the discourse turns its focus to risk. Dr Goldin shows that the nature of risk is undergoing fundamental change and that risk analysis requires new frameworks. He considers systemic risks, such as financial systems, pandemics, bio and nuclear terrorism and climate change, as well as the changing nature of more localised risks, due to complexity and integration arising from globalisation. \r\n\r\nOverall, the discourse will draw out the ethical and social implications raised by the major shifts in society and technology. In particular, the bio-ethical issues associated with stem cell, genetic and other medical research. What are the public policy issues associated with the management of the financial crisis and of climate change, as well as the risks posed by pandemics and terrorism?

While the digital divide persists, over 1.3 billion users of the Internet in 2008 and its potential expansion through wireless communication networks make the Internet in the Information Age the equivalent of the electrical grid and the electrical engine in the Industrial Age. However, in spite of ubiquituous presence of the Internet in our everyday life, its understanding as a social process of communication is blurred by myths and ideologies that populate the media. And yet, scholarly research has gathered a substantial amount of evidence, worldwide, in the last decade on the actuality of its effects. This lecture will summarize the main findings of such a body of research, including some conducted by Professor Castells on the specific effects of Internet-mediated communication in the patterns of social life, in business, in education, in public services, in politics, in the media and in culture, and will draw the analytical implications of these findings. Finally, the lecture will explore the reasons for the persistence of myths, be it utopian or dystopian, about the Internet in contrast with the knowledge we now have about its social consequences.\r\n\r\nManuel Castells is the Wallis Annenberg Chair Professor of Communication Technology and Society at the Annenberg School of Communication, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, and Research Professor of Information Society at the Open University of Catalonia, Barcelona. He is as well Distinguished Visiting Professor of Technology and Society at M.I.T., and Distinguished Visiting Professor of Internet Studies at Oxford University.\r\n\r\nThe Space for Thought Lecture series celebrates the completion of the New Academic Building and is supported by the LSE Annual Fund.

A panel of three speakers including scientists, researchers and educators will lead the discussion.", "additional_info": null, "duration": 120, "image_id": null, "added": "2007-06-25T13:25:50", "slug": "f32616a30640919d", "speakers": [{"id": 5657, "name": "Dr Karl James", "slug": "dr-karl-james"}], "topics": [{"id": 743, "name": "education", "path": "/academic/arts/linguistics/education"}, {"id": 317, "name": "creativity", "path": "/science/psychology/creativity"}, {"id": 550, "name": "creativity", "path": "/children/art/creativity"}, {"id": 554, "name": "creativity", "path": "/arts/education/creativity"}], "supercategory": "academic", "venue": {"id": 1032, "name": "Wellcome Trust", "slug": "wellcome-trust", "city": "London", "postcode": "NW1 2BE"}, "organizer": {"id": 1398, "name": "Creative Partnerships", "slug": "creative-partnerships"}, "date": "2007-06-26", "dates": [{"id": 4648, "from_date": "2007-06-26", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "17:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": "The seminar is free, however places are limited, if you would like to attend please email: spacetothink@creative-partnerships.com", "additional_info": null, "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 1032, "name": "Wellcome Trust", "slug": "wellcome-trust", "city": "London", "postcode": "NW1 2BE"}, "organizer": {"id": 1398, "name": "Creative Partnerships", "slug": "creative-partnerships"}}]}, {"id": 4195, "title": "The Ageing Society: challenges, opportunities and unnecessary scares", "synopsis": "Life After Blair public lecture series: Adair Turner will examine the issues of pensions, welfare reform and the challenges posed by an ageing society.", "keywords": "Britain and British politicians ‘after Blair’, Adair Turner pensions, welfare reform, ageing society.", "body": "As part of LSE’s series of lectures looking at the long term challenges facing Britain and British politicians ‘after Blair’, Adair Turner will examine the issues of pensions, welfare reform and the challenges posed by an ageing society. \r\n\r\nAdair Turner was, until recently, chair of the UK Pensions Commission.

Theirs was a lucrative business, particularly as the authorities tended to turn a blind eye.

The aim of this talk is to rescue the concept of unnaturalness as a potential term of critical appraisal in public policy, first by offering an analysis of the concept that differentiates it from terms with which it is commonly confused, and second by using this analysis to provide an account of the potentially legitimate concerns that it might be used to express. \r\nOne of a series of talks organised by the Royal Institute of Philosophy and the Institute of Philosophy and Public Policy, Lancaster University", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": null, "added": "2006-01-03T15:53:15", "slug": "philosophy-public-policy-the-good-the-bad-and-the-unnatural", "speakers": [{"id": 3455, "name": "Professor Alan Holland", "slug": "professor-alan-holland"}], "topics": [{"id": 458, "name": "policy", "path": "/politics/europe/policy"}, {"id": 570, "name": "environment", "path": "/science/environment/environment"}, {"id": 316, "name": "philosophy", "path": "/arts/art/philosophy"}, {"id": 414, "name": "philosophy", "path": "/society/history/philosophy"}], "supercategory": "politics", "venue": {"id": 913, "name": "Gregson Centre", "slug": "gregson-centre", "city": "Lancaster", "postcode": "LA1 3ES"}, "organizer": {"id": 906, "name": "Lancaster University", "slug": "lancaster-university"}, "date": "2006-02-08", "dates": [{"id": 2789, "from_date": "2006-02-08", "to_date": "2006-02-08", "time": "19:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": null, "additional_info": "For further infomation please see www.lancs.ac.uk/fss/ieppp", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 913, "name": "Gregson Centre", "slug": "gregson-centre", "city": "Lancaster", "postcode": "LA1 3ES"}, "organizer": {"id": 906, "name": "Lancaster University", "slug": "lancaster-university"}}]}, {"id": 2605, "title": "Architecture And...The Moving Image", "synopsis": "Architecture And.... is a continuing series featuring outstanding architects and designers offering an insight into the processes behind designing and building private and public spaces.

Plants continued to point the way towards remedies but in the developed world the path always led straight to the lab. However, the last decade has brought renewed interest in using plants in medicine. Bioprospectors go into the wild searching for green gold in the form of healing plants. Fortunately, advances in plant science and medicine enable scientists, like the ones at Kew Gardens, to study the efficacy of plants used traditionally to treat different diseases. But this approach comes with its own economic and ethical dilemmas. Much of the knowledge that goes into bioprospecting comes from indigenous populations. Some of them have successfully offered their plant knowledge in exchange for resources to develop their communities and conserve biodiversity. Since bioprospecting is such a hit-and-miss game, though, many drug companies are reluctant to engage in the search – making plant medicine a fertile but fragile domain.\r\n\r\nGraham Dutfield is Senior Research Fellow at Queen Mary, University of London.
