Newport is well described as a haven of modern Britain with its exotic mix of settlers of Welsh, Irish, English, Italian, Arab and Asian origins, and it is certainly one of the most lively multi-cultural and cosmopolitan cities of the country.\r\nThe town’s allegiance to the British monarchy has had its troubled past. As late as Queen Victoria’s Jubilee of 1897 the residents of Newport were only lurkwarm in their celebrations. However the succession of 20th century Princes of Wales have all found more love and interest created by their actions and high public profiles with more affection shown for them in Wales across religions, creeds and classes. The charismatic Edward, Prince of Wales was widely welcomed in Newport in 1921 when he rode on the town’s famous Transporter Bridge. In 1937 the new King George VI and Queen Elizabeth visited Newport to much praise and public cheering. After the Second World War several members of the Royal family passed through Newport and received a good Welsh welcome.

Hadn't seen as much sunshine as they first made out.\r\nFrom Jeanie’s Director’s statement: “A roller coaster tale of the Nashville music scene in the wake of Elvis Presley’s death, taking in deception, a quest for success, a search for identity and ending in brutal and tragic murder. […] Even if you’ve never heard of Orion, you probably know about the ‘Elvis is Alive’ myth. What I uncovered was that the story of Orion is the story of how that myth got started.”\r\n\r\nThe Great Hip-Hop Hoax\r\nCalifornian hip-hop duo Silibil n' Brains were going to be massive.

Their 1983 ‘Thatchergate’ tape supposedly caught Margret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan discussing Europe becoming the US’s battlefront against the USSR and the sacrifice of HMS Sheffield during the Falklands war.\r\n\r\nThe hoax was a pre-Cassetteboy prank of spliced tape that the CIA thought was by Soviet 'produced to destroy democracy as we know it'. The hoax did not set-off World War Three. \r\n \r\nIn 1981, in the build up to the wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diane, Crass convinced the magazine Loving to carry a free flexi disc of the song Our Wedding. \r\n \r\nEx-Crass Member Penny Rimbaud described the lyrics as “frightful, banal shit about the social fantasy of marriage” that the magazine fell for “hook, line and stinker”. \r\nJoin Penny as he discusses these hoaxes. \r\n\r\nFake Cancer Cures and Anti-Vaccination Myths\r\n\r\nThe news and internet are forever full of fake cancer causes and cure offering simplistic solutions to a complex and terrible illness. The 'alkaline diet' can prevent cancer Sugar can cause cancer. A carbohydrate-free diet can throttle cancer. Homeopathy, cannabis oil and natural remedies can treat cancer. Household electromagnetic radiation causes cancer. \r\nVaccination has been hated and feared since at least 1867 and the formation of the Anti Vaccination League and has had a recent resurgence following the false autism scare of the MMR vaccine. \r\n\r\nWhere is the truth amongst the myth? \r\n \r\nDr David Robert Grimes is a physicist and cancer researcher at Oxford University.

The demand for fair political representation - from the French Revolution to the Treason Trials of 1794.\r\nFrom July 1794 London’s radicals and dissenters once again pressed for fair representation. The hero of Agents of Reason is Jeremiah Joyce who liaised between the reform societies and distributed radical political literature. He operated largely around Red Lion square, Fleet Street and St Paul’s Churchyard. He was working class, a Unitarian and a political radical. He also worked for the Earl of Stanhope and taught William Pitt’s nieces and nephews. By 1794 the system of spies and prosecutions for sedition and treason had stamped out the radical voice and Jeremiah ended up in Newgate.\r\nAgents of Reason is based on the limited remaining archive and accounts a critical moment in the lineage of ‘the left’. John Issitt’s fictionalized account brings to life the personal compromises of a worker for freedom and justice who was used and abused both by circumstances and by his more genteel masters keen not to get their own political hands dirty. In this talk John Issitt will describe his own compromises in negotiating the orthodox register of academic history and the literary license of historical fiction.\r\nJohn Issitt was Provost of Langwith College in the University of York until September 2013. Whilst retaining ‘survival’ teaching hours, he is now a writer and political commentator. Agents of Reason is his second book. He is currently working on Tom and Edmund which spans the 250 years from the childhood experiences of Tom Paine and Edmund Burke to their legacies in the modern world. He uses archival resources but fictionalizes and crosses literary genres to dig deep into the human issues at stake.", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 1955, "added": "2013-08-25T10:20:21", "slug": "4353f9e8d85e9625", "speakers": [{"id": 13927, "name": "John Issitt", "slug": "john-issitt"}], "topics": [{"id": 2692, "name": "history", "path": "/arts/finearts/film/film/history"}, {"id": 3459, "name": "radical", "path": "/politics/radical"}, {"id": 80, "name": "society", "path": "/society"}, {"id": 61, "name": "politics", "path": "/politics"}, {"id": 2038, "name": "radicalisation", "path": "/politics/radicalisation"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 704, "name": "Conway Hall", "slug": "conway-hall", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC1R 4RL"}, "organizer": {"id": 704, "name": "Conway Hall", "slug": "conway-hall"}, "date": "2013-10-06", "dates": [{"id": 13259, "from_date": "2013-10-06", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "11:00:00", "ticket_cost": "£5", "ticket_info": "http://www.conwayhall.org.uk/john-issitt", "additional_info": "Complimentary Tea and coffee will be available.\r\n", "members_only": "No", "members_info": "Members of Conway Hall Ethical Society gain free entry to all Sunday Lectures.\r\nhttp://www.conwayhall.org.uk/ethical-society", "venue": {"id": 704, "name": "Conway Hall", "slug": "conway-hall", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC1R 4RL"}, "organizer": {"id": 704, "name": "Conway Hall", "slug": "conway-hall"}}]}, {"id": 12763, "title": "Not Just Constable & Turner; A History of Landscape Art", "synopsis": "lecture with Adrian Sumner", "keywords": "English Landscape Painting, Art", "body": "The history of landscape painting is a reflection of our views of nature.

The technical brilliance of his graphic work had made a big impact in Italy, yet his paintings were said to lack such qualities as the deep, rich colour for which Venetian art was renowned. Dürer was determined to ‘stop the mouths’ of his critics before returning to effect a revolution, a ‘renaissance’ in the arts in Germany.

Matthew Fox is author of 29 books that have been translated into 43 languages \r\n\r\nSeeking to establish a new pedagogy for learning spirituality that was grounded in an effort to reawaken the West to its own mystical traditions in such figures as Hildegard of Bingen, Meister Eckhart and the mysticism of Thomas Aquinas, as well as interacting with contemporary scientists who are also mystics, Fox founded the Institute in Culture and Creation Spirituality \r\n\r\nFor ten of those years at Holy Names College Cardinal Ratzinger, as chief Inquisitor and head of the Congregation of Doctrine and Faith (called the Office of the Holy Inquisition until 1965), tried to shut the program down. Ratzinger silenced Fox for one year in 1988 and forced him to step down as director. Three years later he expelled Fox from the Order thus terminating the program at Holy Names College.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, when Cardinal Ratzinger was made pope, Fox went to Martin Luther’s church in Wittenburg , Germany and pounded 95 contemporary theses at the door to call people to a New Reformation.   Knowing Ratzinger well from a protracted battle with him over the years in his role as chief inquisitor of our day, he wanted to alert people to what the future held.  That future has very much arrived.\r\n\r\nFox believes that by “reinventing work, education and worship we can bring about a non-violent revolution on our planet” and has committed himself to this vision for many years.\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 120, "image_id": null, "added": "2012-03-07T14:53:15", "slug": "1dad973d2ea2d72b", "speakers": [{"id": 7822, "name": "Rev Dr Matthew Fox", "slug": "rev-dr-matthew-fox"}], "topics": [{"id": 1523, "name": "mystical", "path": "/arts/poetry/mystical"}, {"id": 1526, "name": "mystical", "path": "/religion/faith/mystical"}, {"id": 366, "name": "theology", "path": "/arts/philosophy/theology"}, {"id": 1862, "name": "theology", "path": "/religion/judaism/theology"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 2638, "name": "The Window", "slug": "the-window", "city": "London", "postcode": "N1 8QG"}, "organizer": {"id": 405, "name": "Scientific and Medical Network", "slug": "scientific-and-medical-network"}, "date": "2012-04-04", "dates": [{"id": 11313, "from_date": "2012-04-04", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "19:30:00", "ticket_cost": "£15.00", "ticket_info": "Scientific and Medical Network\r\nPO Box 11\r\nMoreton in Marsh, Gloucestershire GL56 0BY\r\nEmail: info@scimednet.org\r\nWebsite: www.scimednet.org", "additional_info": "Dinner will be available afterwards for an additional fee", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 2638, "name": "The Window", "slug": "the-window", "city": "London", "postcode": "N1 8QG"}, "organizer": {"id": 405, "name": "Scientific and Medical Network", "slug": "scientific-and-medical-network"}}]}, {"id": 10828, "title": "Nine years on is the UN still failing Darfur?", "synopsis": "Join us at the Frontline Club to discuss the actions of the UN and whether they are still failing Darfur.", "keywords": "Darfur, Chad, Frontline club, debate, talk, genocide, UN, Sudan", "body": "Since the start of the 2003 genocide in Darfur, questions have been raised about the role played by the United Nations and the viability of its mandate.

This talk rethinks the idea of ‘Christian Europe’, and lays to rest many of the myths and misconceptions about the Christian tradition, from the idea of Original Sin to the impact of the Reformation. It suggests that the history of Christianity, its relationship to other ethical traditions, and the relationship between Christian values and those of modern, liberal, secular societies is far more complex than is often realized. Christianity is only one of many sources of modern European culture, and many of what we now think of as bedrock values were in fact borrowed from non-Christian cultures and traditions. The erosion of Christianity will not necessarily lead to the erosion of liberal democratic values.

The vulva is threshold of internal and external, it is made up of more than one organ – clitoris, labia majora and minora, vagina, cervix, and the general perineal area – a pineal perinaeum if you like. The vulva is a conceptual gate, just like the gates through which we enter into unnatural worlds and interkingdom, interworld and interspirit alliances in enochian sex magick and necronomic chaos magick. Through ritual we can become vulvas – paradigmatically and conceptually. We can think and act like vulvas.\r\n\r\nLike, and through chaos magick, becoming vulva is involuted and undone, creating a larval sexuality – immature and transformed at every synthesis, which acts not toward a thing but toward its metamorphosis, toward perceiving itself which cannot be perceived, toward the imperceptibility within repetition where all elements within syntheses are dissipated, disoriented and reoriented with each turn, each folding and each alteration in the aspects of involution.

For example, the mineral Lapis Lazuli was used as pigment by the Ancient Egyptians, being the bright blue colouration on Tutankhamen’s mask. In more recent times, synthetic zeolites have been applied as catalysts for the cracking of crude oil into petrol, as water softeners in detergents and to entomb the Chernobyl nuclear reactor. But even after 100 years of research, these materials continue to amaze us. For example, recently they have been found to expand when squeezed and contract on heating!

If further research shows that this virus causes cancer, the possibility of a preventative vaccine would be of enormous consequence. Breast cancer is the most common cancer of Australian women, affecting one in 11 women. While many risk factors have been identified, no clear cause of breast cancer has been defined. Many people believe that breast cancer is purely a hereditary disease, yet hereditary breast cancer has been estimated to account for only 5%of all cases. In recent years many other cancers have been linked to viruses, most notably cervical cancer and human papilloma virus. The research team in Australia think that breast cancer may be caused by a combination of hormonal, genetic and environmental factors. The research has focused on the role of one environmental agent, a virus termed HHMMTV, as a possible cause of breast cancer.\r\n\r\nThis event is in association with the British Council (Australia).\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 120, "added": "2004-08-04T09:18:06", "slug": "d883812921e0c50f", "speakers": [{"id": 1354, "name": "Caroline Ford", "slug": "caroline-ford"}], "topics": [{"id": 329, "name": "cancer", "path": "/science/medicine/cancer"}, {"id": 162, "name": "research", "path": "/science/research"}, {"id": 299, "name": "health", "path": "/academic/health"}, {"id": 300, "name": "health", "path": "/politics/health"}], "supercategory": "science", "venue": {"id": 2, "name": "The Royal Institution of Great Britain", "slug": "the-royal-institution-of-great-britain", "city": "London", "postcode": "W1S 4BS"}, "organizer": {"id": 2, "name": "The Royal Institution of Great Britain", "slug": "the-royal-institution-of-great-britain"}, "date": "2004-09-14", "dates": [{"id": 1163, "from_date": "2004-09-14", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "19:00:00", "ticket_cost": "£5, but free to Members of the Royal Institution", "ticket_info": "www.rigb.org\r\n020 7409 2992", "additional_info": "Nearest tube: Green Park", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 2, "name": "The Royal Institution of Great Britain", "slug": "the-royal-institution-of-great-britain", "city": "London", "postcode": "W1S 4BS"}, "organizer": {"id": 2, "name": "The Royal Institution of Great Britain", "slug": "the-royal-institution-of-great-britain"}}]}, {"id": 1073, "title": "Concrete Prehistoric Monsters: Richard Owen’s Crystal Palace Models", "synopsis": "Richard Owen oversaw the construction of the first ever full-size dinosaur models, and when they went on display in 1854, Victorian Britain was struck with the first ever outbreak of ’dinomania’.
