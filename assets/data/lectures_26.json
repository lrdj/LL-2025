Around 150 million Muslims between North Africa and Southeast Asia lived under British and French imperial rule, and more than 20 million were governed by Moscow. Many people today are unaware, however, of the extent of Nazi efforts to secure Muslim support, or that Muslims fought in the Nazi army.\r\n\r\nFrom 1941 onward, the Wehrmacht and the SS recruited thousands of Muslim soldiers, organized in formations such as the Wehrmacht’s Muslim Eastern Legions and Islamic SS divisions in the Balkans. At the height of the war, all major Axis and Allied powers began to view Islam as politically and strategically important. In Islam and Nazi Germany’s War, David Motadel reveals that it was at this time, in 1941-1942, that Nazi officials began to enthusiastically promote an alliance with the Muslim world against their presumed common enemies—the British Empire, the Soviet Union, and the Jews. Drawing on archival sources from across three continents, Motadel presents the first comprehensive account of Germany’s remarkable attempts to build an alliance with the Islamic world during World War II. Interweaving religious, political, and military history, Motadel provides a new understanding of the politics of religion in the bloodiest conflict of the twentieth century.\r\n\r\nDavid Motadel is Research Fellow in History at Gonville and Caius College, University of Cambridge.\r\n\r\nThis event has been organised in partnership with Harvard University Press, publishers of Islam and Nazi Germany's War (November 2014).

The coming of the Royal Army Hospital on undeveloped land was to have a big impact in developing Chelsea as an area of elegant residences. This was further stimulated by the Ranelagh Pleasure Gardens in the 18th century. The southern end of Chelsea retained an atmosphere of elegance, helped by the Chelsea Physic Garden. In what had been a village of grand houses since Tudor times where Sir Thomas More was highly significant, industry developed with the Chelsea Porcelain works and the Waterworks which provided fresh water for Mayfair and Belgravia. The river area in the 19th century became an artistic quarter with Whistler, Rosetti and the pre-Raphaelites making their presence.

The programme came out of a case study of Gurpreet Bhatti’s play ‘Behud’ which was her imaginative response to the experience of her previous play Behzti being cancelled by Birmingham Rep when hostile demonstrations against the play outside the theatre turned violent. The themes that arose from this focussed on the kind of support an artist needs to present challenging, potentially divisive work – the artist is not operating in a vacuum, but requires producers and venues to be willing to take risks too.Central to this programme is ‘Taking the Offensive’ a major conference, hosted by Jude Kelly at the South Bank with key note speech by Nicholas Serota that she organised last year to open up dialogue about the dilemmas and opportunities generated by controversies in the arts. Julia’s talk will look at the impact of gatekeepers, the police, the audience, media, public opinion and arts educators on what is sayable in the public realm and in particular the nature of self-censorship that is pervasive in the arts scene today.\r\n\r\nFor further information, click here - http://www.independentdance.co.uk/programmepage/exchanges/crossing-borders/\r\n\r\nTickets:\r\nSingle talk £6 | £4 freelance and concession\r\n3-talk cards £16.50 | £10.50 freelance and concession\r\n\r\nDrinks Offer: Free drinks voucher for the first 20 people who book for any talk \r\n\r\nTo book, please call 020 7091 9650 or email info@independentdance.co.uk\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 1768, "added": "2014-11-11T11:07:40", "slug": "b738d7a2003dbada", "speakers": [{"id": 15220, "name": "Julia Farrington ", "slug": "julia-farrington"}], "topics": [{"id": 2676, "name": "dance", "path": "/arts/arts/education/dance"}, {"id": 1869, "name": "performance", "path": "/arts/film/videoart/performance"}, {"id": 3399, "name": "performance", "path": "/arts/art/contemporaryart/performance"}, {"id": 1018, "name": "talk", "path": "/arts/education/debate/talk"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 1781, "name": "Independent Dance", "slug": "independent-dance", "city": "London", "postcode": "SE1 6ER"}, "organizer": {"id": 1781, "name": "Independent Dance", "slug": "independent-dance"}, "date": "2014-11-11", "dates": [{"id": 14811, "from_date": "2014-11-11", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "19:00:00", "ticket_cost": "£4-£6", "ticket_info": "Please call Siobhan Davies reception on 020 7091 9650 or email info@independentdance.co.uk.", "additional_info": null, "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 1781, "name": "Independent Dance", "slug": "independent-dance", "city": "London", "postcode": "SE1 6ER"}, "organizer": {"id": 1781, "name": "Independent Dance", "slug": "independent-dance"}}]}, {"id": 14134, "title": "Exhibition Tour", "synopsis": "Don’t miss the chance to join our exhibiting artist Nadia Kaabi-Linke for a special tour of her first UK solo exhibition, The Future Rewound & The Cabinet of Souls.", "keywords": "Tour, exhibition, mixed-media, installation, history", "body": "Visitors will have the opportunity to tour the exhibition with the artist providing an in depth guide to the works featured in the show, which includes recent as well as new site-specific installations inspired by the history of the building.

It does not mean owning a child, to treat as a chattel and do with as you wish to. Therefore, every child has a right to a free mind and a broad and thorough education void of proselytising.\r\nGood social morals and a sense of empathy and personal self control can be imparted to children within the realms of this reality, in an all encompassing secular manner. Particularly with the use of such techniques as: role play situations with their peers; question and answer sessions; and group discussions on such issues.\r\nPresenting culture as an argument to defend the status quo with regard to the current system of using religion as the conduit with which to explain good social morals to our children - via the school curriculum - is a flawed argument and a nonsensical suggestion.\r\nThe main driver and agent in stifling this progress is ‘Organised Religion’ and its untenable influence within government and education. The irony in this respect is that society today seems quite happy to continue to pretend that the base claims of organised religion - particularly Christianity in the Western World - are tangible. \r\nIt is time to have the courage to break the seal around this protected story, and reveal the real events of history which put ‘Organised Religion’ – Christianity in particular – into this self appointed position of ‘arbiters of the unquestionable truth’.\r\nMichael Lawrence was brought up in a non-religious family and as such has always been secular, but with a particular personal interest and fascination in mythology & theology. He sees no real difference between the two, save one is past defunct beliefs and the other presently held beliefs. Michael has never considered the religious stories to be anything but stories; despite a fervently religious presence within the schools he attended.\r\nMichael joined the British Army at 16, straight from School, and his first posting after one year’s training was in Belfast, where he witnessed firsthand real and ardent religiously based sectarianism, but had no understanding at the time, as to why this sectarianism existed.

The answer is that all of them have genetic errors in a particular kind of protein, known as an ion channel, that regulates the electrical activity of the body. Humans are electrical machines and your ability to read this page and to understand its message, to laugh and cry, to see and hear, and to move your limbs, is due to the electrical events taking place in the nerve cells in your brain and the muscle cells in your limbs. And that electrical activity is initiated and regulated by your ion channels. These little-known proteins are essential for every aspect of our lives, from consciousness to fighting infection, from sexual attraction to the beating of our hearts. They are also used as weapons of warfare by the immune system and by bacteria. It is therefore not surprising that a multitude of medicinal drugs work by regulating the activity of ion channels, and that impaired ion channel function is responsible for many human and animal diseases. This lecture charts the development of our understanding of animal electricity, explains how it is generated by ion channels, and discusses the ways that ion channels regulates our lives and the dramatic consequences when things go wrong. In brief, its aim is to 'sing the body electric'.", "additional_info": null, "duration": 60, "image_id": null, "added": "2012-05-29T14:10:46", "slug": "the-spark-of-life", "speakers": [{"id": 3810, "name": "Prof Frances Ashcroft", "slug": "prof-frances-ashcroft"}], "topics": [{"id": 3006, "name": "ions", "path": "/science/physiology/ions"}], "supercategory": "science", "venue": {"id": 44, "name": "The Royal Society", "slug": "the-royal-society", "city": "London", "postcode": "SW1Y 5AG"}, "organizer": {"id": 44, "name": "The Royal Society", "slug": "the-royal-society"}, "date": "2012-06-19", "dates": [{"id": 11600, "from_date": "2012-06-19", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "18:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": null, "additional_info": null, "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 44, "name": "The Royal Society", "slug": "the-royal-society", "city": "London", "postcode": "SW1Y 5AG"}, "organizer": {"id": 44, "name": "The Royal Society", "slug": "the-royal-society"}}]}, {"id": 11070, "title": "Land and the Political Economy of Development in India since Liberalisation", "synopsis": "Department of Anthropology public lecture", "keywords": "anthropology, land, development, politics, economic anthropology, political anthropology, local", "body": "Akhil Gupta is professor of anthropology and director of the Center for India and South Asia at UCLA. \r\n\r\nSuggested hashtag for this event for Twitter users: #lsegupta", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 732, "added": "2012-04-26T17:23:31", "slug": "4b122e0be5d26ace", "speakers": [{"id": 12318, "name": "Professor Akhil Gupta", "slug": "professor-akhil-gupta"}], "topics": [{"id": 2896, "name": "india", "path": "/academic/anthropology/india"}, {"id": 2933, "name": "development", "path": "/academic/anthropology/development"}, {"id": 2934, "name": "anthropology", "path": "/society/india/anthropology"}, {"id": 2935, "name": "india", "path": "/society/development/india"}, {"id": 2936, "name": "anthropology", "path": "/society/development/anthropology"}], "supercategory": "academic", "venue": {"id": 1515, "name": "Old Theatre, Old Building", "slug": "old-theatre-old-building", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC2A 2AE"}, "organizer": {"id": 1287, "name": "London School of Economics & Political Science", "slug": "london-school-of-economics-political-science"}, "date": "2012-06-11", "dates": [{"id": 11506, "from_date": "2012-06-11", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "18:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": "This event is free and open to all with no ticket required.

The lectures are challenging and interactive.  Audience members are asked to raise their hands in response to a series of questions about their attitudes to a political issue of the day.

So begins an hour in which political controversies are examined with regard to the underlying philosophical issues. \r\n\r\nAn antidote to the \"yah-boo\" debate of party politics, Sandel's lectures will be profound as well as entertaining. \r\n\r\nThe three lectures will take place on 5.45pm and 7.45pm on Thursday March 8 and at 6.30pm on Friday March 9. Each event is ticketed, so you need to submit a ticket request for each of the lectures. \r\n\r\nTopics will be decided close to recording, but each of the three events will examine a different issue. \r\n\r\nThe lectures will be broadcast as The Public Philosopher on BBC Radio 4 at 9am on Tuesday 3, 10 and 17 April 2012. \r\n\r\nMichael Sandel is Professor of Government and lecturer in political philosophy at\r\nHarvard.

In January 2011 he hosted a discussion for\r\nBBC Four at the Royal Institution on fairness in public policy and the Big Society.

This lens includes not only people with disability, but also the enormous generation of post-WWII Baby Boomers who are beginning to sense the health care crisis that is looming as they deal with their own aging and increasingly infirm parents. \r\n\r\nDonna Thomson, born and educated in Montreal, began her career as an actor, director and teacher. But in 1988, when her son Nicholas was born with severe disabilities, Donna embarked on her second career as a disability activist. A veteran of numerous committees promoting the inclusion of her son, Donna became interested in how families, communities and governments can work together to find new ways of supporting our most vulnerable citizens. When she moved to London in 2006 with her husband (James Wright, Canadian High Commissioner to the UK), Donna became interested in the ways in which innovation within the development sector could inform policymaking for disability in Canada and the UK. The Four Walls of My Freedom is the result of three years of research into how the work of Amartya Sen, Martha Nussbaum and other economist/philosophers can shape our thinking about distributive justice for those who give or receive care. \r\n\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 732, "added": "2011-01-19T11:00:19", "slug": "c7205680527df52b", "speakers": [{"id": 10683, "name": "Donna Thomson", "slug": "donna-thomson"}, {"id": 5619, "name": "Chair: Professor  Stuart Corbridge", "slug": "chair-professor-stuart-corbridge"}], "topics": [{"id": 1822, "name": "philosophy", "path": "/academic/religion/religion/philosophy"}, {"id": 2388, "name": "philosophy", "path": "/arts/literature/philosophy/philosophy"}, {"id": 316, "name": "philosophy", "path": "/arts/art/philosophy"}, {"id": 414, "name": "philosophy", "path": "/society/history/philosophy"}], "supercategory": "academic", "venue": {"id": 2223, "name": "Wolfson Theatre", "slug": "wolfson-theatre", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC2A 2AE"}, "organizer": {"id": 1287, "name": "London School of Economics & Political Science", "slug": "london-school-of-economics-political-science"}, "date": "2011-02-19", "dates": [{"id": 9670, "from_date": "2011-02-19", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "1 day, 0:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": "All events in the Literary Festival programme are free and open to all, but a ticket is required.

A lecture by Prof. Lorraine Culley of De Montfort University", "keywords": "Globalisation, babies, reproduction, fertility", "body": "Over 40 million women worldwide experience infertility. Many can now be helped to have a child through a range of assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs), some of which give rise to new, and for some unsettling, family forms. A child may have 3 ‘mothers’; a grandmother may conceive her own grandchild; a 67 year old can give birth to twins.  Increasingly, ARTs are practised in a global context and this elicits passionate debates about ‘fertility tourists’, ‘designer babies’ and ‘wombs for rent.’ Drawing on the latest project in a body of work exploring the experiences and perceptions of infertility and assisted conception, this lecture examines the genesis and extent of ‘transnational reproduction’, and discusses some of the experiences of those most intimately involved in it: the global consumers of the commerce of conception. \r\n\r\n\r\nLorraine Culley is Professor of Social Science and Health at DMU, and a graduate of the Universities of Liverpool (BA, PhD) and London (MA).

Local communities may readily sell logging rights to timber companies to fund elusive ‘development’.  Alternatively, landowners may hold the key to forest conservation.  It may be possible, if they have some notion of managing forest resources, to build on these practices.  But according to some commentators they traditionally lack a conservation ethic.  In order to advise on forest policy, it is necessary to try and gauge the practices, attitudes and ideas of local people.  This accords with current participatory development approaches to consult ‘grassroots’ opinion, as in indigenous knowledge (IK) research, which aims to facilitate interventions by promoting partnership and an awareness of local perspectives.  It is indisputable that local people will be well qualified to define problems, and will be ‘experts’ on their forests.  Regarding some problems, global Western knowledge may be irrelevant, and could even worsen make matters by overlooking aspects of the local system.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties encountered in formulating generalisations applicable on a large scale present a barrier to IK informing policy, as in the management of logging and promotion of forest conservation.  The short-termism of development, politically driven for immediate returns, presents further problems.  We need to evolve methods and formulate principles that will allow some reliable local inputs into policy debates.  One way to assess local knowledge and aspirations quickly on a nation-wide level is to use surveys.  This lecture discusses a rural community survey conducted in PNG to ascertain peoples’ attitudes to forestry, logging and conservation, and inform policy debates.  But a survey is a relatively blunt instrument for assessing the subtleties of IK, having well rehearsed drawbacks.  It also glosses over contentious political issues.  But what more effective way is there of assessing understanding and ideas widely at the grass-roots in a short time frame?", "additional_info": null, "duration": 60, "image_id": 461, "added": "2007-09-20T15:14:49", "slug": "local-perceptions-and-forest-policy-conservation-and-logging-in-papua-new-guinea", "speakers": [{"id": 5913, "name": "Professor Paul Sillitoe", "slug": "professor-paul-sillitoe"}], "topics": [{"id": 159, "name": "biodiversity", "path": "/science/biology/biodiversity"}, {"id": 752, "name": "conservation", "path": "/science/naturalhistory/conservation"}, {"id": 924, "name": "conservation", "path": "/academic/naturalhistory/conservation"}, {"id": 1002, "name": "conservation", "path": "/leisure/conservation/conservation"}, {"id": 1331, "name": "papuanewguinea", "path": "/academic/anthropology/southeastasia/papuanewguinea"}], "supercategory": "science", "venue": {"id": 1247, "name": "Jodrell Lecture Theatre", "slug": "jodrell-lecture-theatre", "city": "Richmond", "postcode": "TW9 3DS"}, "organizer": {"id": 802, "name": "Centre for Economic Botany", "slug": "centre-for-economic-botany"}, "date": "2007-10-09", "dates": [{"id": 4868, "from_date": "2007-10-09", "to_date": "2007-10-09", "time": "17:00:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": null, "additional_info": "No tickets required; lecture theatre holds 200.
