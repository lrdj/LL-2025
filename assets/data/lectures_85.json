As he moved through Europe, he spied his biggest mark on the Riviera: a prodigiously rich Hungarian countess, who was instantly smitten with the con man. \r\n\r\nThe countess bankrolled a lavish trip through Italy that made Laplante a darling of the Mussolini regime and a worldwide celebrity, soaring to unimaginable heights on the wings of his lies.

A founder-member of the Committed Generation of Poets and a member of the Salvadorean Communist Party, Dalton was imprisoned in 1959 and sentenced to death for organising students and peasants against the local landowners. On the day of his execution his life was saved when the military dictatorship was overthrown in a coup. Dalton escaped death a second time in 1965 when the prison was hit by an earthquake.\r\n\r\nHe spent several years in exile in Mexico, Cuba and Czechoslovakia, publishing poetry, essays, fiction and biography and winning the 1969 Casa de las Américas poetry prize. In 1975 Dalton returned to El Salvador and joined the underground Ejército Revolucionario del Pueblo (the Revolutionary Army of the People). Accused by the ERP of being a CIA spy, Dalton was murdered four days before his fortieth birthday.\r\n\r\nAbout the Translators and Editors \r\n\r\nJohn Green was a documentary film maker for twenty years, covering social and political issues throughout the world for GDR television. His books include Engels: A Revolutionary Life, Ken Sprague: People’s Artist, Red Reporter and (with Bruni de la Motte) Stasi Hell or Workers’ Paradise: Socialism in the German Democratic Republic. Many of his translations included in His Hands Were Gentle: Selected Lyrics of Victor Jara (also published by Smokestack).\r\n\r\nMichal Boncza was born in the UK, spent his childhood in Argentina and his youth in Poland where he studied architecture. He is a journalist, graphic designer and translator, specialising in translations from the Spanish. He currently works at the Morning Star newspaper.

Unmade Film is an expansive collection of audio-visual works that point to the structure of a film but never fully become one. Unmade Film takes as its starting point the mental hospital Kfar Sha’ul in Jerusalem. Initially specialising in the treatment of Holocaust survivors – including a relative of the artist – it was established in 1951 using the remains of the Palestinian village Deir Yassin that had been depopulated in a massacre by Zionist paramilitaries in April 1948. Unmade Film was developed over a two-year period of research and production between 2011 and 2013. The work and its different elements evolved out of exchanges and collaborations with psychologists, psychiatric nurses, historians, musicians, pupils, amateur actors, curators, artists and others.\r\n\r\nUriel Orlow will present his lecture performance Unmade Film: The Proposal. In this last work of Unmade Film, the artist returns to the very beginning of the project, looking backward and forward at the same time. As a film proposal, it connects his own family history, the village of Deir Yassin, questions around narrative structures and the eventual impossibility of making this film. The live format combines story telling, autobiography, and interrogation with the act of witnessing on the part of the audience.\r\n\r\nThe lecture performance will be followed by the launch of the publication on Unmade Film. An on-going dialogue between Andrea Thal and Uriel Orlow led to the development of a publication in parallel to the making of the work. Three modular and expanding editions have preceded and culminate in this publication, each accompanying exhibitions of Unmade Film at Al-Ma’mal Foundation for Contemporary Art Jerusalem, CCS Paris and Les Complices* Zurich, respectively. The publications includes texts by Erik Bullot, Yoa’d Ghanadry, Avery Gordon, Esmail Nashif, Ilan Pappé, Hanan Toukan, Andrea Thal und Uriel Orlow.\r\n\r\nFind out more here: www.mosaicrooms.org/unmade-film-the-proposal/\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 60, "image_id": null, "added": "2014-04-14T14:58:34", "slug": "c1afb45c22f69fbd", "speakers": [{"id": 14637, "name": "Uriel Orlow  Orlow ", "slug": "uriel-orlow-orlow"}], "topics": [{"id": 2693, "name": "film", "path": "/arts/finearts/film/film/film"}, {"id": 925, "name": "lecture", "path": "/arts/music/classical/lecture"}, {"id": 2675, "name": "lecture", "path": "/arts/arts/education/lecture"}, {"id": 2678, "name": "lecture", "path": "/arts/art/arthistory/lecture"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 2279, "name": "The Mosaic Rooms", "slug": "the-mosaic-rooms", "city": "London", "postcode": "SW5 0SW"}, "organizer": {"id": 2279, "name": "The Mosaic Rooms", "slug": "the-mosaic-rooms"}, "date": "2014-04-24", "dates": [{"id": 14124, "from_date": "2014-04-24", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "19:00:00", "ticket_cost": "FREE", "ticket_info": null, "additional_info": null, "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 2279, "name": "The Mosaic Rooms", "slug": "the-mosaic-rooms", "city": "London", "postcode": "SW5 0SW"}, "organizer": {"id": 2279, "name": "The Mosaic Rooms", "slug": "the-mosaic-rooms"}}]}, {"id": 13583, "title": "“Marks Hard To Erase”: The Rescue and Repatriation of “Absorbed” Armenian Women Survivors, 1919-1927", "synopsis": "A lecture on the women of the 1915 Armenian Genocide", "keywords": "Holocaust, history, refugees, university, genocide, Armenian, Armenia, ww1", "body": "During the Armenian genocide of 1915, many thousands of women and children were kidnapped or sold from the deportation columns into Turkish, Kurdish, or Arab households, where they lived as wives, servants, or concubines. After the Armistice, various humanitarian organisations, including the American charity Near East Relief and the League of Nations, set about reclaiming these Christian women and children from Moslem homes as part of the relief work, and reintegrating them into the Armenian community. A very specific group within these survivors were women whose faces and hands had been tattooed according to Bedouin custom, a rite of passage which also denoted tribal and familial possession. Unlike the children, who were more easily reabsorbed into the community (and a staple of philanthropic giving), these women bore on their skin visible, permanent reminders of their ‘defilement’ by non-Christian men, which was of course a major taboo among Armenians and a source of much horror for Americans and Europeans. This paper focuses on the reactions and responses of the relief workers to those who had been tattooed, and how their experiences were articulated in the relief fundraising campaigns ‘back home’ – both discursively and in photographs. The plight of these women goes to the heart of the rescuers’ dilemma: on the one hand they wanted to restore them to the Armenian ‘nation’, but on the other, what was seen as their visible contamination made that a problematic and perhaps impossible goal. \r\n\r\nThis presentation will be given by Dr Rebecca Jinks, who recently completed her PhD at Royal Holloway, University of London.

Throughout her life (1869-1940) and work Goldman centred sexuality as both key to how capitalism functions (particularly for women) and as a privileged site for political transformation. Connecting sexuality to labour, Goldman's analyses of reproduction, prostitution, homosexuality and free love provide a helpful challenge to contemporary feminist investments in materialist and cultural analyses as opposed, and open up the possibility of an alternative feminist history with sexual materialism at its heart. But in claiming Goldman's thinking for a post-Marxist queer and feminist politics, what do we need to ignore in her thought? What does serious consideration of the sexual (but not gendered) essentialism that grounds Goldman's thought do to a contemporary vision of feminist transformation? Drawing on primary materials and a creative re-reading of archival fragments, I suggest that Goldman's sexual politics allows for a reinvigorated feminist method (as well as politics) with a real connection to others at its heart. \r\n\r\nClare Hemmings is Professor of Feminist Theory and has been working at LSE for 13 years.

Despite having in common a \"military-industrial complex\", they were profoundly different in the degree of freedom they offered their citizens, the living standards they were able to achieve and the pace of technological innovation they could sustain. In this first lecture, Niall Ferguson compares and contrasts the United States and the Soviet Union in the Cold War and asks how far the outcome of the Cold War was economically determined from the outset. In particular, what role did commercial and financial globalisation play in enhancing U.S. power in the world? And how serious a threat did inflation pose to the United States in the 1970s? \r\n\r\nProfessor Niall Ferguson is the Philippe Roman Chair in History and International Affairs for the 2010-2011 academic year. \r\n\r\nBorn in Glasgow in 1964, he was a Demy at Magdalen College and graduated with First Class Honours in 1985. After two years as a Hanseatic Scholar in Hamburg and Berlin, he took up a Research Fellowship at Christ's College, Cambridge, in 1989, subsequently moving to a Lectureship at Peterhouse. He returned to Oxford in 1992 to become Fellow and Tutor in Modern History at Jesus College, a post he held until 2000, when he was appointed Professor of Political and Financial History at Oxford. Two years later he left for the United States to take up the Herzog Chair in Financial History at the Stern Business School, New York University, before moving to Harvard in 2004. \r\n\r\nHe is a regular contributor to television and radio on both sides of the Atlantic. In 2003 he wrote and presented a six-part history of the British Empire for Channel 4. The accompanying book, Empire: The Rise and Demise of the British World Order and the Lessons for Global Power (Basic), was a bestseller in both Britain and the United States. The sequel, Colossus: The Rise and Fall of the American Empire, was published in 2004 by Penguin. Two years later he published The War of the World: Twentieth Century Conflict and the Descent of the West, which was also a PBS series. His most recent books are the best-selling Ascent of Money: A Financial History of the World and High Financier: The Lives and Time of Siegmund Warburg. He is now working on the life of Henry Kissinger.\r\n\r\nA prolific commentator on contemporary politics and economics, Niall Ferguson writes and reviews regularly for the British and American press. He is a contributing editor for the Financial Times and a regular contributor to Newsweek. In 2004 Time magazine named him as one of the world's hundred most influential people. \r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 732, "added": "2010-09-14T20:35:25", "slug": "the-political-economy-of-the-cold-war", "speakers": [{"id": 991, "name": "Professor Niall Ferguson", "slug": "professor-niall-ferguson"}, {"id": 5505, "name": "Professor Arne Westad", "slug": "professor-arne-westad"}], "topics": [{"id": 2250, "name": "globalisation", "path": "/academic/globalisation/globalisation"}, {"id": 2251, "name": "economy", "path": "/academic/history/usa/coldwar/economy"}], "supercategory": "academic", "venue": {"id": 2131, "name": "Old Theatre", "slug": "old-theatre", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC2A 2AE"}, "organizer": {"id": 1287, "name": "London School of Economics & Political Science", "slug": "london-school-of-economics-political-science"}, "date": "2010-10-18", "dates": [{"id": 9224, "from_date": "2010-10-18", "to_date": "2010-10-18", "time": "18:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": "This event is free and open to all however a ticket is required.

Two years on much work is in hand to reform global financial regulation, but it is not clear that the crisis will produce change as radical as initially supposed. Adair Turner will argue, however, that the crisis should provoke us to think deeply about the conventional wisdom of the last several decades in which economic growth maximisation is the clear objective of economic policy, and market liberalisation, including in financial markets, the universally applicable means. Against this instrumental justification of markets and resulting inequality, Adair Turner will advance a case for economic freedom as an end in itself but one which needs to be balanced with other desirable ends. This implies the need for the discipline of economics to consider a wide range of behavioural, historical and philosophical issues, eschewing a narrow focus on mathematical precision. Lord Turner will contrast his conclusions with those Lionel Robbins reached in his famous 1932 \"Essay on the Nature and Significance of Economic Science\". \r\n\r\nAdair Turner is chairman of the Financial Services Authority, the Climate Change Committee and the Overseas Development Institute. He is also chair of the Working Party of the G20 Financial Stability Board reporting to the G20 Summit in November 2010 and a visiting professor at LSE. \r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 732, "added": "2010-09-13T10:00:30", "slug": "4d56f6f6eb9ba5ff", "speakers": [{"id": 10219, "name": "Chair: Lord Turner", "slug": "chair-lord-turner"}], "topics": [{"id": 1239, "name": "economics", "path": "/politics/economics/latinamerica/economics"}, {"id": 1740, "name": "markets", "path": "/politics/globalisation/markets"}, {"id": 415, "name": "economics", "path": "/society/politics/economics"}, {"id": 92, "name": "economics", "path": "/academic/economics"}], "supercategory": "politics", "venue": {"id": 2131, "name": "Old Theatre", "slug": "old-theatre", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC2A 2AE"}, "organizer": {"id": 1287, "name": "London School of Economics & Political Science", "slug": "london-school-of-economics-political-science"}, "date": "2010-10-12", "dates": [{"id": 9209, "from_date": "2010-10-12", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "18:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": "This event is free and open to all with no ticket required.

It is an entirely fresh - and at times controversial - look at Mao in both content and approach.\r\n\r\n\r\nJung Chang was born in Yibin, Sichuan Province, China, in 1952.

The central questions are; to what extent do smugglers give direction to migration and how much autonomy do migrants have in deciding where they want to travel? The common assumption is that smuggled migrants are recruited by criminals and have little to say within the migration process. But the relation between the smugglers and the smuggled seems more diverse than that. 3 different types of interaction between the smuggler and the migrant are identified. Subsequently the question is addressed how this process is related to, and interacts with, the context of Dutch migration policies. The increased crack down on unsolicited migration in the Netherlands of the past decade has not reduced the numbers of irregular entries.

In addition to traditional language courses, we have courses covering French culture, current affairs and business French.\r\n\r\nh4. Ciné lumière\r\n\r\nLaunched by Catherine Deneuve in March 1998, Ciné lumière is an independent showcase for the very best in French, European and world cinema. Our repertory features some 600 screenings a year. Festivals, seasons, retrospectives, premieres, new releases, guest star appearances: Ciné lumière is an everyday festival. A public cinema with 300 seats, Ciné lumière is open to everyone. You don't have to be a member of the Institut français - nor do you have to speak French! All films are shown in original version with English subtitles.\r\n\r\nh4. The Multimedia Library\r\n\r\nOur multimedia library offers free access to 52 000 items: books, French newspapers and magazines, videos & DVDs, CDs  and CD-ROMs aimed at Francophiles, French speakers or learners. The library also supplies information services such as the Quick Information Service which provides information and documentation on contemporary France and francophone countries, and the Studies in France Information Desk which promotes cultural and educational exchanges between France and Great Britain.\r\n\r\nh4. Talks Programme\r\n\r\nThe Institut français has a varied programme of talks, giving a wide range of speakers the opportunity to express themselves freely and enter into a dialogue with the public. Thanks to the book launches our audiences are the first to know about the latest translations from French and publications about France.\r\n\r\nh4. French Music Bureau\r\n\r\nThe French Music Bureau is a unique collaboration between the French Government (Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Culture) and the domestic music industry to improve the profile of French popular music in both the UK and worldwide markets. The bureau aims to act as a consultant and offers assistance in the development of artists in every genre of French popular contemporary music. It is an essential communication resource, building a cultural network of coordination, advice, promotion and information with French, British and foreign media, educational institutions and music professionals. \r\n", "members_only": "No", "members_info": "monde-diplo-friends@mondediplo.com", "venue": {"id": 262, "name": "Institut Francais", "slug": "institut-francais", "city": "London", "postcode": "SW7 2DT"}, "organizer": {"id": 262, "name": "Institut Francais", "slug": "institut-francais"}}]}, {"id": 1666, "title": "Consciousness and Healing: Integral Approaches to Mind-Body Medicine", "synopsis": "Integral medicine embraces the recognition that human beings possess emotional, spiritual, and relational dimensions.", "keywords": "Health, medicine, healing, Marilyn Schlitz, Scientific and Medical Network, SMN, consciousness, complementary medicine, alternative medicine, integrate, mind, body, spirit.", "body": "Dr. Marilyn Schlitz, Senior Scientist at the research Institute California Pacific Medical Center will look at the underpinnings and belief systems that support the current medical model.
