Supporting a network of Holocaust researchers is just as important to EHRI as creating a digital infrastructure.

The fundamental questions are answered, leaving only the details to be filled in. The impressive achievements of science seemed to support this confident attitude. But recent research has revealed unexpected problems at the heart of physics, cosmology, biology, medicine and psychology.\r\n\r\nShould science be a belief-system, or a method of enquiry? In the sceptical spirit of true scientific enquiry, Sheldrake turns the ten fundamental dogmas of science into questions, opening up startling new possibilities. For example, the “laws of nature” may be habits that change and evolve. The Gravitational Constant may not be constant. Minds may extend far beyond brains. The total amount of matter and energy may be increasing. Memories may not be stored as traces in our brains. Sheldrake argues that science would be better off without its dogmas: freer, more interesting and more fun. \r\n\r\nRupert Sheldrake, Ph.D. is a biologist and author of more than 80 scientific papers and 10 books, including The Science Delusion (January 2012).

In his new book Lewis sets out the main elements of Bangladesh's politics, economy and civil society in the years since the country gained its independence from Pakistan in 1971.   \r\n\r\nAt this event David Lewis will talk about his new book and then discuss it further with contributions from Professors Guha and Kabeer, followed by a chance for the audience to get involved. Copies of the book will be on sale at the event. \r\n\r\nProfessor Lewis explores the idea that the international community needs to pay more attention to Bangladesh as a place of great interest and importance, and argues that the country has been unwisely neglected in the Western imagination compared with India and Pakistan. Bangladesh is important because (i) it is a majority Muslim country that is making good progress building a stable democratic system; (ii) it is achieving increased economic growth and human development; (ii) the country has long served as an incubator for many key development ideas that have emerged over the past 40 years, (iii) it is a useful portal into understanding the way globalization affects people in the world's poorer countries, and (v) it is a country on the front-line of climate change. \r\n\r\nDavid Lewis is Professor of Social Policy and Development at LSE. Professor Lewis specialises in development policy and management, with particular expertise on NGOs and civil society. His other interests include rural development, organisational issues in development agencies, and anthropological approaches to development. An anthropologist by training, he has undertaken extensive field research in South Asia (particularly Bangladesh) and has advised and consulted for a wide range of international development agencies, NGOs and private sector organisations. \r\n\r\nRamachandra Guha is the Philippe Roman Chair in History and International Affairs for the 2011-2012 academic year at LSE. Ramachandra Guha is a historian and biographer. He has taught at the universities of Yale and Stanford, held the Arné Naess Chair at the University of Oslo, and been the Indo-American Community Visiting Professor at the University of California at Berkeley. His books include a pioneering environmental history, The Unquiet Woods (University of California Press, 1989), and an award-winning social history of cricket, A Corner of a Foreign Field (Picador, 2002). India after Gandhi (Macmillan/Ecco Press, 2007) was chosen as a book of the year by the Economist, the Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal, the San Francisco Chronicle, Time Out, and Outlook, and as a book of the decade in the Times of India, the Times of London, and The Hindu. Guha's books and essays have been translated into more than twenty languages. The New York Times has referred to him as 'perhaps the best among India's non fiction writers'; Time Magazine has called him 'Indian democracy's preeminent chronicler'. In 2008, Prospect and Foreign Policy magazines nominated Guha as one of the world's one hundred most influential intellectuals. \r\n\r\nNaila Kabeer is Professor of Development Studies at SOAS. Professor Kabeer is a social economist and works primarily on poverty, gender, and social policy issues. She is the author of Reversed Realities: Gender Hierarchies in Development Thought (1994) and The Power to Choose: Bangladeshi Women and Labour Market Decisions in London and Dhaka (2000).

The budget cuts have put further burdens on vulnerable and already destitute people. Inequalities, already growing for three decades, have deepened further. The protection of economic and social rights has become an acute concern in today's Europe. People in the \"new underclass\" have little voice in politics and often do not even know how and to whom to complain when their rights are violated. Their fear and sense of not belonging are exploited by right-wing extremist groups promoting xenophobia which targets immigrants, Muslims and Roma. \r\n\r\nThe law-based system of justice is undermined by corruption and political interference in several European states. The European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg continues to receive some one thousand applications every week. Its rulings have exposed cases of police brutality, unfair or delayed trials, non-implementation of sentences and inhuman conditions of detention. In addition, European countries have been unable to come clean on the nature of their security cooperation with the United States during the \"war on terror\" and their own complicity in a policy which allowed torture as a means of interrogation. \r\n\r\nThe conclusion, in Thomas Hammarberg's opinion, is that there is a need for European self-criticism – and concrete improvements which also reach the poorest and the most marginalised. Politicians need to reconfirm their commitment to principled values and stand up for them: ensuring respect for the other, including minorities and foreigners; promoting equality and non-discrimination; enforcing fundamental principles of justice, such as equality before the law and presumption of innocence. \r\n\r\nThe malfunctioning of the democratic process is also a human rights problem. Popular participation in political decision-making is generally minimal in most European countries today. Communication between politicians and their electorate is mainly via the media and surveys show that the respect for those elected is low and decreasing. A genuine, democratic dialogue is needed. Both social and mass media are key for such a dialogue. The potential of non-governmental groups can be much better utilised for the common good. \r\n\r\nIn this lecture, Thomas Hammarberg will address these matters, and the need for a new strategy for human rights which also addresses the problems in democratic states. \r\n\r\nThomas Hammarberg was elected Commissioner for Human Rights on 5 October 2005 by the Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly. He took up his position on 1 April 2006, succeeding the first commissioner, Mr Alvaro Gil-Robles. \r\n\r\nPrior to his appointment, he spent several decades working on the advancement of human rights in Europe and worldwide. He has held the key posts of Secretary General of the Stockholm-based Olof Palme International Center (2002-2005), Ambassador of the Swedish Government on Humanitarian Affairs (1994-2002), Secretary General of \"Save the Children\" Sweden (1986-1992), and Secretary General of the London-based Amnesty International (1980-1986). He received on behalf of Amnesty International the Noble Peace Prize 1977. \r\n\r\nMr Hammarberg also held several special positions during these years. In 2001-2003, he served as Regional Adviser for Europe, Central Asia and the Caucasus for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. For several years, he was the Swedish Prime Minister's Personal Representative for the UN Special Session on Children, as well as the Convener of the Aspen Institute Roundtables on \"Human Rights in Peace Missions\". Between 1996 and 2000, he was Kofi Annan's appointed representative (SRSG) for human rights in Cambodia. He also participated in the work of the Refugee Working Group of the multilateral Middle East Peace Process. \r\n\r\nMr Hammarberg has published widely on various human rights issues, particularly on children's rights, refugee policy, minority issues, xenophobia, Roma rights as well as international affairs and security. He is also well known for his presentations and lectures on human rights at various governmental and academic institutions. \r\n\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 732, "added": "2010-10-29T08:12:57", "slug": "european-democracies-and-human-rights-from-present-failures-to-future-protection", "speakers": [{"id": 10199, "name": "Thomas Hammarberg", "slug": "thomas-hammarberg"}], "topics": [{"id": 934, "name": "rights", "path": "/academic/philosophy/ethics/rights"}], "supercategory": "academic", "venue": {"id": 2131, "name": "Old Theatre", "slug": "old-theatre", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC2A 2AE"}, "organizer": {"id": 1287, "name": "London School of Economics & Political Science", "slug": "london-school-of-economics-political-science"}, "date": "2010-12-09", "dates": [{"id": 9183, "from_date": "2010-12-09", "to_date": "2010-12-09", "time": "18:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": "This event is free and open to all with no ticket required.

Arrive 6pm for a 6:30pm Start - Pay on the door\r\n\r\nLaura Huxley’s candid recollections offer a compelling glimpse into her life with one of the greatest writers and visionaries of the 20th century. She was a teenage violin virtuoso who met Aldous soon after leaving the concert stage for Hollywood. His 1932 novel Brave New World established him as an undisputed literary giant. They married in 1956. Sharing an interest in the evolution of human consciousness, the Huxleys pioneered the use of LSD. Their lives and work impacted generations and gave shape to an important chapter of American cultural history.\r\n\r\nThe Huxley home in the Hollywood Hills was a hotspot for west coast avant-garde and attracted luminaries as Orson Welles, Igor Stravinsky, George Cukor and Christopher Isherwood. Laura guided Aldous through LSD and Mescaline experimentations that inspired his final novel, Island. These explorations set the stage for the 60s.\r\n\r\nIn 1961 the Huxleys began experimenting with fellow seekers Dick Alpert (now Ram Dass) and Timothy Leary. Aldous’ lectures on the Human Potential Movement led to the founding of the Esalen Institute in 1961, where it attracted seekers of expanded states of human consciousness.\r\n\r\nThe film is narrated by Peter Coyote and includes interviews with Laura Huxley, drummer John Densmore (whose band, the Doors, was named after Huxley’s book The Doors of Perception), spiritual leader Ram Dass, Esalen co- founder Michael Murphy, artist Don Bachardy, philosopher Huston Smith and actor Nick Nolte, star of the adaptation of Huxley’s novel The Genius and The Goddess.\r\n\r\nHuxley on Huxley is an intimate portrait of a compelling personal and professional union.\r\n\r\nMary Ann Braubach graduated from UCLA Film School and, after beginning her career directing documentaries, became director of development for George Lucas at his Lucasfilm headquarters in Marin County.

His book is a sweeping new interpretation of the history of civilization, that looks at the evolution of empathy and the profound ways that it has shaped our development-and is likely to determine our fate as a species. \r\n\r\nToday we face unparalleled challenges in an energy-intensive and interconnected world that will demand an unprecedented level of mutual understanding among diverse peoples and nations. Do we have the capacity and collective will to come together in a way that will enable us to cope with the great challenges of our time? \r\n\r\nIn this remarkable book Jeremy Rifkin tells the dramatic story of the extension of human empathy from the rise of the first great theological civilizations, to the ideological age that dominated the 18th and 19th centuries, the psychological era that characterized much of the 20th century and the emerging dramaturgical period of the 21st century. The result is a new social tapestry-The Empathic Civilization-woven from a wide range of fields. \r\n\r\nRifkin argues that at the very core of the human story is the paradoxical relationship between empathy and entropy. At various times in history new energy regimes have converged with new communication revolutions, creating ever more complex societies that heightened empathic sensitivity and expanded human consciousness. But these increasingly complicated milieus require extensive energy use and speed us toward resource depletion. \r\n\r\nThe irony is that our growing empathic awareness has been made possible by an ever-greater consumption of the Earth's resources, resulting in a dramatic deterioration of the health of the planet. If we are to avert a catastrophic destruction of the Earth's ecosystems, the collapse of the global economy and the possible extinction of the human race, we will need to change human consciousness itself-and in less than a generation. \r\n\r\nRifkin challenges us to address what may be the most important question facing humanity today: Can we achieve global empathy in time to avoid the collapse of civilization and save the planet? \r\n\r\nJeremy Rifkin is the author of The Empathic Civilization: The Race to Global Consciousness in a World in Crisis, published by Tarcher Penguin in January 2010.  Mr. Rifkin has been an advisor to the European Union since 2002. He also is an advisor to heads of state including Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, Prime Minister Zapatero of Spain, Prime Minister George Papandreou of Greece, and Prince Albert II of Monaco. In that capacity, he is the principal architect of the Third Industrial Revolution long-term economic sustainability plan to address the triple challenge of the global economic crisis, energy security, and climate change. The Third Industrial Revolution was formally endorsed by the European Parliament in 2007 and is now being implemented by various agencies within the European Commission as well as in the 27 member-states. \r\n\r\nMr. Rifkin is also the founder and chairperson of the Third Industrial Revolution Global CEO Business Roundtable, comprised of 100 of the world's leading renewable energy companies, construction companies, architectural firms, real estate companies, IT companies, power and utility companies, and transport and logistics companies. Mr. Rifkin's global economic development team is the largest of its kind in the world and is working with cities, regions, and national governments to develop master plans to transition their economies into post- carbon Third Industrial Revolution infrastructures. \r\n\r\nMr. Rifkin is a senior lecturer at the Wharton School's Executive Education Program at the University of Pennsylvania—the world's #1 ranked business school—where he instructs CEOs and senior management on transitioning their business operations into sustainable Third Industrial Revolution economies. \r\n\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 60, "image_id": 732, "added": "2010-03-01T20:58:55", "slug": "ea592bce8c6726eb", "speakers": [{"id": 5319, "name": "Jeremy Rifkin", "slug": "jeremy-rifkin"}], "topics": [{"id": 1398, "name": "evolution", "path": "/academic/science/philosophy/engineering/biology/medicine/evolut"}, {"id": 1399, "name": "evolution", "path": "/academic/science/philosophy/engineering/biology/medicine/evolut"}, {"id": 1988, "name": "ideology", "path": "/academic/politics/europe/ideology"}, {"id": 366, "name": "theology", "path": "/arts/philosophy/theology"}], "supercategory": "academic", "venue": {"id": 1287, "name": "London School of Economics & Political Science", "slug": "london-school-of-economics-political-science", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC2A 2AE"}, "organizer": {"id": 1287, "name": "London School of Economics & Political Science", "slug": "london-school-of-economics-political-science"}, "date": "2010-03-19", "dates": [{"id": 8228, "from_date": "2010-03-19", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "13:00:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": null, "additional_info": "This event is free and open to all with no ticket required.

A small yet diverse group, caecilians are characterised by a largely tropical distribution, elongate and limbless bodies, and enigmatic behaviour. Modern caecilians evolved from limbed ancestors and have several peculiar adaptations, including a pair of protrusible sensory tentacles, eyes covered by skin and/or bone, and scales embedded in pockets within the skin. The reproductive biology of caecilians is also remarkable for its diversity: the young of some species have been discovered to peel and eat the nutrient-enriched skin of their brooding mothers. A lack of knowledge and study of caecilians has resulted in an astonishing two-thirds being Data Deficient on the _IUCN Red List of Threatened Species_. An introduction to caecilians will be given, and current and future directions for research and conservation will be discussed.\r\n\r\n*This event will be chaired by Ken Livingstone.*\r\n\r\nTalk titles:\r\nAn introduction to the world of naked snakes;\r\nRecent discoveries – a golden age for caecilian biology?;\r\nYummy mummy: skin feeding and caecilian reproductive biology;\r\nCaecilians on the EDGE.\r\n\r\n_Organised by Helen Meredith, ZSL, and Dr David Gower, The Natural History Museum, London._\r\n\r\n\r\nThis event in the 'Communicating Science' series will begin at 6.00pm (doors from 5.00pm) and talks are scheduled to finish at 7.30pm; admission is free and open to everyone (no advance booking or registration required).

But why do so many plants flower in the spring, and how do they time their flowering to coincide with spring every year? \r\n\r\nMany plants actually need a long period of cold before they are able to flower; this ensures they only flower after the winter has passed, when conditions for setting seed are more favourable. Average winter temperatures have been rising over the past 25 years. Soon our changing climate may result in temperatures that are no longer cold enough to trigger this flowering process and plants may fail to flower at the correct time. This has serious and worrying implications for our environment and agriculture.\r\n\r\nResearchers at the John Innes Centre are tackling this problem using a small weedy plant called Arabidopsis thaliana, commonly known as thale cress. This grows throughout the northern hemisphere from the equator to the Arctic circle, thus surviving a huge range of climates. The genome of this plant has been sequenced so it is relatively straightforward to identify the genes controlling growth and development. Our aim is to understand how this plant species has adapted to very different winter conditions, adjusting its flowering response to the length of the winter. This information may help plant breeders select crops suited to our changing climate.\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": null, "added": "2008-01-09T09:00:15", "slug": "7b5e4dbbf685c0a4", "speakers": [{"id": 6378, "name": "Amy Strange", "slug": "amy-strange"}, {"id": 6379, "name": "Dr Judith Irwin", "slug": "dr-judith-irwin"}], "topics": [{"id": 868, "name": "climate", "path": "/science/climatechange/climate"}, {"id": 939, "name": "plants", "path": "/leisure/gardening/plants"}], "supercategory": "science", "venue": {"id": 1382, "name": "Royal Institution", "slug": "royal-institution", "city": "London", "postcode": "W1S 4BS"}, "organizer": {"id": 1382, "name": "Royal Institution", "slug": "royal-institution"}, "date": "2008-04-15", "dates": [{"id": 5282, "from_date": "2008-04-15", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "6:30:00", "ticket_cost": "£8 standard, £6 concessions, £4 Ri members", "ticket_info": "www.rigb.org or call 020 7409 2992", "additional_info": null, "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 1382, "name": "Royal Institution", "slug": "royal-institution", "city": "London", "postcode": "W1S 4BS"}, "organizer": {"id": 1382, "name": "Royal Institution", "slug": "royal-institution"}}]}, {"id": 4818, "title": "In the picture with Heathcliff O'Malley", "synopsis": "Photographs from the front line in the War on Terror in conversation with Peter Beaumont", "keywords": "Iraq, War, Afghanistan, Photographer", "body": "Heathcliff O’Malley recently returned from an embed with coalition forces on the front line of the worsening Iraq war where he shot some of the most defining photographs to come out of the region in recent months.
