He reflects on what we are as human beings and how we can live the best life possible, even under difficult or challenging circumstances.  Exploring the relationship between the soul and the body, the roles of the virtues or excellences in human life, and the nature of reality itself, Porphyry offers Marcella – and his reader in a wider sense – intimate personal reflections and advice on living a philosophical way of life, including how to overcome and move beyond obstacles, distractions and difficulties.

His talk sets out to present how his research process has led to some startling discoveries that challenge some commonly held beliefs and traditions, while affirming or reclaiming others. Notions of a constant centre of gravity and of ‘neutral’ positioning are amongst the beliefs he examines, as are the claims that imagination is better than science or that more mobility is necessarily healthier. Frey argues that his findings suggest a reconsideration of certain attitudes and procedural treatments, in relation to both our bodies and our environment.\r\n\r\n\r\nBiography\r\nFrey Faust was given direction, discipline and the chance to develop a passion for his chosen muse by his mother, Shekhinah Mountainwater, a known author and leading figure in the women’s spiritual movement of America. He worked under her direction from age 8 to age 15, performing as a pantomime-dancer-actor in all manner of circumstances, from the street to the theater.\r\n\r\nNita Little, a participant in the initiation of CI, initiated him to its liberating concepts at the age of 14. At Marcel Marceau’s invitation he then went to Paris to study intensively at the former’s Ecole de Mimodrame for one year. Afterwards, he returned to California to pursue his personal education through the practice of Afro-Haitian dance, Aikido, Capoiera and Percussion. In 1980, he decided to try his luck in New York.\r\n\r\nTen years later, having worked with some of the best of the NY movers and shakers such as David Parsons, Donald Byrd, Randy Warshaw, Gina Buntz,Ohad Naharin, Meredith Monk, Merce Cunningham and Stephen Petronio, he was granted the opportunity to be the artist in residence at the Werkstatt, Düsseldorf, Germany for two years (now the Tanzhaus NRW). There he was able, with the generous support of the German government, to create six solos and three evening-length works and to begin the consolidation of his pedagogical ideas. He is the author of the book and the originator of the Axis Syllabus-universal motor principles; a method for teaching movement through which he aspires to assist his students to deepen their understanding and use of nature's gift to us.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.axissyllabus.com/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTickets:\r\nSingle talk £6 | £4 freelance and concession\r\n3-talk cards £16.50 | £10.50 freelance and concession\r\n\r\nDrinks Offer: Free drinks voucher for the first 20 people who book for any talk \r\n\r\nTo book, please call 020 7091 9650 or email info@independentdance.co.uk\r\n\r\nVenue:\r\nIndependent Dance\r\nSiobhan Davies Studios \r\n85 St. Georges Road\r\nLondon\r\nSE1 6ER", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 1768, "added": "2014-11-27T20:01:56", "slug": "b4b997dc79944b55", "speakers": [{"id": 15238, "name": "Frey Faust", "slug": "frey-faust"}], "topics": [{"id": 2676, "name": "dance", "path": "/arts/arts/education/dance"}, {"id": 1869, "name": "performance", "path": "/arts/film/videoart/performance"}, {"id": 3399, "name": "performance", "path": "/arts/art/contemporaryart/performance"}, {"id": 1018, "name": "talk", "path": "/arts/education/debate/talk"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 1781, "name": "Independent Dance", "slug": "independent-dance", "city": "London", "postcode": "SE1 6ER"}, "organizer": {"id": 1781, "name": "Independent Dance", "slug": "independent-dance"}, "date": "2014-12-02", "dates": [{"id": 14843, "from_date": "2014-12-02", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "19:00:00", "ticket_cost": "£4-£6", "ticket_info": "Please call Siobhan Davies reception on 020 7091 9650 or email info@independentdance.co.uk.", "additional_info": null, "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 1781, "name": "Independent Dance", "slug": "independent-dance", "city": "London", "postcode": "SE1 6ER"}, "organizer": {"id": 1781, "name": "Independent Dance", "slug": "independent-dance"}}]}, {"id": 14232, "title": "Guided imagery and visualisation for therapeutic change", "synopsis": "Guided imagery is one of the most powerful, psychotherapeutic tools known to induce the relaxation response in patients.", "keywords": "guided imagery, visualisation, treatment, emotional conditions, mind/body system, healing, rewind technique, problem behaviour, stress, relaxation, counselling, psychology", "body": "Strong emotions focus and lock attention - keeping people trapped in problem behaviours.

By the mid to late 1980’s, there was a consensus view that if emissions remain unabated a range of catastrophic impacts on humanity could ensue. In the intervening period this perspective has remained unchanged and has largely been reinforced by the significant volume of ongoing research that has been undertaken. The cornerstone international response to the science was defined in 1997 (The Kyoto Protocol) under the auspices of the United Nations. This established emission reduction targets for developed countries which are binding under international law. Numerous follow-on international meetings, discussions and negotiations have been held, national government departments established and rafts of policies introduced. However, in spite of these substantial resources, derisory progress has been made and CO&#8322; emissions continue their inexorable rise. We can have no real confidence that disastrous outcomes will be avoided.\r\nIn this presentation the case will be made that it is, in fact, unsurprising that we are in this position as we are pursuing a strategy that is both intellectually flawed and ethically unsound. An alternative route forward is proposed. \r\nDr David Williams was trained as a research scientist and held academic research posts prior to moving to industry. For the following 30 years he held managerial and executive positions in science based businesses and multi-national companies.

While the 2011 Arab Spring is well known, the wave of uprisings that swept Asia in the 1980s remain hardly visible. Through a critique of Samuel Huntington’s notion of a “Third Wave” of democratization, the author relates Asian uprisings to predecessors in 1968 and shows their subsequent influence on uprisings in Eastern Europe at the end of the 1980s. \r\n\r\n“This book about people's power movements in Asia over the last sixty years makes the case, convincingly, that they should be seen as part of the worldwide new left. Reading it will broaden the perspective of activists and analysts in North America and Europe, a very important task.”\r\n--Immanuel Wallerstein, Yale University\r\n\r\nGeorge Katsiaficas is author or editor of eleven books, including ones on the global uprising of 1968 and European and Asian social movements. A Fulbright Fellow and student of Herbert Marcuse, he is the author of The Imagination of the New Left: A Global Analysis of 1968. His book, The Subversion of Politics: European Autonomous Social Movements and the Decolonization of Everyday Life, was co-winner of the APSA's 1998 Michael Harrington book award.\r\n\r\nAmong his edited volumes are Liberation, Imagination and the Black Panther Party (with Kathleen Cleaver) and Vietnam Documents: American and Vietnamese Views of the War. A longtime activist for peace and justice, he is International Coordinator of the May 18 Institute at Chonnam National University in Gwangju, South Korea, and teaches at Wentworth Institute of Technology in Boston.\r\n\r\nGeronimo is the author of Fire and Flames, the first comprehensive study of the German autonomous movement ever published. The author, writing under a pseudonym, has been an autonomous activist since the movement burst onto the scene in 1980-81. Tactics of the ‘Autonome’ were militant, including the construction of barricades or throwing everything at the police. Because of their outfit (heavy black clothing, ski masks, helmets), the Autonome were dubbed the ‘Black Bloc’ by the German media, and their tactics have been successfully adopted and employed at anti-capitalist protests worldwide. \r\n\r\nThis event is being held on the eve of the London Anarchist Bookfair, the UK’s biggest anarchist gathering, featuring a whole host of speakers, authors, acticvists, publishers and booksellers.

", "synopsis": "Is there potential for a European Spring, or is it more a case of hope springs eternal?", "keywords": "Debate, Riots", "body": "Such was the global political upheaval of last year that many across the political spectrum were moved to ask whether 2011 would become as era-defining as 1968 and 1989. Even those uncertain about the aims and prospects for the Arab Spring couldn’t help but feel inspired by the youth-led demands for democracy and change, which stood in stark contrast to the seeming conservatism and apathy of their Western counterparts. Similar enthusiasm for the spirited rebellion of the young has been shown towards a number of anti-austerity movements such UK Uncut, Spain’s Indignados, Alexis Tsipiras’ Greek SYRIZA coalition and the youthful support for Hollande in France. Meanwhile, from one-off demonstrations such as SlutWalk to large-scale calls for social change like Occupy, social media has become an increasingly influential mobilisation tool for global protest.\r\n\r\nYet a celebration of the radicalisation of previously apathetic youth turns to profound concern over the rise of a ‘new European far right’, with the likes of Hungary’s Jobbik and Finland’s True Finns complemented by the electoral breakthroughs of Le Pen in France and Golden Dawn in Greece. There is much discussion of how what unites European youth is the relative hopelessness of the ‘jilted generation’, saddled with debt, ageing populations and high unemployment. The exodus of the young from crisis-ridden countries such as Ireland and Greece seems to indicate the depths of youthful desperation, although some see opportunity for new allegiances and communities of interest to be formed through the turmoil. For some, last summer’s English riots were an angry and incoherent reaction against the politics of austerity; for others, however, the nihilism of the riots suggested that the generation told they have ‘no future’ had become a self-fulfilling prophecy.\r\n\r\nDo Europe’s youth need to unite together as particular victims of the crisis, or would such a perspective simply breed division between the generations, undermining social solidarity? Is it useful to discuss social movements and problems in generational terms at all?  Are there grounds for apprehension in the rise of populism, or is there a danger of scaremongering? Is there potential for a European Spring, or is it more a case of hope springs eternal?\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 120, "image_id": 1747, "added": "2012-09-13T11:56:51", "slug": "3ad14af171a378f8", "speakers": [{"id": 2134, "name": "Professor Clive Bloom", "slug": "professor-clive-bloom"}, {"id": 7041, "name": "Neil Davenport", "slug": "neil-davenport"}, {"id": 12744, "name": "Ashley  Frawley", "slug": "ashley-frawley"}, {"id": 12745, "name": "Thais  Portilho-Shrimpton", "slug": "thais-portilho-shrimpton"}, {"id": 12746, "name": "Myriam  Francois-Cerrah", "slug": "myriam-francois-cerrah"}], "topics": [{"id": 942, "name": "debate", "path": "/arts/books/poetry/debate"}, {"id": 1779, "name": "debate", "path": "/arts/books/nonfiction/debate"}, {"id": 457, "name": "debate", "path": "/academic/rhetoric/debate"}, {"id": 941, "name": "debate", "path": "/arts/books/debate"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 1776, "name": "Foyles", "slug": "foyles", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC2H 0EB"}, "organizer": {"id": 45, "name": "Institute of Ideas", "slug": "institute-of-ideas"}, "date": "2012-10-08", "dates": [{"id": 11874, "from_date": "2012-10-08", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "18:30:00", "ticket_cost": "£7.50 (£5.00)", "ticket_info": "http://www.instituteofideas.com/tickets/battlesatellites2012.html", "additional_info": "Visit www.battleofideas.org.uk for more information", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 1776, "name": "Foyles", "slug": "foyles", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC2H 0EB"}, "organizer": {"id": 45, "name": "Institute of Ideas", "slug": "institute-of-ideas"}}]}, {"id": 11414, "title": "Henry Armstrong Memorial Lecture", "synopsis": "Henry Armstrong, the Society’s first Messel Medallist, is recognised as a visionary and pioneer and founding father of chemical engineering.", "keywords": "SCI, Messel, chemistry, engineering, Professor John Blacker, improving manufacturing efficiency", "body": "His life’s work was centred on chemistry education within engineering schools and he played an important part in establishing the SCI Process Engineering Group.\r\n\r\nThis year SCI are delighted that Professor John Blacker will be presenting the Henry Armstrong Memorial Lecture.

Using his theory of ‘intellectual competence’ as the over-arching framework, he will attempt to (a) highlight advantages and disadvantages of incorporating psychometric assessment protocols into selection policies; (b) discuss inconsistencies between theoretical solutions and practical needs; and (c) speculate about the macro-economic and political consequences of a personality-centred approach to understanding human potential and talent.\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 120, "image_id": 1403, "added": "2011-10-23T10:07:09", "slug": "27e36b84b1705fb3", "speakers": [{"id": 11712, "name": "Dr Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic", "slug": "dr-tomas-chamorro-premuzic"}], "topics": [{"id": 743, "name": "education", "path": "/academic/arts/linguistics/education"}, {"id": 2192, "name": "assessment", "path": "/academic/education/assessment"}, {"id": 744, "name": "education", "path": "/academic/linguistics/education"}, {"id": 745, "name": "education", "path": "/arts/language/education"}], "supercategory": "academic", "venue": {"id": 1424, "name": "Downing College", "slug": "downing-college", "city": "Cambridge", "postcode": "CB2 1DQ"}, "organizer": {"id": 2297, "name": "Cambridge Assessment Network", "slug": "cambridge-assessment-network"}, "date": "2012-01-25", "dates": [{"id": 10743, "from_date": "2012-01-25", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "16:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": null, "additional_info": "To book a place please contact the Network Team on 01223 553846 or thenetwork@cambridgeassessment.org.uk.", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 1424, "name": "Downing College", "slug": "downing-college", "city": "Cambridge", "postcode": "CB2 1DQ"}, "organizer": {"id": 2297, "name": "Cambridge Assessment Network", "slug": "cambridge-assessment-network"}}]}, {"id": 10205, "title": "Whose Morality is it Anyway?", "synopsis": "What voice does society have in dictating public morality?

Shaping Cities is an Urban Age public lecture series organised by LSE Cities that identifies the growing complexity of architectural practice in relation to the challenges of exponential urbanism. \r\n\r\nHashim Sarkis is the Aga Khan Professor of Landscape Architecture and Urbanism, Graduate School of Design, Harvard University. \r\n\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 732, "added": "2010-05-18T09:43:34", "slug": "beirut-normal", "speakers": [{"id": 9542, "name": "Professor Hashim Sarkis", "slug": "professor-hashim-sarkis"}, {"id": 2646, "name": "Professor  Ricky Burdett", "slug": "professor-ricky-burdett"}], "topics": [{"id": 385, "name": "architecture", "path": "/arts/museums/architecture"}, {"id": 190, "name": "architecture", "path": "/arts/architecture"}, {"id": 1848, "name": "architecture", "path": "/academic/architecture"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 2223, "name": "Wolfson Theatre", "slug": "wolfson-theatre", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC2A 2AE"}, "organizer": {"id": 1287, "name": "London School of Economics & Political Science", "slug": "london-school-of-economics-political-science"}, "date": "2010-05-25", "dates": [{"id": 8382, "from_date": "2010-05-25", "to_date": "2010-05-25", "time": "18:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": null, "additional_info": "This event is free and open to all with no ticket required.

Bailouts, unrest and the future of the eurozone\r\n\r\nSpeakers: Geoff Kidder, membership and events director, Institute of Ideas and Rob Lyons, deputy editor, Spiked.\r\n\r\nChair: Patrick Hayes, IoI Current Affairs Forum\r\n\r\nDave loves Nick and Nick loves Dave. But while attention has focused on which form of government will manage the deficit, developments abroad will arguably do more to shape the UK's fortunes in the short term than who sits where in the ‘historic’ coalition. Whilst the recent agreement to reluctantly put together a 750bn-euro package of funds by European governments and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has calmed fears of imminent financial collapse in the eurozone, many believe that this bailout had simply off-set the problem. Greece - often dubbed the ‘weakest link in the eurozone’ - is facing violent civil unrest, a public deficit of 13.6% and debts of €300bn, all predicted to increase significantly. And a collapse in Greece could potentially be the ‘first domino’ that will bring the other PIIGS (Portugal, Ireland, Italy and Spain), and potentially the whole of the EU, crashing down.\r\n\r\nIn order to meet debt repayments, Greek leaders are forcing citizens to swallow the ‘bitter pill’ of extreme austerity measures - including major cuts in public sector welfare and services and sharp cuts to wages and pensions – alongside implementing reforms to modernise the economy and improve productivity. The Greek people, it seems, don’t want to take the cuts in living standards lying down and the announcement of a general strike next Wednesday is the latest in the series of protests that are hitting the economy hard and making investors nervous.\r\n\r\nWho is to blame for the crisis? What needs to be done to deal with the root causes of the financial crisis in Europe? Should the Greek people recognise that they are ‘all in it together’, accept austerity measures in the name of the National Interest and long-term stability of their economy? Have they been enjoying the EU ‘gravy train’ for too long and now need to stop smashing their plates in protest, instead facing up to some harsh realities? Or, indeed, would it be better if Greece defaulted on loan repayments, declared bankruptcy and withdrew from the eurozone completely? Are these problems peculiar to Greece and the ‘Club Med’ or could the UK catch the ‘Greek disease’? If so, what would need to be done to prevent it? Is another global economic crisis on the cards?\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 120, "image_id": null, "added": "2010-05-18T09:42:48", "slug": "3b128fe940f34416", "speakers": [{"id": 9759, "name": "Mr Geoff Kidder", "slug": "mr-geoff-kidder"}, {"id": 8833, "name": "Mr Rob Lyons", "slug": "mr-rob-lyons"}], "topics": [{"id": 1474, "name": "culture", "path": "/academic/society/culture/culture"}, {"id": 942, "name": "debate", "path": "/arts/books/poetry/debate"}, {"id": 1779, "name": "debate", "path": "/arts/books/nonfiction/debate"}, {"id": 827, "name": "finance", "path": "/business/training/finance"}], "supercategory": "academic", "venue": {"id": 2103, "name": "The Perseverance", "slug": "the-perseverance", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC1N 3NB"}, "organizer": {"id": 45, "name": "Institute of Ideas", "slug": "institute-of-ideas"}, "date": "2010-05-18", "dates": [{"id": 8664, "from_date": "2010-05-18", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "19:00:00", "ticket_cost": "FREE (RSVP Required)", "ticket_info": "RSVP to: patrickhayes@instituteofideas.com", "additional_info": "Readings can be found here: http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=122148307795892&ref=mf#!/event.php?eid=122148307795892&ref=mf", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 2103, "name": "The Perseverance", "slug": "the-perseverance", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC1N 3NB"}, "organizer": {"id": 45, "name": "Institute of Ideas", "slug": "institute-of-ideas"}}]}, {"id": 8278, "title": "Watts Symposium: Decorating Sacred Spaces", "synopsis": "Day One exploring artists who have decorated spiritual spaces to create a context for Mary Watts's Cemetery Chapel.", "keywords": "Watts, Chapel, Sacred, Artist, Spiritual, Stanley Spencer, St Paul's Cathedral, London, Surrey, Curator, Arts & Crafts, Tate, Daily Telegraph", "body": "Summer 2010 will celebrate Mary Watts's Cemetery Chapel, a pioneering community art project completed in 1904 in the village of Compton, Surrey.

Indeed, the pioneer of Russian music in England Gerald Abraham wrote wryly, ‘Dostoevsky’s writings certainly do not cry out for musical treatment; nevertheless they have been given it.’ This talk will describe and discuss in layman’s language and with visual and aural illustrations a few of the eight or so Russian operas from between 1903 and 1985, some of the excellent musical scores to Russian films based on the writer’s works, as well as a sample of a brilliant song cycle by Shostakovich himself. This, like the film version of ‘A Nasty Story’, gains greatly from its musical component. Some of the great novels on the other hand like Idiot and Brothers Karamazov are more of a curiosity, the operas being alternatives rather than embellishments. This talk aims to provide an entertaining view of a wide range of Dostoevsky’s prose set to music by Russian composers.\r\n\r\nAfter graduating with first class honours in Russian Language and Literature (with Latin) at SSEES in 1963, and then having spent a year in Moscow, Arnold McMillin was appointed as Lecturer in Russian Language and Literature at SSEES in 1965. In 1971 he gained a doctorate in Slavonic philology, and in 1976 he was made Bowes Professor of Russian at Liverpool University. He returned to SSEES in 1987, and succeeded Richard Freeborn as Professor of Russian Literature. Professor Arnold McMillin retired in 2007. He has been President of the British Universities Association of Slavists (1984-86), and served as British representative on the International Committee of Slavists (1979-88).

Thus argues Gabor Steingart, in his controversial and thought-provoking new book The War for Wealth: The True Story of Globalization (McGraw-Hill, June 2008) which he will present for the first time in the UK. \r\n\r\nLike most business men, the political elite believe that the global economy has created a win-win-situation: a flat world without borders and limits, promising everyone a fair chance. Steingart disagrees, \"Unfortunately the flat-earth mentality is wrong, globalization is not a unifying force, but rather a divisive one.\" What he sees outside is a global shift in power and prosperity. Not satisfied with the doomsday scenarios which are so popular these days among the opponents of globalization, Steingart passionately advocates the foundation of the United States of the West, with a Harvard style first-class education for everybody and the first consumer revolution in world history.\r\n\r\nHenry Kissinger calls Steingart's new book \"a lucid and compelling reality check\". Robert Kuttner, co-founder of the American Economic Policy Institute, says: \"This is the essential book rethinking globalization\". \r\n\r\nGabor Steingart is an international bestselling author and senior correspondent of Der Spiegel in Washington DC. He has been awarded the Economic Writer of the Year Award 2004 in Germany, and in 2007 he won the Helmut Schmidt Award for Advanced Journalism. His op-ed pieces are published in The Wall Street Journal and European Affairs. His weekly column 'West Wing - The Battle for the White House' appears on Spiegel Online, BusinessWeek.com and RealClearPolitics.com. With his critical view on Democratic presidential hopeful Barack Obama, Steingart has become a controversial figure in the US Media. His columns and op-eds are widely discussed in the blogosphere, from Foreign Affairs.com and myspace.com to the New Republican.com. \r\n\r\nSteingart joined Der Spiegel in 1990 as an economic writer, responsible for covering the Eastern, formerly Communist part of Germany. He later served as a financial correspondent in Bonn, before the capital moved to Berlin. From 1993 to 2000 Steingart headed the economic department of a news magazine in Hamburg, before becoming bureau chief of Der Spiegel in Berlin. In 2007 he moved to the United States, as senior correspondent in Washington D.C. \r\n\r\nSteingart studied economics and political science in Marburg and Berlin and graduated from the Freie Universität Berlin. In his thesis he focused on the reality of the planed economy in the socialist part of Germany and predicted the breakdown of the so called German Democratic Republic, GDR. After university he attended the Georg von Holtzbrinck School for Economic Journalism. \r\n\r\nThis lecture is organised in association with the LSE Students Union German Society.\r\n\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 732, "added": "2008-06-02T02:03:46", "slug": "the-war-for-wealth-the-true-story-of-globalization-and-how-western-society-can-survive", "speakers": [{"id": 6944, "name": "Gabor Steingart", "slug": "gabor-steingart"}], "topics": [{"id": 1272, "name": "germany", "path": "/society/history/germany"}, {"id": 1450, "name": "germany", "path": "/politics/europe/germany"}, {"id": 1230, "name": "globalisation", "path": "/society/globalisation"}, {"id": 1270, "name": "globalisation", "path": "/politics/globalisation"}], "supercategory": "society", "venue": {"id": 1521, "name": "Old Theatre, London School of Economics & Political Science", "slug": "old-theatre-london-school-of-economics-political-science", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC2A 2AE"}, "organizer": {"id": 1287, "name": "London School of Economics & Political Science", "slug": "london-school-of-economics-political-science"}, "date": "2008-06-10", "dates": [{"id": 5771, "from_date": "2008-06-10", "to_date": "2008-06-10", "time": "18:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": "This event is free and open to all with no ticket required.

Dr Tony Street received his doctorate in Geology from Cambridge 30 years ago and has since then worked in rock business as a one-man mission for ethical trading, sourcing and dealing.

He will be doing this talk with a table-full of samples showing the real and the fake, the genuine and the doctored, and will be teaching people how quickly to tell the differences. Anyone who buys rocks, crystals, stones or fossils – even if you just got a piece of amethyst for your pagan altar – will be both horrified and fascinated. We promise, you will never look at a lump of turquoise or obsidian the same way again.\r\n\r\nTony is a lively and entertaining speaker, and his talks always have a touch of the stand-up comedy feel to them, and not simply because he bears an uncanny resemblance to Billy Connolly.

What stands out from this perspective are the capacities of domestic appliances, like water cookers, electricity meters and heat pumps, for affectively engaging their users in issues of energy use, climate change, and the sustainable economy. These technologies, which are both informational and material, can be said to enable a particular redefinition of public involvement: IT must now be understood in terms of the socio-material implication of domestic subjects in the proliferation of green issues. In this respect, different theoretical understandings of “affective politics” can be seen to intersect in the eco-home. Post-Foucauldian perspectives on the emotive enrolment of subjects are equally relevant to it as materialist conceptions of the political community in terms of “those who are jointly affected by issues.” However, eco-homes can also be seen to challenge these understandings, to the extent that they activate the experimentalist question, “Are you capable of being affected?” From this standpoint, what deserves special attention are the ambivalences that are currently being built into the eco-home: it serves both as an instrument of the materialization of environmental citizenship, and is a factor in the virtualization of the issue of climate change. In this context, finally, questions can be raised about the affective capacities of social theory itself, in terms of its own responsiveness to the challenges posed by green issues.\r\n\r\nNoortje Marres is a Marie Curie Research Fellow at the Sociology Department, Goldsmiths, University of London. Having been trained in science and technology studies, her current research is concerned with material technologies of politics, as deployed in the context of climate change. She received her PhD in Philosophy from the University of Amsterdam, and conducted part of her doctoral research at the Ecole des Mines in Paris.

These images remain shocking today and those interested in the history of the Abolition of slavery will recognise many of them. \r\n\r\nBlake was also fervently opposed to all forms of slavery – in particular of one’s own making. In 1807 Parliament abolished the Atlantic trade in slaves. But for Blake slavery was also a mental state. To have limited perceptions, to pursue materialistic ends, to set oneself above others, to follow conventional religion or science was to be enslaved and to be held with ‘mind-forg’d manacles’. This lecture will deal with both actual and mental slavery. \r\n\r\nProfessor Bindman is an art historian and editor of William Blake - The Complete Illuminated Books, other books on Blake, and books on Hogarth, Flaxman, Roubiliac and English attitudes to the French Revolution. He is curating the travelling exhibition organised by the British Museum and the Hayward Gallery to mark the 200th anniversary of the Abolition of the Atlantic Slave Trade by Parliament in 1807. \r\n\r\nThis event is free to all, however, attendees should arrive early, and not bring large bags or suitcases, allowing 20 minutes or more to go through the security checks and scanner.

In this short demonstration lecture we will explore how we actually use all our senses to assess the food we eat. We use our eyes to see the colour, shape and size, our ears to hear any sizzling or crackling, we use our hands to feel the texture, our tongues to sense the taste, our noses to sense the aroma and all the nerves in our mouths to assess the “mouthfeel”. We integrate all these sensations into what we call the “flavour” and then decide whether or not we like it. We will see how the same meat can be prepared and cooked in different ways to give very different flavours and textures. We will show how some flavour combinations work well while others do not. Finally we will show how using items from the science lab can allow us to do things that are otherwise impossible in the kitchen.\r\n\r\nThere will be the opportunity for audience participation in some taste experiments.\r\n\r\nDr Barham, one of the pioneers of the new science of Molecular Gastronomy, has collaborated with Heston Blumenthal (chef proprietor of the Fat Duck).
