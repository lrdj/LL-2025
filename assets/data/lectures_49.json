From the summer of 1941 to 1944, 67,000 of the 75,000 Jews deported from France under Nazi occupation were apprehended in Drancy. Those detained in the improvised, ill-equipped camp were held—from several hours to three years—before being deported ‘east’. The U-shaped concrete complex used was, paradoxically, conceived as a model city, named the Cité de la Muette. A celebrated design in the 1930s promoting a utopian vision for self-contained, integrated community living—the work of French architects Marcel Lods and Eugène Beaudouin—the mass housing building development in Drancy was never completed as expected, and never occupied as intended.\r\n\r\nThis lecture begins by examining the time before the Holocaust, when this targeted area on the periphery of Paris strived to be a place of hope, modernity and progress. Drawing on numerous survivor testimonies, the spatial experiences of those interned in the repurposed internment camp will be discussed. The period following the intervention of war and trauma of deportations, where the Cité de la Muette emerged as a complex site of memory and reflection, will later be explored, including the first permanent memorial placed in the 1970s, the discovery of the Drancy ‘graffiti’ in the 1990s, and the more recently opened purpose-built Drancy Memorial Museum.

A drinks reception will follow this lecture.\r\n\r\nTitle: Teaching Robots to be Agile\r\n\r\nAbstract: This talk will provide an overview of techniques developed in my group to enable robots to react rapidly in the face of changes in the environment when manipulating objects. Learning is guided by observing humans’ exquisite manipulatory skills. I will stress how important it is to model the various ways with which humans perform the same task. This multiplicity of solutions is the key to generate robust and flexible robotic controllers capable of adapting their strategies in the face of unexpected changes in the environment. I will review methods we have developed to allow instantaneous reactions to perturbation, mimicking humans’ immediate response in the presence of danger. I will present applications of these methods for compliant control during human-robot collaborative tasks and for performing sports, such as when playing golf with moving targets. The talk will conclude with examples in which robots achieve super-human capabilities for catching fast moving objects with a dexterity that exceeds that displayed by human beings.\r\n\r\nBiography:Professor Aude Billard is head of the Learning Algorithms and Systems Laboratory (LASA) at the School of Engineering at the EPFL. She received a M.Sc. in Physics from EPFL (1995), a MSc. in Knowledge-based Systems (1996) and a Ph.D. in Artificial Intelligence (1998) from the University of Edinburgh. She was the recipient of the Intel Corporation Teaching award, the Swiss National Science Foundation career award in 2002, the Outstanding Young Person in Science and Innovation from the Swiss Chamber of Commerce and the IEEE-RAS Best Reviewer Award. Her research on human-robot interaction and robot learning from human demonstration was featured in numerous premier venues (BBC, IEEE Spectrum, Wired) and received numerous best paper awards at major robotics conferences, among which ICRA, IROS and ROMAN, as well as the 2015 King-Sun Fu Memorial Award for the best 2014 IEEE Transaction in Robotics paper.\r\n\r\nAll are welcome and attendance is free.

The use of hundreds of wavelengths (colours of light), over, a single fibre, as well as other properties of light: its amplitude, phase and polarization, have led to increases of many orders of magnitude in the optical information carrying capacity. This sparked the communication revolution and the growth of the Internet, and created an illusion of infinite capacity being available.

Migration also allows individuals to escape destitution, human rights abuses, and repressive regimes. Goldin argues that current migration policies are based on misconceptions and fears about migration's long-term contributions and social dynamics and looks at ways that future policies might allow societies to effectively reap migration's opportunities while managing the risks of the twenty-first century.\r\n\r\nThis event celebrates Goldin's latest book Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future.\r\n\r\nIan Goldin is director of the Oxford Martin School, University of Oxford, and professorial fellow at Balliol College, Oxford.

He served on the Bank's senior management team, and was directly responsible for its relationship with the UK and all other European, North American and developed countries. Goldin led the Bank's collaboration with the United Nations and other partners. As Director of Development Policy, Goldin played a pivotal role in the research and strategy agenda of the Bank.\r\n\r\nFrom 1996 to 2001 he was Chief Executive and Managing Director of the Development Bank of Southern Africa and served as an adviser to President Nelson Mandela.

His passions and curiosity have transformed the way we live. In 2007 and again in 2008, Time named him one of the hundred most influential people in the world. To celebrate the publication of his candid and long-awaited memoir Idea Man, Paul Allen comes to the London School of Economics and Political Science to discuss his life of adventure and discovery, from one of the most influential partnerships of the digital era (Microsoft) to the first privately funded spacecraft (SpaceShipOne) to a landmark breakthrough in neuroscience (the Allen Brain Atlas). \r\n\r\nPaul Allen is the billionaire technologist and philanthropist who started Microsoft with Bill Gates. He is founder and chairman of Vulcan Inc., the company that oversees his business and philanthropic activities. \r\n\r\nAllen started Microsoft with Gates, a childhood friend, in Albuquerque in 1975. He was the company's chief technologist until he left in 1983. Since then, Allen has become one of the nation's leading philanthropists and continues the search for knowledge that led to the creation of Microsoft. Allen's multibillion dollar investment portfolio includes a major real estate redevelopment in Seattle's South Lake Union neighborhood and holdings in dozens of technology, media and other companies. He also owns the Seattle Seahawks of the National Football League, the Portland Trail Blazers of the National Basketball Association, and is part of the primary ownership group for the Seattle Sounders FC, the city's Major League Soccer team. \r\n\r\nIn 2004 Allen funded SpaceShipOne, the first privately-backed effort to successfully put a civilian in suborbital space, winning him and designer Burt Rutan the Ansari X-Prize.\r\nHis independent film company, Vulcan Productions, has won numerous awards for feature films and documentaries, including the Emmy-award winning Rx for Survival - A Global Health Challenge; and the Peabody award-winning Judgment Day: Intelligent Design. \r\n\r\nWith lifetime giving of more than $1 billion, Allen has also pledged to leave a majority of his estate to philanthropy. He gives back to the community through the Paul G. Allen Family Foundation, whose goal is to transform individual lives and strengthen communities by supporting arts and culture, youth engagement, community development and social change, and scientific and technological innovation.\r\nIn 2003, the Allen Institute for Brain Science was created with a $100 million commitment from Allen. The Seattle-based Institute is an independent, nonprofit medical research organization dedicated to accelerating our understanding of how the brain works. The Institute takes on projects at the leading edge of science—far-reaching projects at the intersection of biology and technology. The resulting data is available, for free, to researchers worldwide.  \r\n\r\nAllen is also founder of Experience Music Project, Seattle's critically-acclaimed interactive music museum; the Science Fiction Museum and Hall of Fame; and the Flying Heritage Collection, an assemblage of rare World War II aircraft restored to flying condition and shared with the public.\r\n\r\n\r\nSuggested hashtag for this event for Twitter users: #lseideaman \r\n\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 732, "added": "2011-05-03T11:28:41", "slug": "18d76086ba7be31a", "speakers": [{"id": 11055, "name": "Paul  Allen", "slug": "paul-allen"}, {"id": 5959, "name": "Chair: Professor  Saul Estrin", "slug": "chair-professor-saul-estrin"}], "topics": [{"id": 2505, "name": "microsoft", "path": "/business/innovation/microsoft"}, {"id": 2503, "name": "microsoft", "path": "/business/corporate/microsoft"}, {"id": 2504, "name": "microsoft", "path": "/business/current/microsoft"}, {"id": 2501, "name": "microsoft", "path": "/academic/computerscience/web/internet/microsoft"}], "supercategory": "business", "venue": {"id": 2113, "name": "Sheikh Zayed Theatre", "slug": "sheikh-zayed-theatre", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC2A 2AE"}, "organizer": {"id": 1287, "name": "London School of Economics & Political Science", "slug": "london-school-of-economics-political-science"}, "date": "2011-05-05", "dates": [{"id": 10104, "from_date": "2011-05-05", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "18:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": "This event is free and open to all however a ticket is required.

Bach \r\n\r\nCarlos Prieto, Mexican-born and MIT-educated, is one of the most respected cellists in the world, regularly premiering works composed especially for him by Latin American, North American and European composers. Mr. Prieto began playing the cello at age four, studying with the Hungarian cellist Imre Hartman and later with Pierre Fournier in Geneva and Leonard Rose in New York. \r\n\r\nMr. Prieto was a long time friend of Igor Stravinsky. When Stravinsky returned to Russia in 1962 after a fifty-year absence, he was accompanied in Moscow by Mr. Prieto, who was at that time studying in Russia. He also knew Shostakovich and has premiered his first Cello Concerto in different cities in Mexico as well as in Spain. \r\n\r\nMr. Prieto's playing has inspired such rare critical acclaim as \"impeccable\" (The New York Times), \"in true bravura fashion, unafraid, secure, zestful\" (The Boston Globe), \"distinguished music-making\" (San Francisco Chronicle), \"remarkable, razor-sharp\" (The Star-Ledger), and \"impeccable...absolutely gorgeous...breathtaking\" (The St. Louis Post-Dispatch), \"stunning performance\" (The Globe and Mail, Toronto). \r\n\r\nHe has played with orchestras from all over the world, the Royal Philharmonic in London, the Orchestra of the European Union, the American Symphony Orchestra in New York, the Berlin Symphony Orchestra, the Moscow Chamber Orchestra, the St. Petersburg Chamber Orchestra, the Spanish National Orchestra, the Spanish Radio and Television Orchestra, the Irish National Orchestra, National Symphony Orchestra of Argentina, The Simón Bolívar Orchestra of Venezuela, the MAV Budapest Orchestra and many others. \r\n\r\nRemarkable is Carlos Prieto's contribution to the cello repertoire. Since 1980 he has played the world premieres of over 80 compositions, most of which were written for him by the main composers from Mexico, Latin America, Spain and other countries. \r\n\r\nMr. Prieto has played the Bach Suites literally all over the world: twice in New York's Lincoln Center (where he played the complete six suites in one single concert), and in Boston, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Paris, Madrid, Moscow, Beijing, Shanghai, New Delhi, Buenos Aires, Mexico, South America, etc. \r\n\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 60, "image_id": 732, "added": "2010-11-09T13:34:43", "slug": "8c7572bd6644df07", "speakers": [{"id": 10438, "name": "Carlos Prieto", "slug": "carlos-prieto"}], "topics": [{"id": 1474, "name": "culture", "path": "/academic/society/culture/culture"}, {"id": 314, "name": "culture", "path": "/arts/philosophy/culture"}, {"id": 1248, "name": "culture", "path": "/academic/society/culture"}, {"id": 1801, "name": "music", "path": "/business/entertainment/music"}], "supercategory": "academic", "venue": {"id": 2342, "name": "Shaw Library", "slug": "shaw-library", "city": "Houghton Street", "postcode": "WC2A 2AE"}, "organizer": {"id": 1287, "name": "London School of Economics & Political Science", "slug": "london-school-of-economics-political-science"}, "date": "2010-11-25", "dates": [{"id": 9419, "from_date": "2010-11-25", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "18:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": "This event is open to all but a ticket is required.

Wherever large numbers of people gather, contagious disease follows. \r\n\r\nMedical historian Kevin Brown looks at the effects of epidemic disease on the life of Londoners from the Black Death of 1348, through the many subsequent outbreaks of plague, to the opposition to vaccination to deal with smallpox and the cholera epidemics of the nineteenth-century which were to bring about the stirrings of public health reforms that changed the face of London. Find out how Londoners dealt with epidemics through medical remedies, religion, segregation, isolation, plague pits, the persecution of scapegoats and eventually… public health improvements.\r\n\r\nFree, no need to book, no ticket required.

For a programme please visit our website http://harcrhul.wordpress.com or email our HARC administrator Zara Naghizadeh harc@rhul.ac.uk\r\n\r\nThe discussions in both sessions will thus be cross-disciplinary. The issues they will explore bear on fundamental questions such as interpretation, aesthetic form and the way it is experienced, cognitive processes and strategies, and the nature of communication.

There is a good deal of discussion of the relationship between the Jewish character of the state and its democratic character and even the primacy of the state and its institutions to the Zionist project.

The conservation work is ground-breaking and it is the first time such techniques have been used in the UK.\r\n\r\nRepairs carried out by the Victorians and later generations used an unusual range of materials, including cement, terracotta plant pots and bicycle spokes.\r\n\r\nThese previous repairs had started to fail and urgent conservation work was needed to safeguard the pots' future.\r\n\r\nThe 105 vessels included in the conservation project form part of the Bronze Age ceramics collections at Salisbury and South Wiltshire Museum and Wiltshire Heritage Museum, Devizes.\r\n\r\nBoth museums have collections which have been designated as being of national importance by the Museums, Archives and Libraries Council.\r\n\r\nMany of the pots were discovered by three of the most celebrated pioneers of archaeology - Sir Richard Colt Hoare, owner of the Stourhead estate in Wiltshire, his colleague, William Cunnington, and General Augustus Henry Lane-Fox Pitt-Rivers, one of the leading archaeologists and anthropologists of the Victorian age.\r\n\r\nWilliam Snow, Wiltshire County Council's cabinet member for education, said: \"I am delighted that this nationally important conservation project has now been completed.\r\n\r\n\"Conservators at the county council have carried out painstaking work over the last four years to ensure that future generations will be able to see and appreciate these extraordinary ceramics.\r\n\r\n\"The whole point of the project has been to enable the public and researchers to have access to these vessels. If they had not been conserved that would not have been possible.\r\n\r\n\"Many of the conserved ceramics have been back on display at the two museums for some time and I am thrilled that the last of the pots are now ready.\"\r\n\r\nPaul Robinson, curator of Wiltshire Heritage Museum, said: \"This has been a model instance of co-operation between Wiltshire County Council and the two independent museums.\r\n\r\n\"The project also meets the expectations of museum visitors today - that whatever is displayed will be visually appealing and strictly accurate.\"\r\n\r\nPeter Saunders, director of Salisbury and South Wiltshire Museum, said: \"This has been a remarkable project made possible through the collaboration of the Wiltshire County Council conservation centre and the Heritage Lottery Fund.\r\n\r\n\"It is wonderful to see these nationally important Bronze Age vessels restored once again to a condition worthy of public display.\"\r\n\r\nTwo conservators and a subcontractor worked on the project full-time. A large pot with cement to remove could take up to 230 hours to conserve.\r\n\r\nThe processes used included removing cement, rebuilding the pots with modern, sympathetic materials and providing specialist packing for each vessel.\r\n\r\nThe project cost a total of just under £200,000, with the Heritage Lottery Fund providing nearly £150,000. Other funding came from Wiltshire County Council, the two museums involved, the L J Skaggs and Mary C Skaggs Foundation, USA, the South West Museums Council and the American School in London.", "additional_info": null, "duration": null, "image_id": null, "added": "2004-03-23T11:30:00", "slug": "four-year-bronze-age-conservation-project-completion-celebrations", "speakers": [{"id": 120, "name": "Representatives of the museum", "slug": "representatives-of-the-museum"}, {"id": 121, "name": "Representatives of The other museums involved", "slug": "representatives-of-the-other-museums-involved"}], "topics": [{"id": 69, "name": "science", "path": "/science"}], "supercategory": "science", "venue": {"id": 62, "name": "The Megalithic Portal", "slug": "the-megalithic-portal", "city": "n/a", "postcode": "n/a"}, "organizer": {"id": 62, "name": "The Megalithic Portal", "slug": "the-megalithic-portal"}, "date": "2004-03-24", "dates": [{"id": 84, "from_date": "2004-03-24", "to_date": "2004-03-24", "time": "18:30:00", "ticket_cost": "tbc", "ticket_info": null, "additional_info": "The Salisbury and South Wiltshire Museum maintains a \"website\":http://www.salisburymuseum.org.uk/ where you will find details of their other events, exhibitions and lectures.", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 62, "name": "The Megalithic Portal", "slug": "the-megalithic-portal", "city": "n/a", "postcode": "n/a"}, "organizer": {"id": 62, "name": "The Megalithic Portal", "slug": "the-megalithic-portal"}}]}]
