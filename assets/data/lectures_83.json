In it Socrates clashes with the rhetorician Gorgias over the question of his occupation – does it benefit anyone? Does it contribute to a just and good life? What kind of knowledge is required in order to practice rhetoric? What relation does it have to philosophy?  In fact, says Socrates, it may well be likened to a cook who produces delicious sauces with no thought to the health-giving qualities or otherwise of the actual content of the dishes he produces.  This is in contrast to the philosopher, who is interested in the substance of our lives rather than ephemeral questions of transient pleasures.\r\n\r\nIs this fair?

The method proceeds from the premise that the ambition to write creatively presupposes an interest in the ‘expressive mechanics’ of language. A more in-depth understanding of these processes will benefit the writer in many ways, for example by providing them with a precise taxonomy with which to describe various fictional, poetic and dramatic techniques. This will aid detailed analysis of their own and others’ creative work.\r\n\r\nStylistics in general is often taught through presenting theory in conjunction with textual examples. Using it as a tool to aid creative practice reverses the usual paradigm, by encouraging writers to produce creative work in the form of short exercises that exemplify and creatively explore the theory. A ‘two-pronged’ approach is adopted, then, whereby writers are at first introduced to various stylistic and narratological concepts and models (e.g. plot versus narrative, linguistic deviation, deixis, register, focalization, ways of representing thought/speech, and metaphor), then asked to respond to them creatively; for example, an exercise might encourage the use of linguistic deviation to foreground themes and images; another might lead to the deployment of varying types of focalization to tell the same story from different perspectives\r\n\r\nThis lecture will discuss the rationale behind the approach, as well as details of its implementation.

It associates the inadequacies of the governing institutions adopted for the Euro with a set of mythologies that was blind to the presence of distinctive varieties of capitalism in Europe and locates some of the roots of the crisis in the problems associated with combining joining varieties of capitalism in a single currency. The problems encountered by the Euro lie less in the ‘asymmetrical shocks’ anticipated in 1992 and more in the ‘institutional asymmetries’ across political economies. The problems the EU has had in resolving the crisis are also linked to divergent diagnoses of the problem rooted in distinctive philosophies of governance associated again with varieties of capitalism in Europe. \r\n\r\nPeter A.

Decrying the tepid response thus far, he lays out the steps that must be taken to free ourselves and turn around a world economy stagnating in deep recession.

He is a member of President Obama's Cabinet and serves as the President's principal trade advisor, negotiator, and spokesperson on trade issues.  \r\n\r\nSince Ambassador Kirk was confirmed by the U.S. Senate in March 2009, he has led the Obama Administration’s market-opening negotiations and dialogue with trading partners around the world, including the conclusion of bilateral free trade agreements with Korea, Colombia, and Panama, advancing the ambitious regional Trans-Pacific Partnership talks, and sustaining serious U.S. engagement at the World Trade Organization. \r\n\r\nAmbassador Kirk has also simultaneously pursued robust enforcement of America's trade rights in support of U.S. businesses and workers, and he has focused efforts to better assist American small businesses seeking opportunities in international markets. \r\n\r\nAmbassador Kirk brings both public service and private sector experience to USTR.

It was founded by Emperor Susenyos (r. 1607–32) and became a major political and religious centre during his reign and that of his son, Emperor Fasilidas (r. 1632–67). It has close links with the important monastery of Debre Libanos.\r\n\r\nIn 1532 Debre Libanos was burnt by the Muslim forces of El-Gragn and the community of monks fled north. They wandered along the shore of Lake Tana till eventually Emperor Fasilidas settled the community in Azezo where the monastery of Debre Libanos of Shewa was re-established. During the Mahdist invasion of Gondar in 1889 the church of Tekle Haymanot was partially destroyed. However, restoration took place during HIM Haile Selassie’s reign and the paintings now seen on the walls of the maqdas were executed in 1960 EC (1966–67 AD) by Alaqa Nekea Tibeb Bekure Tsion from Gondar.\r\n\r\nAbuna Basilewos (1883–1970), the first Ethiopian patriarch, had been consecrated abuna in January 1951. He had also been the echege of Debre Libanos since 1934 and therefore Tekle Haymanot was his spiritual mentor. Here the story comes full circle – Abuna and Emperor together visit Azezo to pay tribute to Saint Tekle Haymanot and to inaugurate the new paintings. The event is depicted in a painting on the east wall and on the west wall of the maqdas.\r\n\r\nThe cycle of paintings is extremely rich and carefully executed. The walls of the maqdas are tall and divided into seven registers, allowing for a wealth of iconography to be displayed not usually seen in other churches.

For Lord Bingham, the rule of law is a means of maintaining order - among the people, the government and business… and as he was the first judge to hold the posts of Master of the Rolls, Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, and Senior Law Lord of the United Kingdom, he knows a thing or two about it.\r\n\r\nLord Bingham argues that judges, in order to maximise the fairness of their decision-making, should seek to ‘neutralise any extraneous considerations which might bias their judgement’. Given that they’re predominently Establishment figures, is this demand for judges’ impartiality simply wishful thinking? Is the Law really a ‘unifying factor’ as Bingham asserts, or is it a contractual relation that creates an ‘us and them’?\r\n\r\nAt this Bookshop Barnie, held in conjunction with Foyles Bookshop, we will examine whether the Rule of Law is sufficient to develop and progress liberal democracy; or is primarily a means of protecting and preserving it. You do not need to have read the book beforehand - as a matter of fact you are discouraged from doing so - so that you can come and be convinced (or otherwise) by the good Lord’s arguments.

He then moved on to serve several leadership roles at the group level, firstly as Worldwide Head of Customer Delivery and later as Group Head, Worldwide Sales and Customer Delivery. Over the years, Shibu has been known to foster innovation, leadership, teamwork and work values within the organisation. \r\n\r\nOn June 22, 2007, Shibu took over from S.

Vehemently attacked by most clergymen, emphatically endorsed by some, astrology has many competing proponents, and faced, in 1652, a challenge, a timely opportunity to prove itself: Annus tenebrosus, the 'dark year', with a major solar eclipse and two lunar eclipses anticipated.This lecture will examine the difficult situation of the nation’s pre-eminent astrologer, William Lilly, as he faced this set of circumstances; describe why and how he interpreted the potential effects of the Black Monday solar eclipse in the way he did, what happened on the day itself, and the effects on Lilly’s contemporary reputation and for astrology as a whole.

She shows how he leveraged business contacts with men like the anti-slavery campaigner Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton and the Irish nationalist Daniel O’Connell to bring Jews into the mainstream of British politics during the era of slave emancipation and the Great Reform Act. The alliance Montefiore forged with the evangelical and dissenting middle classes in the name of ‘civil and religious liberty’ would enable Montefiore to engage a broad political coalition in support of international Jewish relief as a humanitarian cause during the Damascus Affair of 1840 and the decades that followed.\r\n\r\nAbigail Green is Tutor and Fellow in Modern History at Brasenose College, Oxford.

Roger Pielke Jr, claims that the science of the IPCC’s (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) report is based on cherry-picked data, whereas Bob Ward argues that the link between extreme weather events and climate change is clear  and the row  over the evidence for increasing losses from disasters is an excuse to dig up old criticisms and is ‘predictable opportunism’.

Few doubt that it is the major issue facing humanity in the 21st Century. Due to the magnitude of the problem and its consequences, it is no surprise that debate about the extent of its effects and the best solutions has become a hot topic in the media.\r\n\r\nA report in The Sunday Times on 24 January claimed that the United Nations climate science panel (IPCC) wrongly linked global warming to an increase in the number and severity of natural disasters such as hurricanes and floods. Politicians took this message into the mainstream, with President Barack Obama, saying last autumn: ‘More powerful storms and floods threaten every continent.’, but was this based on sound science?\r\n\r\nThis debate has continued ever since, both in the media and online, with two climate experts coming head-to-head. Roger Pielke Junior, a professor of environmental studies at the University of Colorado, has attacked the IPCC for including in one of its reports a reference to an abstract in 2006, that indicated economic losses from disasters increased between 1970 and 2005. Bob Ward, policy and communications Director of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the environment at the London School of Economics and Political Science, claims the link between extreme weather events and climate change is clear, and that criticisms about the evidence for an increase in disaster losses is nothing new and is merely a repetition of criticisms that date back to 2006 because the IPCC's procedures for reviewing scientific work is currently under the spotlight.\r\n\r\nWe are delighted that these two leading figures in this discussion have agreed to a debate at short notice here at the Royal Institution, which will be chaired by the BBC's Science and Environment correspondent David Shukman, so come along to join in the conversation about a key issue for the future of the planet.", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": null, "added": "2010-02-02T16:16:07", "slug": "b8270b01a349b372", "speakers": [{"id": 9351, "name": "Bob Ward", "slug": "bob-ward"}, {"id": 9352, "name": "Prof Roger Pielke Jr", "slug": "prof-roger-pielke-jr"}], "topics": [{"id": 868, "name": "climate", "path": "/science/climatechange/climate"}, {"id": 1992, "name": "change", "path": "/politics/economics/change"}, {"id": 1925, "name": "global", "path": "/academic/global"}], "supercategory": "science", "venue": {"id": 2, "name": "The Royal Institution of Great Britain", "slug": "the-royal-institution-of-great-britain", "city": "London", "postcode": "W1S 4BS"}, "organizer": {"id": 2, "name": "The Royal Institution of Great Britain", "slug": "the-royal-institution-of-great-britain"}, "date": "2010-02-05", "dates": [{"id": 8113, "from_date": "2010-02-05", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "19:00:00", "ticket_cost": "Tickets cost £8 standard, £6 concession, £4 Ri Members", "ticket_info": "www.rigb.org or by calling the Events team on 020 7409 2992 9.00am-5.00pm Monday to Friday.", "additional_info": null, "members_only": "No", "members_info": "Available through the website, www.rigb.org.\r\n", "venue": {"id": 2, "name": "The Royal Institution of Great Britain", "slug": "the-royal-institution-of-great-britain", "city": "London", "postcode": "W1S 4BS"}, "organizer": {"id": 2, "name": "The Royal Institution of Great Britain", "slug": "the-royal-institution-of-great-britain"}}]}, {"id": 7696, "title": "The End of the Great British Fish Dish?", "synopsis": "Has fish had its chips?

While old forms of community and solidarity have waned, leaving us apparently more fragmented and individualised, the social web enables many of us to work, play and organise with others in ways previously unimaginable. Technologies like Flickr, Delicious, Wikipedia and LINUX evidence new means of sharing information and working together. Many suggest these technologies will have far-reaching social implications, and even presage a new form of production and work outside the market system. While traditional free market capitalism is compromised by the worldwide recession, the world wide web is said to promise an exciting alternative. Wired’s Kevin Kelly suggests we are entering a new collectivist epoch, a ‘New Socialism’. Technology guru Howard Rheingold sees these developments as disruptive, and will change the way people ‘meet, mate, work, fight, buy, sell’. Charles Leadbeater, author of We-Think, sees the new means of networked collaboration as presaging a new production model: ‘Mass Innovation rather than Mass Production’. \r\n\r\nThere are challenges to the optimists, though. What about privacy and authorship, if innovations, ideas and information are open to all? Does ‘sharing’ our photos, ideas, and writing open up egalitarian and creative possibilities, or merely allow multinational corporations to take advantage of free labour and have access to our intellectual property? Cory Doctorow argues we are in danger of becoming IP serfs having to pay to access ideas which should be freely available, and champions a ‘creative commons’ as a bulwark against this trend.\r\n\r\nCan and should these new forms of production be regulated? If so, by whom and how? Is new technology really a utopian challenge to the market, or merely more of the same in virtual space? Can the profound problems of social fragmentation and an economic system in crisis be resolved by sharing technologies and collaborating and innovating with online ‘friends’? \r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 120, "image_id": 1239, "added": "2009-09-18T09:37:28", "slug": "the-future-of-collaboration-sharing-and-work-in-the-networked-age", "speakers": [{"id": 8787, "name": "Michael Bull", "slug": "michael-bull"}, {"id": 8788, "name": "Cory Doctorow", "slug": "cory-doctorow"}, {"id": 2164, "name": "Nico Macdonald", "slug": "nico-macdonald"}], "topics": [{"id": 1573, "name": "media", "path": "/society/media/media/media"}, {"id": 1043, "name": "internet", "path": "/arts/business/internet"}, {"id": 1415, "name": "internet", "path": "/business/marketing/internet"}, {"id": 535, "name": "media", "path": "/arts/theatre/media"}], "supercategory": "society", "venue": {"id": 2054, "name": "Jubilee Library", "slug": "jubilee-library", "city": "Brighton and Hove", "postcode": "BN1 1GE"}, "organizer": {"id": 45, "name": "Institute of Ideas", "slug": "institute-of-ideas"}, "date": "2009-09-25", "dates": [{"id": 7510, "from_date": "2009-09-25", "to_date": "2009-09-25", "time": "9:00:00", "ticket_cost": "£7.50 (£5)", "ticket_info": "http://www.battleofideas.org.uk/index.php/2009/session_detail/2691/", "additional_info": "http://www.battleofideas.org.uk/index.php/2009/session_detail/2691/", "members_only": "No", "members_info": "Join the Institute of Ideas: www.instituteofideas.com", "venue": {"id": 2054, "name": "Jubilee Library", "slug": "jubilee-library", "city": "Brighton and Hove", "postcode": "BN1 1GE"}, "organizer": {"id": 45, "name": "Institute of Ideas", "slug": "institute-of-ideas"}}]}, {"id": 6921, "title": "A guide to law and business practice for designers", "synopsis": "This seminar will give you an overview of intellectual property rights relevant to your design business", "keywords": "intellectual property, design, designers, makers, artists, creative businesses, law, copyright, licensing, contracts", "body": "\r\nDate: \t23rd September 2009\r\nTime: \t6-9pm (presentations from 6-8pm followed by networking until 8.45pm)\r\n\r\nLocation:\r\nInnovation Centre/Conference Room (entrance on Red Lion Square), Central Saint Martins, Southampton Row, London, WC1B 4AP\r\n\r\nPlease click here for directions: http://tinyurl.com/2gokp8\r\n\r\nSuccess as a designer doesn’t solely depend on your talent or brilliant ideas.

Some are of clear economic importance, many are emphasised in conservation legislation, and in total river ecosystems deliver critical goods and services on which people depend throughout the world.  At the same time, rivers are at risk from a wide range of pressures that arise at multiple scales.  As resources, they are affected by impairments directly to the river channel (e.g. point source pollution, abstraction), by alteration of the riparian zone, and by changes in catchment land use.  In this respect, they are among the most sensitive of all ecosystems to human modification, and evidence suggests that extinction rates for river organisms are at least as rapid as those in tropical rainforest.\r\nIn this lecture, Steve will offer a range of examples that illustrate the extent of impairment to river ecosystems in tropical and temperate locations, and reveal also the difficulties of restoring rivers once they are impacted:  by acidification, climate change, catchment conversion to agriculture, etc.  Steve will discuss the opportunities and challenges of positive management which can balance the value of rivers as resources that must inevitably be exploited, and features of major conservation importance.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteve Ormerod is Professor of Ecology, Cardiff School of Biosciences.  He is also President of the Institute of Ecology and Environmental Management,  Chairman of RSPB Wales,  Trustee of the RSPB,  Trustee of Association of Rivers' Trusts,  Trustee of South East Wales Rivers Trust\r\nWith over 25 years experience and over 220 scientific publications, Steve is one of Europe’s leading freshwater ecologists.  His work focuses on large-scale, multi-disciplinary problems affecting freshwater biodiversity, ecosystem quality and function, and he is known best for flagship studies on the effects of acid rain, land use and climate-change on aquatic insects and river birds.  \r\nLandmark studies have included some of the first field-validated models of the ecological effects of acid rain, land use and climate change on river organisms. His group were among the first to develop biological indicators of river acidification and provided the world’s first evidence that birds could be affected.  Investigations continue to address the problems of acid episodes in headwaters, the ecology of priority organisms, climate change effects on species and ecological function and multi-scale influences on species distribution.  Key work has also included an extensive 10-year programme of assessment of resource quality in Himalayan rivers.\r\nSteve is widely known in research and end-user communities.  Current and recent positions include executive editorship of the Journal of Applied Ecology, board members of ‘Freshwater Biology’ and ‘Aquatic Conservation’, member of Council of the Freshwater Biological Association, co-ordinating peer-reviewer of Defra’s ‘Biodiversity and Agriculture Research Programme’, numerous advisory panels of the Environment Agency, Irish Environmental Protection Agency and the Institut Français de la Biodiversité.   He has been a member of the Countryside Council for Wales, the UK Acid Waters Review Group (DoE), Critical Loads Advisory Group (DETR) and the National Expert Group on Transboundary Air Pollution (DETR).  \r\n\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 120, "image_id": null, "added": "2009-01-24T01:18:31", "slug": "32dd8ff21749d954", "speakers": [{"id": 7996, "name": "Professor Steve Ormerod", "slug": "professor-steve-ormerod"}], "topics": [{"id": 427, "name": "ecology", "path": "/arts/architecture/ecology"}, {"id": 752, "name": "conservation", "path": "/science/naturalhistory/conservation"}, {"id": 924, "name": "conservation", "path": "/academic/naturalhistory/conservation"}, {"id": 1002, "name": "conservation", "path": "/leisure/conservation/conservation"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 487, "name": "Birkbeck College", "slug": "birkbeck-college", "city": "LONDON", "postcode": "WC1E 7HX"}, "organizer": {"id": 1069, "name": "Ecology and Conservation Studies Society", "slug": "ecology-and-conservation-studies-society"}, "date": "2009-02-13", "dates": [{"id": 6692, "from_date": "2009-02-13", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "18:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": "E-mail: environmentevents@FLL.bbk.ac.uk  for booking and venue details, (telephone  020 7679 1069)", "additional_info": "Booking essential", "members_only": "No", "members_info": "Details of the Society and application forms will be available at the door, and are on our website http://www.bbk.ac.uk/ce/environment/ecssociety/index.shtml", "venue": {"id": 487, "name": "Birkbeck College", "slug": "birkbeck-college", "city": "LONDON", "postcode": "WC1E 7HX"}, "organizer": {"id": 1069, "name": "Ecology and Conservation Studies Society", "slug": "ecology-and-conservation-studies-society"}}]}, {"id": 5930, "title": "The Importance of the Grosvenor Museum & the Geological History of Cheshire", "synopsis": "Professor Cynthia Burek takes a look at the Museum and its Geological collection", "keywords": "Geology", "body": null, "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": null, "added": "2009-01-14T02:00:33", "slug": "the-importance-of-the-grosvenor-museum-the-geological-history-of-cheshire", "speakers": [{"id": 6812, "name": "Professor Cynthia Burek", "slug": "professor-cynthia-burek"}], "topics": [{"id": 228, "name": "geology", "path": "/science/geology"}], "supercategory": "science", "venue": {"id": 331, "name": "Grosvenor Museum", "slug": "grosvenor-museum", "city": "Chester", "postcode": "CH1 2DD"}, "organizer": {"id": 331, "name": "Grosvenor Museum", "slug": "grosvenor-museum"}, "date": "2009-01-14", "dates": [{"id": 6220, "from_date": "2009-01-14", "to_date": "2009-01-14", "time": "19:30:00", "ticket_cost": "members free, non members £4 ,students £2", "ticket_info": "on the door", "additional_info": null, "members_only": "No", "members_info": "GMS Membership £10 individuals - £15 family subscription", "venue": {"id": 331, "name": "Grosvenor Museum", "slug": "grosvenor-museum", "city": "Chester", "postcode": "CH1 2DD"}, "organizer": {"id": 331, "name": "Grosvenor Museum", "slug": "grosvenor-museum"}}]}, {"id": 6104, "title": "Bureaucrats, Brothels and the Business of Aids", "synopsis": "Listen to the expert behind the statistics on Aids and HIV.

Cartoon illustration is also part of the visual vocabulary of many artists working in other media such as painting, sculpture and commercial graphics. Sparkling guest speakers look at the subject from a range of perspectives &#8211; as practising illustrators and artists, writers, curators and art specialists.  \r\n\r\nThe day will be chaired by Stephen Calloway, Curator in Prints and the Book Section of the Word & Image Department, V&A and complements the V&A Illustration Awards, the premier awards for book and editorial illustration in the UK. The award-winning entries will be announced on 1 December 2004 and then displayed at the V&A until 27 February 2005. The V&A is keen to promote illustration, and has outstanding collections that are freely accessible to everyone.\r\n\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 480, "image_id": 46, "added": "2004-08-25T15:57:29", "slug": "laughter-lines-humour-in-illustration", "speakers": [{"id": 1416, "name": "Stephen Calloway", "slug": "stephen-calloway"}, {"id": 1417, "name": "Emma Laws", "slug": "emma-laws"}, {"id": 1418, "name": "Chris Beetles", "slug": "chris-beetles"}, {"id": 1419, "name": "Posy Simmonds", "slug": "posy-simmonds"}, {"id": 606, "name": "David Shrigley", "slug": "david-shrigley"}], "topics": [{"id": 296, "name": "collecting", "path": "/arts/collecting"}, {"id": 245, "name": "comedy", "path": "/arts/comedy"}, {"id": 7, "name": "books", "path": "/arts/books"}, {"id": 6, "name": "arts", "path": "/arts"}, {"id": 178, "name": "design", "path": "/arts/design"}, {"id": 89, "name": "literature", "path": "/arts/literature"}, {"id": 390, "name": "media", "path": "/arts/media"}, {"id": 86, "name": "historyofart", "path": "/arts/historyofart"}, {"id": 187, "name": "cartoon", "path": "/arts/cartoon"}, {"id": 284, "name": "humour", "path": "/arts/books/humour"}, {"id": 492, "name": "bookillustration", "path": "/arts/books/bookillustration"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 177, "name": "Victoria and Albert Museum (learning)", "slug": "victoria-and-albert-museum-learning", "city": "London", "postcode": "SW7 2RL"}, "organizer": {"id": 177, "name": "Victoria and Albert Museum (learning)", "slug": "victoria-and-albert-museum-learning"}, "date": "2004-11-20", "dates": [{"id": 1212, "from_date": "2004-11-20", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "10:30:00", "ticket_cost": "£36.00, concessions apply", "ticket_info": "To book call 0207 942 2211 or visit the V&A website at www.vam.ac.uk.", "additional_info": "Concessionary rates: senior citizens, Friends and Patrons of the V&A: £30.
