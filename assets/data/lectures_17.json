What had been a minor regional school achieved international prominence and influenced the future of European art in general for centuries. Central to this achievement was the genius of a succession of painters from Giovanni Bellini and his brother Gentile, Carpaccio, Giorgione, to the great Titian and his younger contemporaries Tintoretto and Veronese. These painters worked in a city undergoing crisis and change: the decline of its maritime empire, the reduction of its monopoly of trade with the East, its near destruction as a state in the early sixteenth century, and the religious turmoil engendered by the Reformation and the reaction of the Roman Church to it. Governed by an oligarchy of merchant nobles who elected a Doge, Venice remained politically stable throughout this turbulent period and continued to flourish economically. The state, the lay confraternities (called scuole) and private individuals provided sufficient patronage and support for a brilliant school of painting to develop in both secular and religious art. The cultural context and history of this school will be studied in eight lectures, followed by a full-day visit to the National Gallery to consider first-hand its outstanding collection of Venetian renaissance paintings.\r\n \r\n\r\n", "keywords": "arts, art, history, Renaissance Venice", "body": "Why did Renaissance Venice give rise to one of the greatest traditions of painting in the entire history of art?

Its class system, sources of wealth and civic institutions will be shown to be central to its cultural achievements. The different categories of patronage in the city will be discussed, as will the ways in which painters could benefit from these sources of employment.

He locates the 2008 financial crisis in US attempts to block China's model of development. He shows how Europe and the US conspire with regional dictators to prevent countries from developing advanced industries, and how this system has fed terrorism. \r\n\r\nMehta argues that a different world is possible, based on policies of disarmament, demilitarisation and sustainable development. This original and thought-provoking book will be of great interest to anyone concerned about the consequences of endless war fuelled by the West.\r\nVijay Mehta is a renowned author, international speaker and global activist for peace, development and human rights.

The first lesson taught by physically tasting war is that ruination is the essence of all being: Death has no meaning and anything solid can be reduced to nothing in seconds. The learning of this process of vanishing, this morphing of matter to dust, of something into nothing, has led me to conclude that ruination, or destruction is hidden de facto in the phenomenon of figuration. Thus, for the last five years I have explored the space located between figuration and abstraction, between existing and vanishing, a concept which for me also holds deep spiritual meaning.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that the technical aspects of my practice include the burning, distressing and obliterating of material: I have termed this Ruins Technique.

nationalism in its different aspects—ideas, sentiments, and politics. Every chapter takes the form of an interpretative essay which, by a combination of thematic focus, comparison, and regional perspective, enables the reader to understand nationalism as a distinct and global historical subject. \r\n\r\nThe book covers the emergence of nationalist ideas, sentiments, and cultural movements before the formation of a world of nationstates, as well as nationalist politics before and after the era of the nation-state, with chapters covering Europe, the Middle East, North-East Asia, South Asia, South-East Asia, Sub- Saharan Africa, and the Americas. Essays on everyday national sentiment and race ideas in fascism are accompanied by chapters on nationalist movements opposed to existing nation-states, nationalism and international relations, and the role of external intervention into nationalist disputes within states. In addition, the book looks at the major challenges\r\nto nationalism: international socialism, religion, pan-nationalism, and globalization,\r\nbefore a final section considering how historians have approached the subject\r\nof nationalism. \r\n\r\nJohn Breuilly is professor of nationalism and ethnicity at LSE. \r\n\r\nDr Faisal Devji is reader in Indian History, St. Antony's College, University of Oxford. \r\n\r\nDr Mark Hewitson is senior lecturer in German History and Politics in the Department of German at University College London. \r\n\r\nThis event will be followed by a reception in the Senior Common Room, 5th Floor, Old Building.\r\n\r\nEvent Weblisting: http://www2.lse.ac.uk/publicEvents/events/2013/03/20130313t1830vHKT.aspx\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 732, "added": "2013-01-14T23:34:06", "slug": "7939ea04e851a9d4", "speakers": [{"id": 5995, "name": "Professor John Breuilly", "slug": "professor-john-breuilly"}, {"id": 13384, "name": "Dr Faisal Devji", "slug": "dr-faisal-devji"}, {"id": 13385, "name": "Dr Mark Hewitson", "slug": "dr-mark-hewitson"}], "topics": [{"id": 2692, "name": "history", "path": "/arts/finearts/film/film/history"}, {"id": 106, "name": "wwi", "path": "/arts/books/history/military/wwi"}, {"id": 107, "name": "wwii", "path": "/arts/books/history/military/wwii"}, {"id": 108, "name": "army", "path": "/arts/books/history/military/army"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 2133, "name": "Hong Kong Theatre", "slug": "hong-kong-theatre", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC2A 2AE"}, "organizer": {"id": 1287, "name": "London School of Economics & Political Science", "slug": "london-school-of-economics-political-science"}, "date": "2013-03-13", "dates": [{"id": 12519, "from_date": "2013-03-13", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "18:30:00", "ticket_cost": "FREE", "ticket_info": "This event is free and open to all with no ticket required.

In addition, they also show how productivity analysis for decentralized services can include salient and managerially useful variables, looking at how IT and management modernization help shape the productivity of NHS hospitals. The first rule of productivity growth in public services is to focus hard on consistently measuring and improving productivity performance. The second rule is to embrace IT modernization carried out in tandem with genuinely effective and well-considered business process reorganization.  \r\n\r\nThis lecture will discuss ideas for the improvement of public sector productivity from a local, national and international government perspective.  \r\n\r\nLeandro Carrera is a senior researcher at the Pensions Policy Institute. \r\n\r\nPatrick Dunleavy is professor of political science and public policy at LSE. \r\n\r\nJoe Grice is chief economist at the Office for National Statistics.  \r\n\r\nEdwin Lau is head of the Reform of the Public Sector Division in the OECD Public Governance and Territorial Development Directorate. \r\n\r\nBarry Quirk is chief executive at the London Borough of Lewisham. \r\n\r\nLSE Public Policy Group (PPG)| is an independent consultancy and research organisation.  \r\n\r\nPPG provides thorough analysis and recommendations for a variety of clients; providing an interface between academia, the private, public and 'third' sector. \r\n\r\nLSE Works| is a series of public lectures, that will showcase some of the latest research by LSE's Research Centres.

Some readers are shocked by Kierkegaard’s apparent approval of Abraham’s readiness to sacrifice his son at God’s command, especially as this suggests alarming parallels with the actions of religious terrorists.  However, careful reading of Fear and Trembling shows that this response is too hasty.\r\n\r\n This lecture will examine the important – but often overlooked – role of courage in Kierkegaard’s account of Abraham’s faith.  Courage is one of the traditional ethical virtues, but for Kierkegaard a certain kind of courage has a special place in the Christian life.  However, this virtue is not confined to a religious context.  Fear and Trembling emphasises features of human existence that call for courage: finitude, vulnerability, uncertainty, and deep attachments to other mortal beings.  For Kierkegaard, it takes courage to love another person, and this makes it a universal human virtue.  In fact, living without God may require even more courage than living with belief in God.  Furthermore, in our present age the fast pace of change and the dissolution of traditional shared values make courage more important than ever for those who want to hold on to the idea of an ethical life.\r\n\r\nClaire Carlisle's (KCL) research interests converge at the interface between Philosophy and Theology: she is currently working on the philosophy of habit; Spinoza's ontology; and Kierkegaard's phenomenology of religious life.  She is a member of the British Society for the History of Philosophy, and the Søren Kierkegaard Society of the UK.\r\n\r\n\r\n", "keywords": "Philosophy, Religion, Courage", "body": null, "additional_info": null, "duration": 120, "image_id": null, "added": "2011-10-27T16:08:00", "slug": "847f5cf37cdf65f8", "speakers": [{"id": 5724, "name": "Dr Clare Carlisle", "slug": "dr-clare-carlisle"}], "topics": [{"id": 1821, "name": "religion", "path": "/academic/religion/religion/religion"}, {"id": 2129, "name": "religion", "path": "/arts/history/religion/religion"}, {"id": 1822, "name": "philosophy", "path": "/academic/religion/religion/philosophy"}, {"id": 2388, "name": "philosophy", "path": "/arts/literature/philosophy/philosophy"}], "supercategory": "academic", "venue": {"id": 704, "name": "Conway Hall", "slug": "conway-hall", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC1R 4RL"}, "organizer": {"id": 704, "name": "Conway Hall", "slug": "conway-hall"}, "date": "2011-11-13", "dates": [{"id": 10760, "from_date": "2011-11-13", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "11:00:00", "ticket_cost": "£3 on the door/free to SPES members.", "ticket_info": null, "additional_info": null, "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 704, "name": "Conway Hall", "slug": "conway-hall", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC1R 4RL"}, "organizer": {"id": 704, "name": "Conway Hall", "slug": "conway-hall"}}]}, {"id": 10186, "title": "Thomas Mawson, Life, Gardens and Landscapes (Frances Lincoln) Soetemi Horiguchi (forthcoming)", "synopsis": "Janet Waymark Thomas Mawson, Life, Gardens and Landscapes (Frances Lincoln) Soetemi Horiguchi (forthcoming)", "keywords": "C20 Society", "body": "Part of the Landscapes and Gardens:  new looks, new books series", "additional_info": null, "duration": 120, "image_id": null, "added": "2011-09-26T14:32:05", "slug": "thomas-mawson-life-gardens-and-landscapes-frances-lincoln-soetemi-horiguchi-forthcoming", "speakers": [{"id": 11558, "name": "Jane Waymark", "slug": "jane-waymark"}], "topics": [{"id": 687, "name": "society", "path": "/arts/architecture/planning/society"}, {"id": 1024, "name": "society", "path": "/arts/literature/french/society"}, {"id": 123, "name": "mobility", "path": "/society/urbanisation/planning/mobility"}, {"id": 405, "name": "society", "path": "/arts/politics/society"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 1790, "name": "The Gallery", "slug": "the-gallery", "city": "London", "postcode": "EC1M 6EJ"}, "organizer": {"id": 1788, "name": "Twentieth Century Society", "slug": "twentieth-century-society"}, "date": "2011-11-03", "dates": [{"id": 10605, "from_date": "2011-11-03", "to_date": "2011-11-03", "time": "18:30:00", "ticket_cost": "£9 non-members, £5 students, £7 members", "ticket_info": "www.c20society.org.uk", "additional_info": null, "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 1790, "name": "The Gallery", "slug": "the-gallery", "city": "London", "postcode": "EC1M 6EJ"}, "organizer": {"id": 1788, "name": "Twentieth Century Society", "slug": "twentieth-century-society"}}]}, {"id": 10019, "title": "The Better Angels of our Nature: The Decline of Violence in World History and Its Causes", "synopsis": "LSE public lecture", "keywords": "Pyschology, society, murder, warfare, war, LSE, progress, violent", "body": "One of the world's best-known psychologists argues that violence within and between societies - both murder and warfare - has declined from prehistory to today.

Is it a sum-total of DNA or a more subtle configuration of individual talent and the historical moment?", "keywords": "Genius, Genetics, Talent", "body": "From Bach to the Beatles, the image of the prodigious genius effortlessly composing masterpiece after masterpiece holds a romantic sway over the popular imagination. Whether one believes Kierkegaard when he says, ‘geniuses are like thunderstorms…they go against the wind, terrify people, cleanse the air,’ or Schopenhauer’s claim that ‘genius aims at sights that others can’t see’, artistic genius tends to be regarded as a special force of nature, which makes the extraordinary look ordinary. With that comes the acceptance that geniuses don’t play by the same rules as ordinary folk: what else other than their sublime talent could allow us to enjoy the work despite Wagner’s anti-Semitism, Ezra Pound’s involvement with fascism or Phil Spector’s conviction for murder?\r\n\r\nYet while works of genius are notoriously hard to define, geneticists argue we are moving closer to decoding the talent gene, whilst a link is regularly drawn between genius and autism or other mental disorders. As a counter to this apparently deterministic view, books such as David Shenk’s The Genius in All of Us, Malcolm Gladwell’s Outliers and Geoff Colvin’s Talent is Overrated seemingly confirm Edison’s intuition that genius – whether on the sports field or in the conservatoire and exhibition space - really is 1% inspiration and 99% (or 10,000 hours of) perspiration. Yet with the inspiration behind genius so often claimed to stem from intense spiritual devotion or an obsessive quest for aesthetic perfection – both seemingly anathema to rationalist, secular 21st century society – some doubt modern Western culture will ever again be able to produce a true genius capable of standing above his or her contemporaries in the way previous generations have.\r\n\r\nWhat do we understand by genius in the 21st century? Is it a sum-total of DNA or a more subtle configuration of individual talent and the historical moment? Is genius something that is of its time or outside of it? What part does society play in the formation of genius and what potential does our current society have for ‘standing on the shoulder of giants’ and nurturing the geniuses of the future?

This book is the result of a seven-year odyssey among Native people, listening to their philosophies; meeting cannibals; anchoring a boat to an iceberg where polar bears slept; joining Inuit hunters on a whale hunt; drinking shamanic medicine with Amazonian healers; visiting sea gypsies and journeying to the freedom fighters of West Papua.\r\n\r\nShe will discuss the songlines of the earth, the paths in the Papuan highlands remembered in song, and the ethereal music of shamans, as well as the songlines of Aboriginal Australia.  The talk will explore the words and meanings which shape ideas of wildness and it will illustrate the anarchic nature of wildness, as well as the kindness of what is wild, both in nature and the human mind. The talk will also explore some of the political resonances of wilderness and the corporate invasions of indigenous lands, arguing for the essential freedoms, and the necessary wildness of the human spirit, everywhere. \r\n\r\nJay Griffiths is the author of two works of non-fiction “Wild: An Elemental Journey” and “Pip Pip: A Sideways Look at Time”.  She has also written a long short story, “Anarchipelago” based on the road protest movement of the 1990s.

Ben Goldacre is a writer, broadcaster and medical doctor from the UK who is best known for his 'Bad Science' column in The Guardian newspaper, examining the claims of scaremongering journalists, quack health products, pseudoscientific cosmetics adverts, and evil multinational pharmaceutical corporations, as well as wider themes such as the medicalisation of everyday life and the psychology of irrational beliefs.\r\n\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 480, "image_id": null, "added": "2008-12-08T03:48:58", "slug": "weird-science", "speakers": [{"id": 1470, "name": "Prof Richard Wiseman", "slug": "prof-richard-wiseman"}, {"id": 6234, "name": "Professor   Chris French", "slug": "professor-chris-french"}, {"id": 7757, "name": "Dr Stephen Law", "slug": "dr-stephen-law"}, {"id": 4741, "name": "Dr Ben Goldacre", "slug": "dr-ben-goldacre"}], "topics": [{"id": 65, "name": "religion", "path": "/religion"}, {"id": 69, "name": "science", "path": "/science"}], "supercategory": "religion", "venue": {"id": 1072, "name": "Conway Hall", "slug": "conway-hall", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC1R 4RL"}, "organizer": {"id": 1619, "name": "Center for Inquiry London", "slug": "center-for-inquiry-london"}, "date": "2009-01-17", "dates": [{"id": 6478, "from_date": "2009-01-17", "to_date": "2009-01-17", "time": "10:30:00", "ticket_cost": "£10 for lecture", "ticket_info": "slalvani@centerforinquiry.net", "additional_info": "http://www.cfilondon.org \r\nwill give full instructions including how to pay", "members_only": "No", "members_info": "Become a Friend of CFI London\r\nhttp://www.cfilondon.org", "venue": {"id": 1072, "name": "Conway Hall", "slug": "conway-hall", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC1R 4RL"}, "organizer": {"id": 1619, "name": "Center for Inquiry London", "slug": "center-for-inquiry-london"}}]}, {"id": 6141, "title": "A 19th Century Gay Pagan", "synopsis": "The Spirituality and Life of Edward Carpenter", "keywords": "homosexuality, queer, pagan 19th century", "body": "One tends to think of the pagan revival as a 20th-century phenomenon, but in fact the 19th century had a handful of dedicated seekers whose spirituality would speak clearly to pagans today. Edward Carpenter (1844-1929) was one of these, and tonight introduces him and his beliefs. He was not only pagan but a radical; a socialist, an anarchist, a vegetarian, and a homosexual who left his privileged background to live with his working-class male lover at the very time of Oscar Wilde's prosecution. He is a forefather to many: gay people, leftist visionaries, anarchists, and -- as Dr Alexander will show in this lecture -- pagans. She will illuminate Carpenter's vision: collective cosmic consciousness; sexual liberation; political commitment to the liberation of the human condition; and metaphysical commitment to seeking union with nature. Carpenter's ideas are relevant to pagans today, perhaps more than ever before. Come see if you agree.\r\n\r\nJenny Alexander is an engaging and provocative lecturer. She wrote her doctoral thesis on nineteenth-century anarchist autobiography, lectured in Gender and Media Studies at the University of Sussex until 2006, and present is an investigative researcher at the Advertising Standards Authority. She has been a practising pagan for ten years.

Even though its causes are diverse and the greenhouse emissions vary from one country to another, the consequences are cumulative and global. It is, thus, essential that, without delay, we all assume responsibility and take actions both towards reducing our contribution to the problem and mitigating its effects. Costa Rica has decided to take immediate action by unilaterally declaring its goal to become a carbon-neutral country by 2021. The decision brings it in alignment with its local and global responsibilities and while in accordance with the principle of “common but differentiated responsibilities.” To achieve its objective, the Costa Rican Government has prepared a National Strategy on Climate Change entitled The Peace with Nature Initiative whose main pillars are: mitigation; adaptation; metrics; capability development and technology transfer; public awareness, education, and cultural change; and financing. Costa Rica is aware that the actions to be developed need to be consistent with and integral part of the country’s development policy, its economic growth plan and its poverty reduction strategy. In this way, it aims to show the world that “it is not only possible to have economic development in harmony with the environment, but that the route to achieve development is precisely that which utilizes natural resources wisely.”\r\n\r\nBorn in San José, Costa Rica in 1940, Dr. Arias studied law and economics at the University of Costa Rica and later received a doctoral degree in Political Science at the University of Essex, England. He served his first term as President of Costa Rica from 1986-90. Dr. Arias was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1987 for his work to end the military conflicts in Central America, culminating with the signing of the Esquipulas II Accords that year. After leaving office, he dedicated himself to working with the Arias Foundation for Peace and Human Progress, the NGO he established with the monetary proceeds of the Nobel Prize. \r\n\r\nIn 2006 he was elected to a second term as President, becoming the first Nobel Laureate in history to be elected to a nation’s top office after winning that prize. He will serve until 2010.

Like shells, they look pretty; but the life left them long ago, when they lost their power to work miracles.  In a short blaze of glory, they cured the blind, the crippled and the bedridden.  Holy wells were made by popular acclaim.  The cult of saints, of which they were only one aspect, could be stage-managed by the church; but it required the validation of spontaneous pilgrimage, and by the end of the Middle Ages, senior clergy had grown disenchanted with it altogether.  Then fashion moved on, and the old shrine was abandoned to curiosity-seekers and antiquaries.  The true history of holy wells has yet to be written.\r\n\r\nJeremy Harte is a researcher into the overlap between folklore and archaeology, with a particular interest in sacred space and the supernatural.

Many types of arthritis would appear to be determined by our genes and are likely often triggered by infection or joint injury. The disease has generally received limited attention mainly because it is not as life threatening as some other conditions. But in recent years society and governments have become more aware of this crippling disease and the tremendous economic and social burden that it presents.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the advent of renewed interest in joint pathology, stimulated in recent years by major technological advances in our understanding of how cellular processes are regulated in joint tissues, we are now reaching an exciting new understanding of how these diseases can be both detected and treated with an ability that would a few years ago not have been considered possible. In this lecture we will examine the challenges we face in this disease and examine current and future solutions in our successful fight against arthritis.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnthony Poole is Director of the Joint Diseases Laboratory, Shriners Hospitals for Children and Professor, Department of Surgery and Medicine at McGill University and Scientific Co-director of the Canadian Arthritis Network, a National Centre of Excellence. He has been President of the Canadian Orthopaedic Research Society, President of the 6th World Congress of the Inflammation Research Association and member of the Editorial Board of Arthritis Research. He has received numerous honors for his research including the Carol Nachman prize and a honorary DSC from the University of Reading. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnless otherwise noted, lectures start at 5.30, last one hour and take place in the Curtis Auditorium, Herschel Building, which sits directly across the road from Haymarket Metro Station.
