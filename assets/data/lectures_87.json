These may also be used as meditational practices, which, once made familiar, can be seen throughout all the works of Plato, Parmenides, Plotinus, Aristotle, and many others. Indeed as Porphyry wrote, \"Beatific contemplation does not consist of the accumulation of arguments or a storehouse of learned knowledge, but in us theory must become nature and life itself.\"\r\n\r\nThese living excellences are so fundamental, that they can be seen not only as essential to aid to the understanding of the individual, but also to the individual development, as well as integral to the human social structure, as Plato shows in his Republic and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThis is our second session on this text (our first was on April 18th) - but if you missed that, we will start this evening with a brief summary of what was discussed then. We will look at this subject using an extract from the Auxiliaries to the Perception of Intelligible Natures by Porphyry (circa 233 – 305 c.e.) This philosopher, a Phoenician of royal descent, was born in Tyre (in modern day Lebanon) but who traveled to Rome to study under Plotinus to whom he became attached as a disciple and confidant. It is thanks to him that we have the inspired speeches of Plotinus, as he recorded and arranged them into the Enneads we have today.\r\n\r\nThe evening will consist of a brief introduction to the subject and its place in the Platonic tradition, a reading of an extract from Porphyry's text, and then an open discussion amongst those present about the ideas being put forward by Porphyry.\r\n\r\nNo previous experience of formal philosophy is required.\r\n\r\nEntrance in free, but donations between £3-5 will be welcomed.\r\n\r\nA PDF download of the extract we will be reading is available on our website together with further details of this and other Prometheus Trust's activities: www.prometheustrust.co.uk (the PDF is on the \"London Monday Evenings\" page.)", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 2426, "added": "2016-04-07T10:45:03", "slug": "a8fc264e02cf9aae", "speakers": [{"id": 16087, "name": "Peter Lyle", "slug": "peter-lyle"}], "topics": [{"id": 3310, "name": "mythology", "path": "/religion/spirituality/spiritualdevelopment/mythology"}, {"id": 1822, "name": "philosophy", "path": "/academic/religion/religion/philosophy"}, {"id": 2388, "name": "philosophy", "path": "/arts/literature/philosophy/philosophy"}, {"id": 365, "name": "platonism", "path": "/arts/philosophy/platonism"}], "supercategory": "religion", "venue": {"id": 3106, "name": "Cecil Sharp House", "slug": "cecil-sharp-house", "city": "London", "postcode": "NW1 7AY"}, "organizer": {"id": 2041, "name": "The Prometheus Trust", "slug": "the-prometheus-trust"}, "date": "2016-05-16", "dates": [{"id": 15848, "from_date": "2016-05-16", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "19:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Donation", "ticket_info": null, "additional_info": null, "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 3106, "name": "Cecil Sharp House", "slug": "cecil-sharp-house", "city": "London", "postcode": "NW1 7AY"}, "organizer": {"id": 2041, "name": "The Prometheus Trust", "slug": "the-prometheus-trust"}}]}, {"id": 15282, "title": "James I, the Abbey and the 'beauty of holiness'", "synopsis": "Did James I have no association with Westminster Abbey other than commissioning monuments to Elizabeth I and his mother, Mary Queen of Scots?

Its political equivalent is the notion of open borders as a utopian critique of nationality and national identity. We can become good hosts by temporarily interrupting the self and our habitual concerns about ‘me’ and ‘mine’ and also by reframing our notion of identity, including national identity.\r\n\r\nWhy ‘unconditional’ hospitality? Because conditional hospitality (the only hospitality we know) has not really worked. Born in the Greek polis and the oman forum, developed further via the Judaeo-Christian tradition and Kantian/Hegelian philosophy, this type of hospitality is juridical: it is handled by codes, norms and regulations, and it is inscribed within the metaphysics of violence. We need an unconditional hospitality because ethics without hospitality is no ethics at all.\r\n\r\nManu Bazzano is an author, psychotherapist, and lecturer at Roehampton University.

The subprime disaster? What about mad cow disease? Each new crisis makes us worry until we start worrying about the next one. When something goes wrong, we are told that the way to prevent further crises is through better technology, more laws, and bigger bureaucracy. How to protect ourselves from the threat of terrorism? Homeland security, full body scanners, further sacrifice of individual freedom. How to counteract exploding costs in health care? Tax hikes, rationalization, better genetic markers. One idea is absent from these lists: risk-savvy citizens. And there is a reason for that. Many experts have concluded that people are basically hopeless when it comes to risk and, like a child who needs a parent, require continuous “nudging.\" Against this pessimistic view, I will argue that instead of being the solution, experts are often part of the problem, and that everyone can learn to deal with risk and uncertainty on their own.

", "keywords": "Europe, Debate, Politics, Economics", "body": "As 2011 comes to an end, what was unthinkable at its start is now on all our lips: member states could leave and the Euro could fail. The dream of European unity – to consign the prospect of war to the bloody annals of the early twentieth century – is no longer assured.\r\n\r\nThe fiction that Greece could pay back its debts through austerity is in shreds: Papandreou’s refusal to let his electorate silently follow the Irish into impoverishment and ignominy saw the swift imposition of a ‘national unity government’ at the behest of the EU, ECB and IMF troika. Within days the party was finally over for Berlusconi as Italy’s debts, that of the EU’s fourth-largest population and third-largest Eurozone economy, were declared unsustainable and another unelected technocracy imposed on its citizens.\r\n\r\nIt has long been known that the EU project was insulated from public accountability in the widest sense of the public: from both national electorates and national business interests. What is much clearer to many now is the degree to which – as a Franco-German project – it operates in their interests and not all of Europe’s. Yet with France’s need to protect an increasingly uncompetitive economy coming into conflict with a German desire to avoid 1920s-style inflation (but not at the cost of its trade surplus), even this project seems doomed. Might France be the next to go?\r\n\r\nWith Sarkozy and Merkel trying to square these circles, the interests of other countries are an increasing irritation. Europe is becoming a matter of winners and losers again with the language of force and domination (albeit economic) back on the political table. The option routinely trotted out is ‘unite or perish’: with the rise of populist, nationalist parties in Finland, Holland and Hungary seemingly showing the risks of a European future in which the public are allowed to have their say.\r\n\r\nAt a special Institute of Ideas Christmas Lecture, lecturers will reflect on the above, what has brought us to this point and what next year may hold for us. Are the fears of a coming depression or a populist backlash real or being stoked up to make sure the Eurocrats get their way? Is democracy at a national level really an obstacle to our only salvation: forced Euro-integration? Or is it more freedom and more democracy, demands for referenda, that we should put our faith in, even if it might risk the breakup of the Eurozone? Might it be Europe’s only chance of avoiding a future in which nobody is pro-European?\r\n\r\nLecturers:\r\n\r\nPhil Mullan: economist; business transformation director, Easynet Global Services; author The Imaginary Time Bomb\r\n\r\nSimon Nixon: European editor, Wall Street Journal’s Heard on the Street column; author, The Credit Crunch: how safe is your money?\r\n\r\nMark Seddon: writer and broadcaster; author, Standing for Something: life in the awkward squad\r\n\r\nChair:\r\n\r\nAngus Kennedy: head of external relations, Institute of Ideas; chair, IoI Economy Forum", "additional_info": null, "duration": 120, "image_id": 1622, "added": "2011-11-23T21:10:35", "slug": "23e511acc3d0f1ca", "speakers": [{"id": 11788, "name": "Mark Seddon", "slug": "mark-seddon"}, {"id": 7202, "name": "Phil Mullan", "slug": "phil-mullan"}, {"id": 11789, "name": "Simon Nixon", "slug": "simon-nixon"}, {"id": 8802, "name": "Angus Kennedy", "slug": "angus-kennedy"}], "topics": [{"id": 2482, "name": "europe", "path": "/business/economy/growth/welfare/europe"}, {"id": 1239, "name": "economics", "path": "/politics/economics/latinamerica/economics"}, {"id": 2722, "name": "politics", "path": "/academic/history/gender/politics"}, {"id": 2330, "name": "europe", "path": "/academic/law/intellectualpropertylaw/europe"}], "supercategory": "business", "venue": {"id": 941, "name": "Friends Meeting House", "slug": "friends-meeting-house", "city": "London", "postcode": "NW1 2BJ"}, "organizer": {"id": 45, "name": "Institute of Ideas", "slug": "institute-of-ideas"}, "date": "2011-12-15", "dates": [{"id": 10826, "from_date": "2011-12-15", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "7:00:00", "ticket_cost": "£8/£6", "ticket_info": "http://www.instituteofideas.com/events/xmaslecture2011.html", "additional_info": "Visit: www.instituteofideas.com", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 941, "name": "Friends Meeting House", "slug": "friends-meeting-house", "city": "London", "postcode": "NW1 2BJ"}, "organizer": {"id": 45, "name": "Institute of Ideas", "slug": "institute-of-ideas"}}]}, {"id": 10374, "title": "The three lives of Marie Curie", "synopsis": "Dr Serge Plattard examines how through the development of radiotherapy methods and instruments Marie Curie led the way in the fight against cancer.

Is religion the enemy or friend of contemporary art?", "keywords": "Art, Religion, Politics", "body": "The charge-sheet against religion’s curtailment of artistic freedom is long, and by no means confined to the past. Since the The Satanic Verses controversy 20 years ago, religious campaigners have sought to censor the Jyllands-Posten Mohammed cartoons, Behzti at the Birmingham Rep, Jerry Springer the Opera, The Da Vinci Code, Cosimo Cavallaro’s ‘My Sweet Lord’, Chandra Mohan’s The Beautiful Vexation… and the list goes on. Consequently, religion has become something of a bogeyman to the 21st century arts. \r\n\r\nBut aren’t secular states as guilty of censoring art as any religion, China’s Cultural Revolution being perhaps the best known example? Moreover, since time immemorial, religion has inspired art. The list of divinely inspired art is a match for any ‘religion-as-censor’ list: the Sistine Chapel, the Mahabharatha, Bernstein’s Chichester Psalms, Dante’s Divine Comedy, Ginsberg’s ‘Kaddish’, Rumi’s poetry and Handel’s Messiah are just the tip of the iceberg. The religious and sacred in art points to something beyond the merely natural or biological in the human condition. For William Blake, the imagination was the ‘human form divine’. \r\n\r\nIs there a place for the divine in art in the 21st century? Is religion the enemy or friend of contemporary art? Can we fully enjoy our artistic legacy if we don’t know our religious history? Andrew Motion has called for school children to be taught the bible so they can fully appreciate poets like Milton. But how does multicultural, secular society cope with art that celebrates specific beliefs over others? Can art that celebrates a particular faith still be universal in what it says about humanity? Have we lost faith in art that aims to transcend and transform full stop? And if so, is that the death knell for sacred art?

Such arguments tend to rely on conceptions of sexual or gender freedom which presume certain conceptions of secular progress and to forget or dismiss conceptions of sexual politics that are bound to anti-racist struggle. Without denying that clear tensions exist between religious traditions that condemn and forbid homosexuality and progressive sexual movements that tend to promote exclusionary conceptions of the secular, the lecture focuses on the importance of conceptions of cultural translation, antagonism, and the critique of state coercion to consider what ‘critical coalition’ might mean for religious and sexual minorities\r\n\r\nJudith Butler is Maxine Elliot Professor at the University of California, Berkeley.

About the Institut français du Royaume-Uni\r\n\r\nFounded in 1910 by a private benefactor, the Institut français is the official French government centre of language and culture, one of the 150 Instituts troughout the world and one of  the oldest French cultural centres based abroad. The Language Centre offers a wide range of courses in general or specialised French language, while the Cultural Centre stresses two areas: French, European and World cinema and cutting-edge writing and thought.\r\n\r\nh4. The Language Centre\r\n\r\nThe Language Centre offers tuition to over 6000 students a year and has 75 carefully selected, highly professional tutors. Courses are continually being adapted to suit the requirements of our students. In addition to traditional language courses, we have courses covering French culture, current affairs and business French.\r\n\r\nh4.

A public cinema with 300 seats, Ciné lumière is open to everyone. You don't have to be a member of the Institut français - nor do you have to speak French! All films are shown in original version with English subtitles.\r\n\r\nh4.

Talks Programme\r\n\r\nThe Institut français has a varied programme of talks, giving a wide range of speakers the opportunity to express themselves freely and enter into a dialogue with the public.
