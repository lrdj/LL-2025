We will be sharing the work and perspectives of people actively involved in this process including representatives from projects, collaborations and organisations such as #SDGChallenge, #TeachSDGs, UKSSD, the 2030hub, the Aviva Graduate Leaders SDG Challenge and others. We will hopefully be hearing from Professor Jeffrey Sachs via Skype to get us going!\r\n\r\nWhether you are at the awareness raising stage of your global goals journey or moving to embedding and action, we invite anyone with an interest in the 17 interlinked goal themes and 169 targets to come along.\r\n\r\nWe also invite anyone that may not know much about the SDGs, but is interested in intergenerational collaboration around themes such as sustainability, human rights and collective wellbeing.\r\n\r\nAlthough there will be a programme (circulated to those registered in April), the afternoon will have an informal feel. We hope to move towards identifying successful models of practice for intergenerational and cross-sector projects.

The Reformation was a culmination of events and circumstances that led to a seismic shift in the religious framework of Britain. It established the image of an island nation, separate and supreme, still resonant today. It triggered a religious and political redistribution of power. It led to renewal and reform but also deep division, persecution and violence. And out of this turmoil were born the concepts of state and church as we know them today.\r\n\r\nThe 500th Anniversary of the beginning of the Reformation provides the opportunity to explore and reflect upon issues of church, state, and religious and cultural diversity that are still at the centre of our national life: the conflicts that divide, and the convictions which diverse parts of the Christian church hold sacred. How are we called to be reformed by the Gospel? How do we build the unity Christ called for with those whose convictions are very different from our own?\r\n\r\nIn this autumn lecture series we will be exploring some of those hopes and controversies.\r\n\r\nLucy Winkett was the first woman priest appointed at St Paul’s Cathedral, later becoming Canon Precentor.

of the Wiener Library’s Refugees Then and Now Series in conjunction with our new temporary exhibition, A Bitter Road: Britain and the Refugee Crisis of the 1930s and 1940s, we are pleased to host a talk by Professor Marie Gillespie (The Open University).\r\n\r\nThis lecture examines the use of smartphones and social media by young Syrian refugees and asks whether this small ubiquitous device is changing the nature of refugee experiences. The widespread use of smartphones is a distinctive feature of the recent human exodus from Syria but they entail dangers as well as benefits. On the one hand smartphones are a refugee essential : “to make the journey we need a phone, food and water – in that order”, Professor Gillespie was told. \r\n\r\nHowever, the digital traces that refugees’ phones leave behind make them vulnerable to surveillance by government officials, smugglers, traffickers and organized criminals. Governments and organizations can of course use digital data to gather information about refugees that can help better serve their needs but we need to understand the dynamics of trust and risk, security and privacy play for refugees when they are on the move and when they in protracted situations. \r\n\r\nThe lecture hopes to provide a better understanding of how refugees use smartphones for a variety of purposes: (i) to access information about  access to services and resources in a context of ‘information precarity’; (2) to maintain family and social relationships, create transnational networks, engage with the political issues that relate to their situation and their future; and (3) to narrate their own experiences in a context where so much is being said ‘about them’ and done ‘to them.’ Given the risks of using smartphones, one of the most pressing issues concerns how the tensions between the empowerment and surveillance in smartphone use can best be navigated and managed by refugees as well as service providers. How can organisations and refugee support groups best exploit the potential of digital data to offer better service provision – to promote ‘smart migration’? \r\n\r\nTo understand these dynamics, we must situate refugees’ experiences, vulnerabilities and survival strategies at the heart of our investigation. The lecture is based on research with Syrian refugees in Mytiline, Lesvos as well as in London. Swansea and Paris.\r\n\r\nMarie Gillespie is Professor of Sociology at The Open University and Co-Director of the Centre for Research on Socio-Cultural Change.

Now he directs our attention to a new movement in which his own ideas have played a crucial role: effective altruism.\r\n\r\nEffective altruism is built upon the simple but profound idea that living a fully ethical life involves doing the “most good you can do.” Such a life requires an unsentimental view of charitable giving: to be a worthy recipient of our support, an organization must be able to demonstrate that it will do more good with our money or our time than other options open to us.\r\n\r\nPeter Singer shows how living altruistically often leads to greater personal fulfillment than living for oneself.\r\n\r\nHis most recent book is, The Most Good You Can Do, which helps to develop the challenges Singer has made to those who donate to the arts, and to charities focused on helping our fellow citizens, rather than those for whom we can do the most good. Effective altruists are extending our knowledge of the possibilities of living less selfishly, and of allowing reason, rather than emotion, to determine how we live.\r\n\r\nThe event will be chaired by philosopher, Nigel Warburton.\r\n\r\nNigel Warburton is a freelance philosopher, writer, and podcaster.

His typically poetic and philosophical statement could not have been written by a contemporary artist honest about the harsh world of the art market and the symbolic dilemmas prompted simply by wanting to be an artist in one of the world’s centres of global capitalism, let alone by being an Australian artist in what was – or maybe still is – the capital of ‘our’ empire.\r\n\r\nWith the recent collapse of the world financial markets, and keeping its on-going effects in mind, one of which is the so-called ‘rise to power’ of the Asian region of which Australia is a part, it could be that being an Australian artist in a European capital now is not a position of supplication to the powers-at-be in a European or British global art centre; rather the Australian artist now might feel that she comes from the future, from a more affluent, more modern, ‘Asian-focused’,cosmopolitan and forward-looking world. Or is this hubris? \r\n\r\nWith invited Australians Deej Fabyc, Paul Knight, Katrina Schwarz and Christian Thompson joining him in discussion, the critic John Mateer will propose that while it is true that international art remains strongly tied to networks of global capital, in which London remains one of the key centres, the shift in the past decade towards the East and the South has now given Australian artists the opportunity of effective autonomy. For the first time Australia is closely tied to the most dynamic financial and cultural centres on the globe.\r\n\r\nThe event will be chaired by Dr. Ian Henderson, The Menzies Centre for Australian Studies, Kings College London.

", "keywords": "Children, literacy, education", "body": "When a survey earlier this year found many teachers had given up forcing boys to read Dickens and Austen, because ‘they turn off after the 100th page’, it was not greeted with surprise from anyone who has recently set foot inside a classroom. Recent research indicates one in 11 boys in England (19,000 each year) start secondary school with the reading skills of a seven-year-old at best, while a recent National Literacy Trust survey found nearly a quarter of boys asked found reading boring, compared to 13% of girls. Faced with warnings from experts that by age 11 it is increasingly difficult to develop this vital educational skill, there has been ever greater pressure on government to act earlier and earlier to make sure boys don’t start slipping behind for good.\r\n\r\nYet there is fierce debate over what can or should be done to tackle this apparent crisis. Former schools minister Jim Knight sought to encourage fathers to read more themselves to show their sons reading is an acceptable masculine pursuit; other measures have included getting more male role models in the classroom and even calls for specialised gender-based teaching methods which encourage separate ‘boy-friendly’ books, even if that means fewer classics and more comics. But if boys and girls are given different books to read, will they be trapped in literary ‘gender ghettoes’ and miss out on the chance to stretch their imaginations? Some insist it’s a risk worth taking: leading children’s novelist Frank Cottrell Boyce has warned we are facing ‘a national catastrophe’, with millions shunning reading for life unless teachers are prepared to engage boys with shorter and engaging stories rather than wasting time ‘ticking off books’. Charlie Higson, author of the hugely successful Young Bond young adult books, has declared ‘life is too short for Dickens’.\r\n\r\nOverall, the literacy debate tends to focus on the technical aspects of literacy, testing children’s achievement in terms of ‘key skills’. But might this approach alienate young readers from the broader pleasures of engaging with literature? Or is it time to accept that getting boys to an acceptable standard of literacy is more important than boring them rigid with books they won’t understand or care about?

Just as the internet has changed economics, culture, and politics, it is also transforming the practice of foreign policy.

Recent events in North Africa and the Middle East have put a spotlight on these phenomena. The United States is responding to these shifts in international relations by extending the reach of our diplomacy beyond government-to-government communications. We are adapting our statecraft by reshaping our development and diplomatic agendas to meet old challenges in new ways and by deploying one of America's great assets – innovation.

For nearly five centuries the methods and practices of book publishing remained largely unchanged, but at the dawn of the 21st Century the industry finds itself faced with perhaps the greatest challenges since Gutenberg. A combination of economic pressures and technological change is forcing publishers to alter their practices and think hard about the future of the book.\r\n\r\nIn his book, Merchants of Culture|, the first major study of trade publishing for 30 years, Thompson situates the current challenges facing the industry in an historical context, analyzing the transformation of trade publishing in the United States and Britain since the 1960s.  He gives a detailed account of how the world of trade publishing really works, dissecting the roles of publishers, agents and booksellers and showing how their practices are shaped by a field that has a distinctive structure and dynamic.\r\n\r\nIn this discussion Thompson will show how an understanding of the publishing\r\nworld can shed light on what makes a bestseller today and he will reflect on\r\nthe key challenges facing publishers and writers as the book - one of the\r\noldest of our cultural artefacts - enters the digital age. \r\n\r\nJohn Thompson is Professor of Sociology at the University of Cambridge and Fellow of Jesus College, Cambridge. He received a BA from Keele in 1975 and a PhD from Cambridge in 1979. He was a Research Fellow at Jesus College from 1979 to 1984. He was appointed Lecturer in Sociology at the University of Cambridge in 1985, Reader in Sociology in 1994 and Professor of Sociology in 2001. He has held Visiting Professorships at universities in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Chile, China and South Africa. His main areas of research are contemporary social and political theory; sociology of the media and modern culture; the social organization of the media industries; the social and political impact of information and communication technologies; and the changing forms of political communication. Recent publications include Ideology and Modern Culture (1990), The Media and Modernity (1995), Political Scandal (2000), Books in the Digital Age (2005) and Merchants of Culture (2010). He was awarded the European Amalfi Prize for Sociology and the Social Sciences in 2001 for his work on political scandal. He is currently working on the changing structure of the book publishing industry and the making of bestsellers. \r\n\r\nAndrew Franklin is the founder and Managing Director of Profile Books, one of Britain’s leading independent publishers. He set up the company up on April Fools’ Day 1996. Profile Books has been small publisher of the year three times (the only publisher to win the accolade more than once). He is a trustee of the Edinburgh International Book Festival, former Chairman of the Jewish Community Centre for London, a non-executive director of Rare, a diversity recruitment business, and a visiting professor at City University, London. \r\n\r\nAndrew Franklin’s authors at Profile include Alan Bennett, Francis Fukuyama, Wole Soyinka, Raja Shehadeh, Susie Orbach and Lynne Truss, whose book Eats, Shoots and Leaves sold over 1.4 million copies in hardback and over 3 million worldwide. Unlike many independent publishers, Profile has been consistently profitable since its second year and grown continuously. This is despite its commitment to publishing original, stimulating and sometimes challenging non-fiction.

Much has been written about President Obama’s family heritage, and in an address to the Turkish Parliament he noted that many Americans are either Muslim or ‘have Muslims in their families or have lived in a Muslim majority country. I know, because I am one of them’. During Britain’s ‘Who Do We Think We Are? week this year, Sir Keith Ajegbo urged schools across the country to undertake ‘investigations and celebrations by schools of pupils’ histories and their community’s roots and of the national and global links they can make’. \r\n\r\nUsing history as a lens through which to examine our current identities, however, inevitably changes the character of history as an academic subject. Instead of the disinterested pursuit of historical fact, history becomes a reflection of today’s world and a means of contextualising our contemporary political concerns. Indeed in university departments on both sides of the Atlantic, history is often approached in terms of the experience of different groups rather than the universal significance of historical events, with history segmented into ‘women’s history’ or ‘minority history’. \r\n\r\nDoes history as a lesson in diversity undermine or enrich the academic teaching of the subject? Has history ever been a disinterested matter, the oft-quoted warning being that ‘history is written by the victors’? Does going back to our roots really help either social cohesion or historical understanding? Or have we become so obsessed with our own identities that the defining question of our time is not ‘What are we going to do?’ but ‘Who do you think you are?’ Does ‘history-through-identity’ simply provide a more comprehensive narrative of historical and social progression and change, with those written out of history given acknowledgement at last? Or are identity politics undermining the possibility of universal values and a human history we can all relate to?

Prof Gowers will then attempt to explain what some of these distinct types are and what their significance is in contemporary mathematics.\r\n\r\nPhilosophical\r\n\r\nProf Adrian Moore will explore Aristotle's distinction between the actual infinite and the potential infinite, and Aristotle's way of using it to solve various paradoxes of the infinite.  Aristotle's own view was that only the potential infinite made sense.  For over two thousand years this view was the orthodoxy.

It does so by presenting an overview of the recurrent features found in the openings of calls where a client's next of kin phones the company to a request a carer on behalf of the client.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first part of the paper examines the structure of the openings in the light of the research previously carried out in this area on English service calls using analytical tools from conversation analysis. The findings reveal that they unfold in distinguishable sequences, namely summons/answer, identification/recognition and the reason for the call. In this respect they show a similar pattern to that identified in English service calls. Unlike the latter, however, the Montevidean calls analysed in this study exhibit a high incidence of greetings and self-identification by the service provider during the initial sequences.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second part of the paper investigates the pragmatic function(s) of verbal elements within the turns of the openings. More specifically, an analysis of the realisation of the reason for the call is provided as well as a discussion of the pragmatic function(s) of greetings and self-identification. The results indicate that both call-takers and callers display an overall preference for interactional closeness. The observed interactional closeness is explained by the participants' orientation towards the positive end of Brown and Levinson's (1987) politeness dichotomy and by the callers' strategic aim of ensuring a good service.\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 60, "image_id": null, "added": "2004-04-27T04:31:23", "slug": "research-on-languages-and-linguistics-seminars", "speakers": [{"id":
