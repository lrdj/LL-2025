Other South Asian religions professing to condone social equality such as Islam, Sikhism and Christianity have also adopted the Hindu model in practice showing that any generalised statement about the caste system can be contradicted by yet another completely opposite statement, such is the bewildering nature of the Indian caste system.

Why was this?  Modern commentators often suggest that this was merely cultural conditioning, and an aspect of the Platonic tradition which can safely be ignored.   But this upholding of pagan practices continued well into the sixth century AD and so strong was their adherence, that in 529AD the emperor Justinian forced the closure of the Platonic schools simply because they were the main source of opposition to the contemporary Christian Church and Christianized Emperorship.  Perhaps, then, there were good reasons that these philosophers framed their philosophy within the pagan worldview.  This lecture and study session will look at the metaphysical and theological basis of the Platonic tradition and explore this largely neglected area of philosophy.  We will ask whether a coherent metaphysics is possible without the Gods, and whether human life, both ethical and artistic, is enhanced by a philosophy which affirms that \"all things are full of the Gods.\"\r\n\r\nThis is the second of three linked evenings on this theme: this session will be based around a reading of part of Thomas Taylor's introduction to Proclus' Theology of Plato.  A download of the previous session's lecture and this session's reading is available on the Prometheus Trust website (see below).

However, we must produce 60% more food by 2050, to match a population that is predicted to increase from 7 billion now, to 9.5 billion, then.

Author, journalist and academic Sarah Niblock examines how Prince is a master of the power of imagery in marketing, self-styling himself as someone ethically ambiguous, androgynous and aspirational.\r\n\r\nWhether he is stealing the limelight from the models in tomato satin and sunglasses at Paris Fashion Week or reclining seductively in brocade and doe-eyed mascara in one of his films, Prince commands our attention. How could this 5ft 2ins multi-ethnic feminised male make such a profound and memorable visual impact? A visual journey through some of his most iconic fashion moments shows how Prince utilises a dazzling array of visual signifiers from head to toe. Whether he’s sporting that iconic lavender raincoat in Purple Rain to adjusting the cufflinks of his immaculate jazz suits, Prince’s exuberant campness, full of visual puns, comments on the banality of white, mainstream, Western masculinity.\r\n\r\nHis theatrical ethnic masculinity offers a powerful visual and symbolic assault on the mainstream. His dandified zoot suits harness the raw energy and anger of hard-time street fashion coupled with decadence and indifference to aristocratic mores. Mapped against the vigorous representations of white American rock, Prince’s preoccupation with gender bending, the feminine and the effete is startling. Over three decades his look, with all the indisputable signifiers of femininity, class and ethnicity, has helped reconfigure our views around sexuality, race, gender and normalized behaviour.\r\n\r\nSarah Niblock is Professor of Journalism at Brunel University, London. She is the author of Prince: The Making of a Pop Music Phenomenon (Ashgate 2012, co-written with Stan Hawkins) and several other books, chapters and journal articles on journalism and visual culture. She has been a journalist for more than 20 years, writing news and features for the national and regional print media including Company and Cosmopolitan magazines.

It is also the least understood and is threatened by increasing anthropogenic disturbance. Advances in technology mean it is now possible to fish these regions to depths in excess of two kilometres. Mining, drilling, acidification and warming all present serious threats to biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.\r\n\r\nHigh Seas, those areas of the open ocean that lie beyond the 200nm Exclusive Economic Zones of coastal nations, encompass ~50% of Earth's surface but remain largely unregulated. Attempts to ameliorate threats to fished species by conventional fishery management approaches are frequently ineffective. Legal frameworks for prospecting and the extraction of mineral resources from the deep seabed beyond national jurisdiction exist but do not apply to other activities.\r\n\r\nMarine Protected Areas established in coastal marine ecosystems are proving successful in effectively protecting diversity and productivity where traditional management approaches have failed. In 2002 the World Summit on Sustainable Development listed the establishment of Marine Protected Areas and representative networks by the year 2012 as a distinct goal. In response to concerns raised by the international community the UN adopted several resolutions with respect to the management of deep-sea fisheries on the high seas. This issue is high on conservation agendas; however, there remains a critical need for science to translate rapidly and effectively into management policy.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this symposium is to assess the current state of progress, and any barriers, towards the establishment of Marine Protected Areas, particularly in regions beyond the reaches of national jurisdiction — the high seas.\r\n\r\n_Organised by Kirsty Kemp (Institute of Zoology, ZSL) and Alex Rogers (Dept. of Zoology, University of Oxford)._\r\n\r\nREGISTRATION WILL OPEN SOON\r\n\r\nFor further details or to register your interest, please see www.zsl.org/science/scientific-meetings/ or contact Joy Hayward, Scientific Meetings Coordinator, Zoological Society of London, Regent's Park, London NW1 4RY; tel: +44 (0)20 7449 6227; fax: +44 (0)20 7449 6411; e-mail: joy.hayward@zsl.org.\r\n\r\n*ZSL Science and Conservation Events:* An essential part of ZSL's work is to communicate relevant, high-quality zoological and conservation science.

The use of psychoactive chemicals are one such technique for plugging directly into the numinous that obviate the need for gods, guides or gurus, and this may be why both left and right wing governments want to see them banned.\r\n\r\nSo come and join in a mystical tour that starts in prehistory, shadows the story of the Knights Templar, hides in the Invisible College and finally bursts into view with the discovery of LSD.

In 1992, he was elected as a deputy to the National Assembly. During his 1992–1996 term he served on the Assembly's Commission for EU Affairs, the Commission for the Supervision of Intelligence and Security Services and the Committee on Defence, and also led Slovenia's delegation at the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. In 1993, he became vice leader of the United List of Social Democrats (ZLSD). He was re-elected as a deputy in the National Assembly in 1996. Up until April 1997 he served as a Vice-President and was a member of the Committee on International Relations, the Constitutional Commission and the Committee on Defence, the Chairman of the Slovenian Delegation to the parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, and a member of the Executive Committee of the Inter-Parliamentary Union. At the 3rd ZDSL congress in March 1997 in Ljubljana, he was elected the new party leader. At the 2000 general election, he was elected as a deputy and became President of the National Assembly. In June 2001, he was re-elected leader of the ZLSD at the party's congress in Koper. In June 2004, before the end of his term in the Slovenian National Assembly, he was elected via a preference vote as an MEP at the European parliamentary elections. There, he was a member of the Socialist Group, the Committee on Budgetary Control and the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, and was the Vice-Chairman of the Delegation to the EU-Croatia Joint Parliamentary Committee. On his initiative the party was renamed the Social Democrats (SD) at the ZLSD's 5th congress in April 2005 held in Ljubljana. \r\n\r\nThe 2008 general elections brought a relative victory to the Social Democrats. Acting on the basis of the election result and having consulted parliamentary groups, the President of the Republic of Slovenia, Danilo Türk, appointed Borut Pahor Prime Minister, which was confirmed on 7 November by a ballot in the National Assembly. A new government was sworn in on 21 November 2008 and met for its opening session on 22 November 2008. The coalition government led by Borut Pahor comprises the Social Democrats, the Zares party, the Democratic Party of Pensioners of Slovenia and the Liberal Democracy of Slovenia.\r\n\r\nMr Pahor has a Bachelor of Political Sciences, he majored in international relations from the then Faculty of Sociology, Political Sciences and Journalism. He graduated with honours in 1987, receiving the highest Slovenian academic awards (the Prešeren and Zore Awards) for students for his undergraduate thesis. \r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 60, "image_id": 732, "added": "2009-01-27T10:15:56", "slug": "from-a-federal-entity-to-a-state-at-the-helm-of-the-eu", "speakers": [{"id": 8013, "name": "Borut Pahor", "slug": "borut-pahor"}], "topics": [{"id": 282, "name": "europe", "path": "/arts/historyofart/europe"}, {"id": 621, "name": "europe", "path": "/politics/history/europe"}, {"id": 1204, "name": "europe", "path": "/politics/energy/europe"}, {"id": 1207, "name": "europe", "path": "/society/development/europe"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 1754, "name": "Wolfson Theatre, London School of Economics & Political Science", "slug": "wolfson-theatre-london-school-of-economics-political-science", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC2A 2AE"}, "organizer": {"id": 1287, "name": "London School of Economics & Political Science", "slug": "london-school-of-economics-political-science"}, "date": "2009-02-05", "dates": [{"id": 6702, "from_date": "2009-02-05", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "13:00:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": "This event is free and open to all however a ticket is required.

Over 25,000 Germans chose to remain in Britain after the last POW were repatriated in 1948 and the lecture will concentrate on this largely post-war German “invasion” and the impact on the host communities \r\n\r\n\r\nRelics of this complex military settlement system have virtually disappeared, but since English Heritage “scheduled” the surviving Camp 93 at Harperley in Weardale in 2002, this little known aspect of the war and its aftermath has attracted increased public interest, not least in the media. The legacy of an extraordinary historical episode survives today not only in the public records and a few archeological sites, but in POW art and artifacts, camp newspapers, autobiographies, private correspondence and international friendships. This legacy will be explored with particular reference to two local camps at Harperley and Featherstone Park (Haltwhistle), the latter famous as the Freedom Camp and home to over 25,000 German officers during its existence.\r\n\r\n\r\nFollowing National Service as a seaman officer, the speaker graduated from Oxford and joined the Colonial Service in Africa as a district officer. Northern Rhodesia’s impending independence brought a career change, leading from a fellowship and doctorate at Bonn University to a lectureship at Newcastle in 1964. Until his retirement in 2000 he specialized in development studies and medical geography, working as a consultant to various UN agencies, including the Population Division and the World Health Organization. He has held visiting professorships at Zomba, Cairo, Halle-Wittenberg, and Heidelberg, and continues as English editor of the leading German geographical journal, Erdkunde. He is Secretary of the Northumbrian Universities Military Education Committee and a trustee of the Harperley POW Museum.\r\n\r\n\r\nHis interest in the British POW camps began in 1995 after encountering relics of the former Camp 18 when walking beside the South Tyne at Featherstone Park. This led to archival research in London, Geneva, and Germany, and to fieldwork from Cornwall to Caithness, latterly in collaboration with English Heritage. He has published widely on the POW theme, not least in local newspapers and magazines in Britain and Germany in pursuit of “lost” evidence. An invitation in 1999 to become historical consultant for the BBC2 Timewatch programme, The Germans We Kept (2000), led to other consultancies including the 5-part German ZDF series Die Gefangenen (The Prisoners) and BBC2’s Restoration series. This media exposure has brought not only invitations to talk on the camps at nearly one hundred venues since retirement, as far afield as Germany and the Czech Republic, but also to a continuing flow of memorabilia donated by former POW and their families to the Harperley POW Museum. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnless otherwise noted, lectures start at 5.30, last one hour and take place in the Curtis Auditorium, Herschel Building, which sits directly across the road from Haymarket Metro Station. All lectures are free and the public are encouraged to attend.
