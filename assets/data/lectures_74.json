At the beginning of the second book of the Republic Socrates suggests that, since the soul is too small and too close for us to look at easily, he and his fellow thinkers should explore the workings of a republic because, he claims, it is an analogue of the soul and its multiple \"parts\" or modes. \r\n\r\nThis evening we'll read extracts from Proclus' commentary on the Republic in which he discusses the nature of the parts, the way that they work as a whole, and the virtue (or excellence) which each part must be directed towards if the just and happy life is to be lived.

In his 2016 book of short stories based on that experience, The Wing Orderly’s Tales, he gives a fascinating insight into the inmates he worked with and why some people end up committing crimes. Previous work considering imprisonment and its consequences includes A Good Day For A Dog (2008) and My father’s Watch (2009) – the latter written with Patrick Maguire is an intensely moving memoir of his co-author, one of the ‘Maguire Seven’, wrongly imprisoned as a teenager for making bombs for the IRA.\r\n\r\nGébler has already proved himself a master at transmuting historical facts into compelling fiction…And in this new novel he’s just as adroit at creating psychological and dramatic suspense out of known facts … a book so rich in characterisation, so expertly paced and so well written that it works equally well as absorbing social history and page-turning thriller.\r\nIrish Independent\r\nAs a catastrophist who never doubted from the moment he started that conditions in what he calls the Kingdom of Letters would only get worse, Carlo Gébler is not in the least surprised by how things have turned out.

The book is an intriguing mixture of pungent, fierce and striking memoir with pithy mordant notes on the literary trade, on the books he’s written and why he wrote them, and on the difficult business of negotiating a way through the thickets and trying to make a living. Also published in 2015 was his part biography/part memoir about his relationship with his father Ernest Gébler: The Projectionist: The Story of Ernest Gébler.

The famines that had been so common in the colonial era disappeared, and steady economic growth replaced the almost complete stagnation characteristic of the long rule of the Raj. The growth of the Indian economy, which has quickened over the last three decades, became the second fastest in the world. Despite a recent dip, it is still one of the highest among nations.\r\n\r\nMaintaining rapid as well as environmentally sustainable growth remains an important and achieveable goal for India. In this lecture, based on his new book written with Professor Jean Drèze, An Uncertain Glory, Sen will argue that the country's main problems lie elsewhere, particularly in the lack of attention that is paid to the essential needs of the people, especially the poor. One of the biggest failures has been the very inadequate use of the public resources generated by economic growth to expand India's lagging physical and social infrastructure (in sharp contrast, for example, to what China has done): there is a continued inadequacy both of social services such as schooling, medical care and immunization, and of physical services such as the provision of safe water, electricity, drainage and sanitation. Even as India has overtaken other countries in its rate of growth, because of these inadequacies it has, the book shows, fallen behind many of the same countries - often very poor ones - in quality of life.\r\n\r\nBecause of the importance of democracy in India, addressing these failures will require not only significant policy rethinking by the government, but also a better public understanding of the abysmal extent of social and economic deprivations. The deep inequalities in Indian society tend to constrict public discussion in India's vibrant media to the lives and concerns of the relatively affluent. Dreze and Sen argue that if there is to be more effective democratic practice, there has to be a clearer understanding of the severity of human deprivations in India. \r\n\r\nAmartya Sen is Lamont University Professor, professor of Philosophy and professor of Economics, at Harvard University.

So is the time after menopause for women, a time of vigorous and productive life without the costs of pregnancy. These new stages of life allow people to reproduce quickly and to keep alive more of their offspring than any other species of mammal. Human evolution operated first to shorten the infancy stage of life by weaning infants early compared to other primates. This created the human childhood stage of life, but children require care from many people of the family and social group. Evolution then prolonged the growth period by adding an adolescent stage, which improves sexual appeal and the learning of adult jobs.\r\n\r\nFinally, a long period of life beyond menopause became part of human biology, and grandmothers became part of human societies.

By the time he graduated from college he had 71 articles published in the paper. He started full time in 1999, based in London as the European M&A reporter, before moving back to New York in 2000 to take up his current post.

We now know that there is a real music of the spheres: The stars have sounds in them that we can use to see right to their very cores. This multi-media lecture looks at the relationship of music to stellar sounds. You will hear the real sounds of the stars (with a key change and many changes of octave, of course) and you will even hear musical compositions where every member of the orchestra is a real (astronomical) star. You will learn about the latest discoveries using stellar sounds and vibrations, including stars that are giant diamonds the size of the Earth, and a class of the most peculiar stars in the sky that were discovered by the lecturer. You will even hear how stellar sounds are involved in the discovery of new planets outside the solar system. The talk will finish with results from the NASA Kepler Space Mission to search for Earth-sized planets, and see to the hearts of the stars with unprecedented precision by “listening” to the real Music of the Spheres.", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": null, "added": "2009-11-07T23:52:07", "slug": "5bd6b5c2c3efb990", "speakers": [{"id": 4720, "name": "Professor Don Kurtz", "slug": "professor-don-kurtz"}], "topics": [{"id": 1019, "name": "astronomy", "path": "/science/physics/astronomy"}, {"id": 1149, "name": "astronomy", "path": "/society/history/astronomy"}, {"id": 1619, "name": "astronomy", "path": "/arts/poetry/astronomy"}, {"id": 1870, "name": "music", "path": "/science/astronomy/music"}, {"id": 1870, "name": "music", "path": "/science/astronomy/music"}], "supercategory": "science", "venue": {"id": 1512, "name": "Royal Astronomical Society", "slug": "royal-astronomical-society", "city": "London", "postcode": "W1J 0BQ"}, "organizer": {"id": 1512, "name": "Royal Astronomical Society", "slug": "royal-astronomical-society"}, "date": "2010-06-08", "dates": [{"id": 7665, "from_date": "2010-06-08", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "1 day, 0:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Free after 1230 on the day", "ticket_info": "Reception at the Royal Astronomical Society", "additional_info": "Tube: Green Park\r\nTel: 020 7734 3307\r\nSeats may be reserved in advance by Friends of the RAS and remaining seats will be offered on the day on a first-come first served basis.

The rapid sailing, equipping and training of an ad-hoc task group of Royal Naval, Royal Fleet Auxiliary and Merchant Naval ships; the planning of the landings and their execution; the follow up operations with 5 Brigade and the inshore and logistic problems in support of the military as they moved towards Stanley and final victory.  \r\n\r\nCommodore Clapp commanded the Falkland’s Amphibious Task Group (CTG 317.0).  Brigadier Thompson, his Landing Force Commander, and he jointly planned the landing of 3 Commando Brigade in San Carlos Water while Clapp was responsible for its execution.  Clapp later landed the Divisional Headquarters and the Army 5 Brigade and was responsible for most inshore operations and much of the logistic support of the military. \r\n\r\nAND\r\n\r\nBeachcombing\r\nLieutenant- Colonel Ewen Southby-Tailyour\r\nBeachcombing  is the expression used for covert beach intelligence undertaken by people like me when 'on holiday' and which is then forwarded to DI4 - undertaken, seemingly by an innocent 'tourist' without obvious equipment for, say, measuring the stability of sand surface or underwater gradients. In 1978, Ewen Southby-Tailyour was an officer commanding a small Royal Marines detachment in the Falkland Islands. On his own initiative he sailed around and extensively chartered the waters and compiled a notebook filled with data on harbours, inlets and landing spots. Even today it is still the most comprehensive sailing guide to the area. After the Argentine forces invaded, the British Forces asked for his book but he refused unless assigned as ‘staff officer without portfolio.’ He was made the navigation adviser to the command as well as commander of the Task Force Landing Craft Squadron. \r\nEwen Southby-Tailyour joined the Royal Marines in 1960, served in 42 43 and 45 (twice) Cdos and numerous UK, US and French ships as a Landing Craft Officer. He was seconded to the Sultan of Muscat's Armed Forces from 1966-68 as a Company Commander and was awarded the Sultan's Bravery Medal for operations during the Dhofar War. He commanded naval party 8901 in the Falklands 1978-79 - (surveyed beaches for own use) then returned in 1982 as the Amphibious and Navigational Adviser and as CO of the specially formed Task Force Landing Craft Squadron. He invented, formed then commanded for 4 years 539 Assault Squadron Royal Marines before retiring in 1992 when he became an author of military biographies and built yachts for high-latitude exploring and surveying. \r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": null, "added": "2007-04-24T14:21:20", "slug": "eb8d732af58f8f3e", "speakers": [{"id": 5407, "name": "Commodore Michael Clapp", "slug": "commodore-michael-clapp"}, {"id": 5408, "name": "Lieutenant - Colonel Ewen Southby-Tailyour", "slug": "lieutenant-colonel-ewen-southby-tailyour"}], "topics": [{"id": 106, "name": "wwi", "path": "/arts/books/history/military/wwi"}, {"id": 107, "name": "wwii", "path": "/arts/books/history/military/wwii"}, {"id": 108, "name": "army", "path": "/arts/books/history/military/army"}, {"id": 109, "name": "navy", "path": "/arts/books/history/military/navy"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 632, "name": "National Maritime Museum", "slug": "national-maritime-museum", "city": "Greenwich", "postcode": "SE10 9NF"}, "organizer": {"id": 632, "name": "National Maritime Museum", "slug": "national-maritime-museum"}, "date": "2007-05-31", "dates": [{"id": 4458, "from_date": "2007-05-31", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "11:00:00", "ticket_cost": "£7.50/£5.50", "ticket_info": "National Maritime Museum.

Many religions believe believers’ souls are rewarded after death for suffering, but neurosurgeon Henry Marsh (Atkinson Morley Hospital) finds that a small comfort. He has seen that brain diseases can leave patients profoundly altered as people. Can there really be a constant soul when people seem to change according to their brains? Henry Marsh will be joined by philosopher John Cornwell (Director of the Science and Human Dimension Project at Jesus College, University of Cambridge) and Baroness Susan Greenfield (Director of the Royal Institution and Professor of Pharmacology, University of Oxford). They will explore what happens in our brain when we have a belief, religious or not. Is belief hard-wired in our genes or an evolutionary strategy? Baroness Greenfield will look at the issue of studying belief scientifically and some possible applications. For example, there is the possibility of treating pain with belief – either secular (placebo) or religious – instead of with drugs. John Cornwell takes a different view. He’ll argue that even if science can produce an objective brain scan of belief, there are crucial subjective aspects of our belief experience that science can’t get at.

Marina Tzakosta is a Ph.D. student in the University of Leiden Center for Linguistics.", "keywords": "Linguistics,Phonology, Stress, Greek", "body": "The present talk focuses on the acquisition of word stress in Greek and the\r\ndegree to which stress assignment is phonologically and/or morphologically\r\nconditioned. The Greek child data demonstrate that children acquire stress\r\nin less predictable ways than Dutch (cf. Fikkert 1994) or English (cf.\r\nDemuth and Fee 1995, Pater 1997) children. More specifically, child speech\r\ndisplays variable and overlapping patterns in children's productions. For\r\nexample, trochees and iambs are equally produced for target words with\r\nambiguous metrical structure. Moreover, children tend to be unfaithful to\r\ncertain biases, such as the trochaic prosodic word minimum. I argue that\r\nthis is attributed to the unpredictable nature of the accentual system of\r\nGreek.

Biographies:\r\n\r\nThe Comedy Research Project are science comedians Dr Helen Pilcher and Timandra Harkness. They first met when performing stand-up comedy one night in a club. Some time later both were surprised to be reunited at a scientific meeting and discovered that they had a common interest in science.\r\n\r\nHelen Pilcher writes daily on-line news for _Nature_. She has also genetically engineered a series of stem-cell lines for transplantation into the degenerative brain, and was a finalist in the BBC New Comedy Awards.\r\n\r\nTimandra Harkness can be seen on BBC4's _Mind Games_ and an Open University television programme about the Theory of Everything. She is currently writing a feature film about a man going to Mars.\r\n\r\nh3. Getting to the Dana Centre:\r\n\r\nNearest tube: Gloucester Road.  There is no parking at the Dana Centre (except for disabled drivers).  Residents’ parking restrictions apply until 10:00pm.\r\n\r\nh3. Notes to Editors:\r\n\r\n# The Dana Centre is a collaboration between the Science Museum, the BA (British Association for the Advancement of Science) and The European Dana Alliance for the Brain (EDAB) making it unrivalled in its expertise and depth of knowledge of scientific and technological fields. The Centre is housed in the Wellcome Wolfson Building alongside the headquarters of the BA, EDAB and Science Museum offices.\r\n# The £9.8 million building has been provided by four major benefactors – the Wellcome Trust, the Wolfson Foundation, The Dana Foundation and the Garfield Weston Foundation.\r\n# The Science Museum exists to promote the public understanding of the history and contemporary practice of science, medicine, technology and industry. It aims to inspire, educate and involve visitors. It achieves this by building, researching and caring for the national collections; and by interpreting these collections and engaging the public in the contemporary issues they raise.\r\n# The BA is the UK's nationwide, open membership organisation dedicated to connecting science with people, so that science and its applications become accessible to all. The BA aims to promote openness about science in society and to engage and inspire people directly with science and technology and their implications.\r\n# The goal of EDAB is to inform the general public and decision makers about the importance of brain research. EDAB aims to advance knowledge about the personal and public benefits of neuroscience and to disseminate information on the brain, in health and disease, in an accessible and relevant way.\r\n",
