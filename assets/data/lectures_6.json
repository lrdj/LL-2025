From the end of the 18th century, the next generations attended Habsburg universities: from Lemberg/Lwów and Kraków to Vienna and Pest. Jewish surgeons and physicians influenced Galician life far beyond their medical talents. They served as intercessors (shtadlanim) for their communities; later, many nineteenth-century medical practitioners advocated religious and civic reforms. Their literary expressions—in German, Hebrew, or Polish—provoked fierce debates or reflections.

In this presentation, I will discuss how two very different forms of community emerge and are sustained on the site: user communities and fan communities.\r\n\r\nUser communities are the original form of YouTube community, with users engaging each other around particular topics of interest. These communities form without a central figure and are therefore more dependent on the individual contributions of users, as well as user-generated topics of discussion and argument, to sustain interaction. I will discuss how ‘drama’ — ongoing antagonistic debate — can serve as a way to generate content in these communities and serve a cohesive function.\r\n\r\nBy contrast, fan communities have become increasingly important to success on YouTube, as YouTubers (YouTube video content creators) rely on communities to spread content and generate revenue through viewing videos and purchasing merchandise promoted by the YouTuber. I will discuss how YouTubers engage communities through second person address in the production of videos and how this address, combined with video content from the day-to-day life of the YouTuber, creates a sense of involvement in ongoing video narrative.\r\n\r\nIn comparing these two communities, I will reflect on how YouTube, and social media more generally, affords engagement in ongoing, episodic narratives, with varying levels of engagement and agency, and how YouTube communities shift and develop over time, as the online environment changes.\r\n\r\n!/assets/images/2057.jpg!\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 60, "image_id": 1508, "added": "2014-03-18T12:11:11", "slug": "frenemies-and-fans-the-emergence-of-different-youtube-communities", "speakers": [{"id": 10864, "name": "Dr. Stephen Pihlaja", "slug": "dr-stephen-pihlaja"}], "topics": [{"id": 2691, "name": "narrative", "path": "/arts/finearts/film/film/narrative"}, {"id": 3274, "name": "narrative", "path": "/society/psychology/memory/narrative"}, {"id": 1333, "name": "linguistics", "path": "/academic/arts/linguistics/linguistics"}, {"id": 862, "name": "language", "path": "/academic/arts/english/language"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 928, "name": "English, Middlesex University", "slug": "english-middlesex-university", "city": "London", "postcode": "NW4 4BT"}, "organizer": {"id": 928, "name": "English, Middlesex University", "slug": "english-middlesex-university"}, "date": "2014-04-07", "dates": [{"id": 14047, "from_date": "2014-04-07", "to_date": "2014-04-07", "time": "17:00:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": null, "additional_info": "All welcome.

", "keywords": "Technology, Science", "body": "Prometheus was severely punished for giving fire and the arts to mankind, but his loss of liberty was our gain. Just what though is the relationship between technology and freedom? Did washing machines liberate women, or was it feminists who demanded washing machines? In what senses are we – in a gadget-filled world – freer today than 50 or 500 years ago? What might it mean, even, when we talk of being made free?\r\n\r\nFor the developing world, technology has been named ‘the single most transformative tool for development’, while others claim it will destroy – not liberate – traditional communities. Our lives are enriched by technology but we also blame it for taking away our autonomy. The smartphone that makes the daily commute a creative moment is also the device that makes you available 24/7 to the demands of your boss, and indeed your friends. Can we ever be truly free if privacy is a thing of the past, where technology has enabled the accumulation of masses of personal data? Even when there is so much potential to exploit, critics point out that its potential to emancipate humanity might be illusory. But technology is all around us. It makes things faster, smaller, cheaper, and improves how we live, work and entertain. It can empower – removing the shackles of disability and dependency and the housewife’s daily graft. Technology has made travel to the moon and the bottom of the oceans possible, given us artificial hearts and oral contraceptives, mapped our genetic code and even allowed the blind to see again and amputees to run in the Olympics.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, we often seem incapable of handling the change new technology brings. Does it cause a loss of autonomy – or are we more fearful of our inability to withstand change? Should we be much more demanding of what we could get from new kinds of technology? What does the debate about technology say about our sense of purpose and ambition? Perhaps in answering that, we can begin to answer the question of whether or not technology can liberate us, or if the liberated are in the best position to make use of what technology offers.\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 120, "image_id": 1747, "added": "2012-09-13T15:58:02", "slug": "d0b4ed00d17d8cf7", "speakers": [{"id": 12774, "name": "Dr Mo Ibrahim", "slug": "dr-mo-ibrahim"}, {"id": 8367, "name": "Dr Aleks Krotoski", "slug": "dr-aleks-krotoski"}, {"id": 1462, "name": "Professor Andy Miah", "slug": "professor-andy-miah"}, {"id": 12775, "name": "Dr Martyn  Thomas", "slug": "dr-martyn-thomas"}, {"id": 10529, "name": "Professor Judy Wajcman", "slug": "professor-judy-wajcman"}, {"id": 3304, "name": "Mr James Woudhuysen", "slug": "mr-james-woudhuysen"}, {"id": 7443, "name": "David Bowden", "slug": "david-bowden"}], "topics": [{"id": 170, "name": "newtopic", "path": "/science/chemistry/biochemistry/catalysis/newtopic"}, {"id": 910, "name": "science", "path": "/arts/film/documentary/science"}, {"id": 1823, "name": "science", "path": "/academic/religion/religion/science"}, {"id": 169, "name": "catalysis", "path": "/science/chemistry/biochemistry/catalysis"}], "supercategory": "science", "venue": {"id": 2746, "name": "Royal Academy of Engineering ", "slug": "royal-academy-of-engineering", "city": "London", "postcode": "SW1Y 5DG"}, "organizer": {"id": 45, "name": "Institute of Ideas", "slug": "institute-of-ideas"}, "date": "2012-11-22", "dates": [{"id": 11887, "from_date": "2012-11-22", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "19:00:00", "ticket_cost": "£5 (£3)", "ticket_info": "http://www.instituteofideas.com/tickets/battlesatellites2012.html", "additional_info": "Visit www.battleofideas.org.uk for more information.

To counteract the deleterious effects of DNA damage, cells have evolved specialized DNA repair mechanisms. Insights into DNA repair processes and their control has firmly established the importance of DNA repair in ageing and cancer.\r\n\r\nDr Simon Boulton is Senior Research Scientist and group leader of the DNA Damage Response (DDR) Laboratory at Cancer Research UK, London Research Institute, Clare Hall Laboratories and an honorary Professor at University College London. He is a leader in the fields of DNA repair, DNA damage checkpoint signalling and meiosis. Dr Boulton’s lab currently exploits the respective experimental strengths of C. elegans, cultured mammalian cells, mouse models and biochemistry to investigate the DDR. This combination of approaches has led them to make a number of seminal contributions to the field of genome instability and cancer. The current and long-term goals of his lab are to understand how DNA repair processes are regulated in mitotic and meiotic cells.\r\n\r\nThe Francis Crick Lecture is given annually in any field in the biological sciences.

He is responsible for the greatest change in the recorded history of Europe so far: the adoption and patronage by the Roman establishment of the Christian religion. He was acclaimed emperor by his troops in York on the death of his father in 306. His father's main residence had been at Trier and Constantine must have spent much time there both during and after his father's life, before he crossed the Alps with an army in 312 eventually to defeat his western rival outside Rome at the \"Battle of the Milvian Bridge\".

Global ethics should rather be seen as an activity: the attempt to agree on fundamental conditions for human flourishing and to secure them for all. Needless to say that this is an ambitious task; a task that cannot be achieved by one generation. The main challenges for global ethics are: global inequities of an extent impossible to remedy, vast cultural differences in moral perspectives, complex relationships between social, economic and cultural determinants of moral perspectives, lack of global decision-making power with enforcement authority, and – relatedly - no enforceable international agreements with an ethics focus. \r\n\r\nSteps towards achieving the goal of global ethics are increased activity in the areas of conflict resolution and trust building, particularly international networking of existing initiatives; increased intercultural dialogue, strengthening of democratic processes at the international level and adding ethics as an additional factor to already on-going global discussions, for instance , about science and technology policy, trade and the environment, with a view to inform enforceable international agreements by ethical considerations. \r\n\r\nAt this stage, it is far too early to talk about global ethics adequately. The discussions will come naturally to a critical point as a result of more immediate concerns. The first step for the foreseeable future is to include ethics in other discussions, for instance, as an ethical review of major international agreements. Health care ethics, environmental ethics and science and technology ethics are good candidates for development at present.
