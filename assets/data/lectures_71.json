But the virtually exponential growth of recognition and interest in these consumers over the last decades of the twentieth century and first years of the twenty-first has actually hidden the existence of a long and vibrant relationship between LGBTQ people, homosexuality and consumer capitalism since the late nineteenth century. Using sources ranging through early men’s magazines and erotic publications, film and theatre regulations, tabloids and popular newspapers, sources on fashion and retailing, government documents and parliamentary papers, business archives and oral histories, Justin Bengry’s research asks who benefited from commercial interest in homosexuality? And does the pink pound have a history?\r\n\r\nDr Justin Bengry is Lecturer in Queer History at Goldsmiths, University of London where he convenes the world’s first MA in Queer History.

Michlic examines the situation of Jewish child survivors in Poland in the early postwar period. She argues that each of the young survivors had his own or her own special life story that consisted of a unique universe of experiences, interactions, reactions, and beliefs. Yet at the same time, certain patterns in the children’s relations with the adult world in the early postwar period can be delineated, allowing us to conceptualize the macro-history of Jewish child survivors in that period. Starting life anew was a turbulent process, filled with enthusiasm, naiveté, trust, and hope on the one hand, and with fear, uncertainty, and emotional upheaval on the other. Child survivors’ accounts attest to the great vulnerability of children in the adult world not only during the war-time era, but also during the early post-war period.\r\n\r\nSpeaker\r\n\r\nJoanna Beata Michlic is a social and cultural historian, and founder and Director of HBI (Hadassah-Brandeis Institute) Project on Families, Children, and the Holocaust at Brandeis University.

Prior to this archaeological work, even the exact location of the gas chambers was unknown. At Treblinka 1, a labour camp, three unrecorded mass graves were identified, and a previously unidentified survivor from this camp was found and interviewed for the film. When seen in the United States the film was the second highest rated programme for the week, despite the tough nature of the subject.\r\n\r\nThe film was produced by Furneaux and Edgar Productions for Channel 5 and Smithsonian Networks, and directed by Alex Dunlop.

What had been a minor regional school achieved international prominence and influenced the future of European art in general for centuries. Central to this achievement was the genius of a succession of painters from Giovanni Bellini and his brother Gentile, Carpaccio, Giorgione, to the great Titian and his younger contemporaries Tintoretto and Veronese. These painters worked in a city undergoing crisis and change: the decline of its maritime empire, the reduction of its monopoly of trade with the East, its near destruction as a state in the early sixteenth century, and the religious turmoil engendered by the Reformation and the reaction of the Roman Church to it. Governed by an oligarchy of merchant nobles who elected a Doge, Venice remained politically stable throughout this turbulent period and continued to flourish economically. The state, the lay confraternities (called scuole) and private individuals provided sufficient patronage and support for a brilliant school of painting to develop in both secular and religious art. The cultural context and history of this school will be studied in eight lectures, followed by a full-day visit to the National Gallery to consider first-hand its outstanding collection of Venetian renaissance paintings.\r\n \r\n\r\n", "keywords": "arts, art, history, Renaissance Venice, Giovanni Bellini, Antonello da Messina, 'Sacra Conversazione', Titian, public paintings, eligious paintings, Habsburg rulers, Van Dyck, 'Assumption of the Virgin Mary' in the Franciscan church of the Frari, Giorgione, Gabriele Vendramin, Accademia  Gallery in Venice, High Renaissance' style, Alfonso d'Este, of Ferrara, Federico Gonzaga of Mantua, Bacchus and Ariadne' now in the National Gallery, Charles V, King Philip II of Spain, Jacopo Tintoretto,Counter-Reformation", "body": "It was only in the 1550s that Titian's dominance in Venice (which he never left, despite Habsburg solicitations) was challenged.

Veronese produced an altogether more seductive and colour-saturated art for the ruling aristocracy but ultimately was to be cross-examined by the Inquisition despite his high-status protectors. Both outlived Titian, who died during the plague of 1576, never achieving the old master's international success but producing work of exceptional beauty and power in the darkening climate of the Counter-Reformation.", "additional_info": null, "duration": 300, "image_id": null, "added": "2014-05-02T09:34:58", "slug": "a04a1d4ec8713bcb", "speakers": [{"id": 14666, "name": "Dr Michael Douglas-Scott", "slug": "dr-michael-douglas-scott"}], "topics": [{"id": 131, "name": "authors", "path": "/arts/literature/fiction/british/21stcentury/authors"}, {"id": 106, "name": "wwi", "path": "/arts/books/history/military/wwi"}, {"id": 107, "name": "wwii", "path": "/arts/books/history/military/wwii"}, {"id": 108, "name": "army", "path": "/arts/books/history/military/army"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 2725, "name": "The University Women's Club", "slug": "the-university-womens-club", "city": "London", "postcode": "W1K 1DB"}, "organizer": {"id": 2290, "name": "THE COURSE", "slug": "the-course"}, "date": "2014-11-27", "dates": [{"id": 14178, "from_date": "2014-11-27", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "10:45:00", "ticket_cost": "£46", "ticket_info": "info@thecoursestudies.co.uk", "additional_info": "visit www.thecoursestudies.co.uk", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 2725, "name": "The University Women's Club", "slug": "the-university-womens-club", "city": "London", "postcode": "W1K 1DB"}, "organizer": {"id": 2290, "name": "THE COURSE", "slug": "the-course"}}]}, {"id": 13645, "title": "Treasures of the Court / Catherine the Great of Russia (r. 1762–1796)", "synopsis": "Covering 500 years, 38 patrons and several continents, this course is an examination of audacious acts of patronage and how they resulted in some of the finest art collections in the world.\r\n", "keywords": "arts, art, history, royal collections, royal patronage, Russia, Catherine the Great, Diderot's library", "body": "Catherine the Great of Russia (r. 1762–1796)\r\n\r\nIntent on modernising Russia, Catherine the Great built the Hermitage of which she wrote \"[it] contains 38,000 books; there are four rooms filled with books and prints, 10,000 engraved gems (and another 34,000 casts and pastes), roughly 10,000 drawings and a natural history collection that fills two large galleries.\" She also commissioned buildings, statuary, and gardens, founded academies and journals, and libraries, bought Diderot's library, wrote librettos for operas and satirical plays.\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 300, "image_id": null, "added": "2014-05-02T09:31:10", "slug": "03d847cf7ed6e516", "speakers": [{"id": 10856, "name": "Dr Marie-Anne Mancio", "slug": "dr-marie-anne-mancio"}], "topics": [{"id": 131, "name": "authors", "path": "/arts/literature/fiction/british/21stcentury/authors"}, {"id": 106, "name": "wwi", "path": "/arts/books/history/military/wwi"}, {"id": 107, "name": "wwii", "path": "/arts/books/history/military/wwii"}, {"id": 108, "name": "army", "path": "/arts/books/history/military/army"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 2725, "name": "The University Women's Club", "slug": "the-university-womens-club", "city": "London", "postcode": "W1K 1DB"}, "organizer": {"id": 2290, "name": "THE COURSE", "slug": "the-course"}, "date": "2015-03-17", "dates": [{"id": 14152, "from_date": "2015-03-17", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "10:45:00", "ticket_cost": "£46", "ticket_info": "info@thecoursestudies.co.uk", "additional_info": "visit www.thecoursestudies.co.uk", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 2725, "name": "The University Women's Club", "slug": "the-university-womens-club", "city": "London", "postcode": "W1K 1DB"}, "organizer": {"id": 2290, "name": "THE COURSE", "slug": "the-course"}}]}, {"id": 13609, "title": "Treasures of the Court / Philip IV of Spain (r. 1621–1665)", "synopsis": "Covering 500 years, 38 patrons and several continents, this course is an examination of audacious acts of patronage and how they resulted in some of the finest art collections in the world.\r\n", "keywords": "arts, art, history, royal collections, royal patronage, Philip IV of Spain, 1621–1665, Palacio del Buen Retiro, Velázquez\r\n", "body": "Philip IV of Spain (r. 1621–1665)\r\n\r\nPhilip IV is not remembered for his leadership in politics but for his lavish patronage of the arts and letters.

The answer is becoming more difficult and more urgent to find.\r\n\r\nFor all information about this free public lecture by Professor William Ayliffe, please visit the event's page on the Gresham College website - http://www.gresham.ac.uk/lectures-and-events/return-of-the-microbes-how-infections-are-once-more-taking-over", "additional_info": null, "duration": 60, "image_id": 2028, "added": "2013-10-28T20:34:26", "slug": "908b8bed62ba8e81", "speakers": [{"id": 8819, "name": "Professor William Ayliffe", "slug": "professor-william-ayliffe"}], "topics": [{"id": 170, "name": "newtopic", "path": "/science/chemistry/biochemistry/catalysis/newtopic"}, {"id": 910, "name": "science", "path": "/arts/film/documentary/science"}, {"id": 1823, "name": "science", "path": "/academic/religion/religion/science"}, {"id": 3275, "name": "science", "path": "/arts/literature/fiction/science"}], "supercategory": "science", "venue": {"id": 500, "name": "Museum of London", "slug": "museum-of-london", "city": "London", "postcode": "EC2Y 5HN"}, "organizer": {"id": 20, "name": "Gresham College", "slug": "gresham-college"}, "date": "2014-01-29", "dates": [{"id": 13676, "from_date": "2014-01-29", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "18:00:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": null, "additional_info": "You do not need to register for this free public event.

This angers environmental campaigners who argue such escalation will prevent the UK from meeting its legally binding climate targets. Meanwhile the rest of Northern Europe is moving away from gas in favour of renewables. \r\n\r\nBut does Osborne have a point? Stateside, the US’s fracking boom opened plentiful ‘unconventional’ gas reserves resulting in cheaper natural gas prices for consumers as well as a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. And could the construction of new gas power stations not help us meet emissions targets and enable a smooth transition to the low-carbon energy system we all need? \r\n\r\nJoin us to discuss the issue and hear expert opinions from both sides of the debate. You are invited to stay on for some networking at the HUB after the event until 9pm, after when we will move on to a nearby bar. \r\n\r\nGuest speakers:\r\nDanielle Paffard, Co-founder of Move Your Money UK & No Dash for Gas Activist \r\nDanielle has been involved in UK Uncut and recently started the Move Your Money campaign in the UK, a national campaign to spread the message that individuals can help to build a better banking system through their buying power. Danielle has been involved in climate change campaigning for several years and is a key member of the No Dash for Gas activist group, which last year occupied a chimney at the West Burton EDF gas power plant for eight days, generating intense debate and media interest on the issue.\r\nAlistair Harper, Green Alliance Senior Policy Adviser\r\nGreen Alliance is the UK’s leading environmental think tank working to ensure ambitious solution to environmental problems.

Predominantly homosexual, Maugham made a disastrous marriage to Syrie Wellcome, although deeply in love with the charming but dissolute Gerald Haxton. It was partly to escape his wife that Maugham undertook the extensive journeys in the Far East that inspired so many of his memorable short stories.

Overfishing of reef associated species, destructive fishing practices, coastal development and pollution have severely degraded reefs worldwide and significantly decreased their resilience to disease and the impacts of climate change.\r\n\r\nIn 1998 the world's first mass-bleaching event occurred, killing in one stroke an estimated 16% of all the world's coral reefs. Increasing global temperatures resulting from increases in anthropogenic carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases means that the frequency of such events will increase in the next 50 to 100 years.\r\n\r\nThe oceans are also absorbing much of this excess carbon dioxide, making them more acidic and lowering the concentration in seawater of aragonite, the form of calcium carbonate that corals build their skeletons from.

Language is the main channel in which human beings share the contents of their consciousness. It thereby offers a window into human nature, revealing the hidden workings of our thoughts, our emotions, and our social relationships. Pinker explores an example of each: everyday metaphor as a window into human cognition; swearing and taboo words as a window into human emotion; and indirect speech-veiled threats and bribes, polite requests, and sexual come-ons-as a window into human relationships. And, with this book, he also shows just how stimulating and entertaining language can be.\r\n\r\nSteven Pinker is the Johnstone Family Professor in the Department of Psychology at Harvard University. Until 2003, he taught in the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences at MIT.

The book includes contributions from five former UK Foreign Secretaries who provide a unique insight into the thoughts and actions of the holders of one of the most difficult and challenging posts within British government, highlighting the problems faced during their time as Foreign Secretary and giving a personal account of how these problems were tackled. Professor Lord William Wallace writes the introductory chapter and a conclusion considering New Labour's foreign policy is provided by Professor Christopher Hill and Tim Oliver. The book can be purchased on Amazon or at the event where it will be available at a special reduced rate.\r\n\r\nIn the debate the speakers will examine the foreign policy challenges that Britain and the next Prime Minister faces and will discuss how best to address these. Following a decade in which Britain under the leadership of Tony Blair has adopted a remarkably activist foreign policy, should Britain look to review its relationship with the US as the presidency of George Bush comes to an end? What role should Britain play in Europe? How should Britain move forward in Iraq and the wider Middle East? And does UK foreign policy need a \"complete renaissance\" to tackle \"Reactionary Islam\" as called for by Blair in one of his recent major foreign policy speeches?\r\n\r\nLord Howe was Margaret Thatcher's longest standing Cabinet minister, serving as Chancellor of the Exchequer, Foreign Secretary and Leader of the House of Commons.

This goal must be met while ensuring that people live in comfort and our economy flourishes.  There is no single answer.  It is obvious that there is huge scope for reductions in energy demand, both through improved efficiency of energy use and through evolving lifestyles and patterns of behaviour.  But motivating and coordinating the actions of millions of citizens is a daunting task.  On the supply side, renewable technologies offer much as, potentially, does nuclear power and the capture of carbon from power stations emissions.  But, again, ensuring the environmental integrity of these options giving incentives for investment is critical.  The ultimate challenge is to break the link between transport, oil and carbon.  This lecture will explore these issues and point towards options for moving forwards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 120, "image_id": null, "added": "2007-02-16T10:09:34", "slug": "conservation-and-sustainability-secure-energy-and-a-stable-climate-how-possible-is-it", "speakers": [{"id": 4770, "name": "Professor   Jim Skea", "slug": "professor-jim-skea"}], "topics": [{"id": 1001, "name": "sustainability", "path": "/science/biology/sustainability/sustainability"}, {"id": 868, "name": "climate", "path": "/science/climatechange/climate"}, {"id": 158, "name": "sustainability", "path": "/science/biology/sustainability"}, {"id": 752, "name": "conservation", "path": "/science/naturalhistory/conservation"}], "supercategory": "science", "venue": {"id": 1268, "name": "Room B04, Birkbeck", "slug": "room-b04-birkbeck", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC1H 0PD"}, "organizer": {"id": 1069, "name": "Ecology and Conservation Studies Society", "slug": "ecology-and-conservation-studies-society"}, "date": "2007-02-16", "dates": [{"id": 3932, "from_date": "2007-02-16", "to_date": "2007-02-16", "time": "18:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": null, "additional_info": "For any queries, please contact e-mail:   wright@britishlibrary.net;  tel:  020 7485 7903,\r\n   or contact e-mail:   h.atkinson@bbk.ac.uk ;  tel:  020 7679 1069", "members_only": "No", "members_info": "Details of the Society and application forms will be available at the door, and are on our website http://www.bbk.ac.uk/ce/environment/   [follow the link]", "venue": {"id": 1268, "name": "Room B04, Birkbeck", "slug": "room-b04-birkbeck", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC1H 0PD"}, "organizer": {"id": 1069, "name": "Ecology and Conservation Studies Society", "slug": "ecology-and-conservation-studies-society"}}]}, {"id": 3906, "title": "Minding the gap: Touching time with Winnicott, Jung and Lacan", "synopsis": "This lecture explores the dynamics of presence and absence in the psychotherapeutic experience.", "keywords": "Jung, Lacan, Winnicott, psychotherapy, Edinburgh, Guild of Pastoral Psychology", "body": "For Jung the transcendent informs the ground of our being and he writes of the religious instinct as central to the process of individuation.

Anyone watching them may be tempted to think they’re alive,” adds Sarah.\r\n\r\n“But are they really sensate beings or simply dancing pixels on the screen?” Senster is a thrilling spectacle that throws the audience into the debate.” \r\n\r\nThroughout the show, actors and musicians will also use highly unusual acoustic curiosities to provoke these artificial creatures into action.  Musical highlights include live performances on the theremin (the B-movie favourite that is played without touching) and the haunting, aquatic sounds of the waterphone. Senster is also the world’s first show to loop samples, live, from a 1900s Edison Phonograph.  \r\n\r\nThe event is taking place on Thursday 28 September, 19.00-20.30 at the Science Museum’s Dana Centre, a venue renowned for groundbreaking and innovative events for adults on science, medicine, technology and the environment.\r\n\r\nKat Nilsson, Events Manager at the Dana Centre said: “Through this piece, participants experience a chilling introduction to music technology and the science of life, both real and artificial. At the Dana Centre we aim to inspire people about science in innovative and unique ways. We hope Senster will prompt them to think about sound in a new way and to question what it means to be a living creature”.\r\n\r\nSenster has been made possible by a Wellcome Trust engaging science People Award.\r\n\r\nWARNING: Infrasound\r\nInfrasound is used throughout this show. Infrasound is extremely deep, bass sound. It’s so low in pitch, you may feel it rather than hear it. We will be taking care to limit the infrasound to safe levels. However, if you are pregnant, suffer from heart problems or are in any way uncomfortable about experiencing infrasound, we shall give you an opportunity to leave the room.\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 129, "added": "2006-09-08T14:30:29", "slug": "senster", "speakers": [{"id": 4220, "name": "TBC", "slug": "tbc"}], "topics": [{"id": 170, "name": "newtopic", "path": "/science/chemistry/biochemistry/catalysis/newtopic"}, {"id": 942, "name": "debate", "path": "/arts/books/poetry/debate"}, {"id": 910, "name": "science", "path": "/arts/film/documentary/science"}, {"id": 169, "name": "catalysis", "path": "/science/chemistry/biochemistry/catalysis"}], "supercategory": "science", "venue": {"id": 15, "name": "Dana Centre", "slug": "dana-centre", "city": "London", "postcode": "SW7 5HE"}, "organizer": {"id": 46, "name": "Science Museum", "slug": "science-museum"}, "date": "2006-09-28", "dates": [{"id": 3444, "from_date": "2006-09-28", "to_date": "2006-09-28", "time": "19:00:00", "ticket_cost": "FREE", "ticket_info": "Tickets are FREE but must be pre-booked on: 020 7942 4040 or tickets@danacentre.org.uk\r\n", "additional_info": null, "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 15, "name": "Dana Centre", "slug": "dana-centre", "city": "London", "postcode": "SW7 5HE"}, "organizer": {"id": 46, "name": "Science Museum", "slug": "science-museum"}}]}, {"id": 3303, "title": "Believe in God Today: Experience, Imagination and Faith", "synopsis": "Dr. David Tacey is the author of eight books and eighty-five published essays on spirituality, Jungian psychology and cultural studies.", "keywords": "David Tacey, Scientific and Medical Network, imagination, faith, religion, postmodern philosophy, philosophy, spirituality, Jung, How to Read Jung, The Spirituality Revolution, reenchantment, God.", "body": "We seem to be emerging from a time of disbelief in and refusal of the old image of God, and entering a new phase of culture, where the idea of God has become respectable again, but in an entirely new way.

Chaired by Alice Beard.\r\n\r\nItalian designed scooters, the Vespa and Lambretta, stand out as some of the most innovative pieces of transportation design in the 20th century and they continue to be regarded as symbols of freedom and independence. In Britain however, the scooter has always had a very close relationship with style, image, fashion, music and its history reflects our ever evolving social landscape.\r\nTo coincide with the Ready Steady Go! Scooter Style & Urban Dreams exhibition at Chelsea Space gallery the curators have invited a number of specialists on contemporary cultural styles to explore just some aspects of that ‘labyrinth’ of associations and connections between the scooter, design and personal identity.\r\n\r\nScooters were adopted by the Mods of the 1960s and their style is still influencing the new generation of Mods.  Richard Barnes contribution to the talk will explore the musical taste of the Mods and the powerful role it played in creating this sub cult. \r\n\r\nAlfredo Marcantonio, an advertising creative director with a string of awards to his name, was an original Mod and lived the lifestyle of a true Mod, which included riding a scooter. He will revisit some of the key moments of his early life and give us a flavour of what it was really like.\r\n\r\nBlack style was a powerful influence amongst the early London \"modernists\" and continues to be a firm favourite with the scooterist of today.  \r\n\r\nCarol Tulloch will use rare archive photographs to depict black youth involvement with subcultures of this period.\r\n\r\nAlistair O'Neill will consider the influence of post war Italy on the lifestyles of Britain in the 1950s, including eating, drinking and transportation - in the form of the scooter.\r\n\r\nThe earliest scooters were designed to meet the imagined needs of the female motorcyclist. When the scooter was first mass marketed women were key targets as purchasers and they quickly became enthusiastic participants in the rallies and club events in those early days. Over time though, they were increasingly relegated to the pillion seat. \r\n\r\nSusan Holder, co curator of Ready Steady Go! will talk about women and scooters with examples from the exhibition loans.\r\n\r\nMore about the speakers:\r\nAlistair O'Neill is a writer, curator and Research Fellow at the London College of Fashion.

Rather than focusing on preserving, studying and presenting their collections, museums may now be required to take on a variety of social functions - including social inclusion, lifelong learning and recognising group identities. Has taking on these tasks left the museum overburdened and confused about its role? Can and should museums make people feel better and affirm their identity? Are scholarship and the collection under threat? Museums' right to retain or interpret artifacts from non-western societies has also been challenged. Some argue for repatriation, or the involvement of indigenous groups in interpreting objects and designing exhibitions. Who owns culture? Is there a danger we close down understanding if only one selected group can speak about culture? What is the role of the curator, and who should decide what we collect in the future?\r\n\r\nThis conference will explore the new roles of the museum, examining their intellectual roots and consequences.

Meet\r\nat 4pm in front of the picture in Room 44. \r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 30, "image_id": 54, "added": "2004-04-20T01:05:26", "slug": "c2b5edb89ac570b2", "speakers": [{"id": 532, "name": "gallery staff", "slug": "gallery-staff"}], "topics": [{"id": 286, "name": "rousseau", "path": "/arts/painting/rousseau"}, {"id": 117, "name": "painting", "path": "/arts/painting"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 184, "name": "National Gallery", "slug": "national-gallery", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC2N 5DN"}, "organizer": {"id": 184, "name": "National Gallery", "slug": "national-gallery"}, "date": "2004-05-28", "dates": [{"id": 438, "from_date": "2004-05-28", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "16:00:00", "ticket_cost": "Free, no tickets required", "ticket_info": null, "additional_info": "Meet at 4pm in front of the picture in Room 44.\r\n\r\nTel: 020 7747 2885 for public enquiries.\r\n\r\nTel: 020 7747 2596 for press information.", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 184, "name": "National Gallery", "slug": "national-gallery", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC2N 5DN"}, "organizer": {"id": 184, "name": "National Gallery", "slug": "national-gallery"}}]}, {"id": 270, "title": "The Big Bang", "synopsis": "Authors Em and Lo answer everything you ever wanted to know about sex but were afraid to ask.", "keywords": "sex", "body": "These events will not take place in-store, please call the branch for venue details.", "additional_info": null, "duration": null, "image_id": 41, "added": "2004-04-04T17:44:51", "slug": "48d3918cffa856eb", "speakers": [{"id": 367, "name": "Em and Lo .", "slug": "em-and-lo"}], "topics": [{"id": 185, "name": "sex", "path": "/leisure/sex"}], "supercategory": "leisure", "venue": {"id": 130, "name": "Borders UK Ltd", "slug": "borders-uk-ltd", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC2H 0JR"}, "organizer": {"id": 130, "name": "Borders UK Ltd", "slug": "borders-uk-ltd"}, "date": "2004-04-28", "dates": [{"id": 271, "from_date": "2004-04-28", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "19:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": null, "additional_info": null, "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 130, "name": "Borders UK Ltd", "slug": "borders-uk-ltd", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC2H 0JR"}, "organizer": {"id": 130, "name": "Borders UK Ltd", "slug": "borders-uk-ltd"}}]}, {"id": 42, "title": "Risk Is Not Just A Four-Letter Word", "synopsis": "Professor Wolff takes a scientific view of risk and argues that many current views of risk are deficient.", "keywords": "risk, ergonomics, ", "body": null, "additional_info": null, "duration": 120, "image_id": 0, "added": "2004-03-23T11:30:00", "slug": "risk-is-not-just-a-four-letter-word", "speakers": [{"id": 51, "name": "Professor Heinz Wolff", "slug": "professor-heinz-wolff"}], "topics": [{"id": 71, "name": "physics", "path": "/science/physics"}], "supercategory": "science", "venue": {"id": 7, "name": "Ergonomics Society", "slug": "ergonomics-society", "city": "Loughborough", "postcode": "LE11 3DW"}, "organizer": {"id": 7, "name": "Ergonomics Society", "slug": "ergonomics-society"}, "date": "2004-02-24", "dates": [{"id": 42, "from_date": "2004-02-24", "to_date": "2004-02-24", "time": "19:00:00", "ticket_cost": "free", "ticket_info": null, "additional_info": "Please note this talk takes place in the Great Hall, Friends House, 173 Euston Road, London NW1 2BJ (opposite Euston station)", "members_only": "No", "members_info": "http://www.ergonomics.org.uk", "venue": {"id": 7, "name": "Ergonomics Society", "slug": "ergonomics-society", "city": "Loughborough", "postcode": "LE11 3DW"}, "organizer": {"id": 7, "name": "Ergonomics Society", "slug": "ergonomics-society"}}]}]
