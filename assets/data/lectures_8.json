Although these events are rare, they have shaped the Universe we live in – creating most of the elements of which we, the planets, and all current stars are made of. They can, however, also help us to probe star formation in the Universe by utilising there short, rock and roll, lifetimes, and the immense brightness of each explosion, leading us back in time to galaxies more and more distant. I will specifically look at the role of supernovae in helping to probe the differences in star formation within normal spiral galaxies, like the Milky Way, and colliding galaxy systems, like the Antennae galaxy, by analysing over 400 galaxies in the local Universe containing these explosions.

Katja’s practice-led research explores the relation of body, movement and environment, and draws on her experience in improvisation, somatic practices and choreology. It currently focuses on performer-audience interactions and algorithmic performance. In addition, Katja has taught at Birkbeck, Laban, The Place, Theatre Academy of Helsinki, ISLO, University of Kent, and Bartlett School of Architecture, UCL.\r\nNic Sandiland is a UK based artist whose work focuses on choreography through the areas of installation, performance and film. He originally trained as an electronics engineer before studying dance and performance in the late 80s.\r\nOver the past 20 years he has created movement-based works focusing on simple pedestrian choreography, as termed by artists such as Yvonne Rainer and Trisha Brown. He is particularly interested in engaging the everyday movements of the viewer in a choreographic context and since 2000 has increasingly employed interactive digital technology to do this. Recent work has drawn on cinematic techniques, such as slow motion and moving camera mechanisms, as ways to elevate the mundane and often overlooked choreography of everyday life.\r\nNic has taught workshops on digital technology and dance around the world including Bangalore, India, Seoul, and South Korea.

In 2007 the opportunity arose to become Research Assistant for a pilot project led by Professor Roberta Gilchrist, University of Reading, assessing the archives from the 1908 – 1979 excavations at Glastonbury Abbey. This informed a major four-year research project culminating in a Monograph (forthcoming Gilchrist and Green 2014) publishing exciting new evidence resulting from the re-analysis of the historic excavations, extensive new geophysical survey and specialist assessments of the finds assemblages. Cheryl has now returned to Context One Archaeological Services, Somerset, as post-excavation manager and buildings archaeologist.\r\n\r\n 11.45 – 12.30     Break\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n12.30 – 1.00     Johnny McFadyen (PhD Student, University of Bristol)\r\n                            ‘Arthur in the Medieval West’\r\n\r\n“I'm just finishing my PhD on Latin Arthurian literature at the University of Bristol (and may even be done by the time the event comes round *fingers crossed*).

But the lecture will suggest that by attending to some of the less obvious literary characteristics of Newman's writing, we can perhaps still draw some inspiration from it about the most effective ways to characterise the intellectual purposes of universities in the face of contemporary demands for 'usefulness'.", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 1511, "added": "2011-03-08T16:50:49", "slug": "the-idea-of-the-university-newman-and-now", "speakers": [{"id": 3790, "name": "Professor Stefan Collini", "slug": "professor-stefan-collini"}], "topics": [{"id": 718, "name": "literature", "path": "/academic/literature"}, {"id": 1518, "name": "religion", "path": "/academic/religion"}, {"id": 349, "name": "history", "path": "/academic/history"}, {"id": 2467, "name": "historyofeducation", "path": "/academic/history/historyofeducation"}], "supercategory": "academic", "venue": {"id": 1103, "name": "School of Advanced Study, University of London", "slug": "school-of-advanced-study-university-of-london", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC1E 7HU"}, "organizer": {"id": 1103, "name": "School of Advanced Study, University of London", "slug": "school-of-advanced-study-university-of-london"}, "date": "2011-05-03", "dates": [{"id": 9971, "from_date": "2011-05-03", "to_date": "2011-05-03", "time": "18:00:00", "ticket_cost": "Free to attend", "ticket_info": "Please RSVP to manjeet.sambi@sas.ac.uk", "additional_info": "For further information and to reserve your place please contact manjeet.sambi@sas.ac.uk", "members_only": "No", "members_info": "All welcome", "venue": {"id": 1103, "name": "School of Advanced Study, University of London", "slug": "school-of-advanced-study-university-of-london", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC1E 7HU"}, "organizer": {"id": 1103, "name": "School of Advanced Study, University of London", "slug": "school-of-advanced-study-university-of-london"}}]}, {"id": 9455, "title": "Inaugural Lecture: Prof. Laurie Cohen - Imagining careers ", "synopsis": "Many people take the concept of career for granted.

Spirit visitation can happen at anytime, anywhere to anyone.  So much so, that countless people have made claims that they have witnessed a deceased family member visit them from the grave. What is a visitation? It really depends on the circumstances of your life at the time of the visitation. Have you recently lost a loved one? Have you moved into a new home and from the very beginning were uncomfortable and had that feeling build until you actually saw a spirit or ghost? Have you been afraid to go to sleep and prayed and right after praying felt secure and warm?  Who or what is it that you are seeing or experiencing? Interpreting a visitation as being a ghost or an angel or a family member very much depends on the state of mind of the person experiencing the visitation and the environment in which it occurs.

This talk explores how many contemporary artists use and cite different forms of technology as a way of proposing a state of unbelonging.  This state is not accompanied by any affect of sadness, but rather one of liminality and demetaphorization that forms an unidentifiable relation, or at least living with the other with whom no identification can take place.  Senses are then the very matter of sharing and division, attraction and repulsion, and the decision to be part of collective sensual labor. Commonality can only be found then as it is sensed as coming undone through non-identification, demetaphorization, unworking, and the sense of the liminal. The sight of the face, the reception of a letter, or participation in a conversation become less an opening to familairity and dialogue than a shared sense of belonging as enslavement,  and the sense of unbelonging. \r\n\r\nRanjana Khanna is a Professor of English, Literature, & Women's Studies and Margaret Taylor Smith Director of Women's Studies at Duke University.

Johnson presents the answers to these questions and more in his infectious, culturally omnivoracious style, using examples from thinkers in a range of disciplines – from Charles Darwin to Tim Berners-Lee – to provide the complete, exciting, and encouraging story of inspiration.\r\n\r\nHe identifies the five key principles to the genesis of great ideas, from the cultivation of hunches to the importance of connectivity and how best to make use of new technologies. Most exhilarating is his conclusion: with today’s tools and environment, radical innovation is extraordinarily accessible to those who know how to cultivate it.

Tonight's talk looks at the Black Sun from a post-chaos perspective, charting the historical development of this archetype's psycho-cultural significance, then explore its contemporary relevance, suggesting various magical techniques of personal and wider use.

Rogers.\r\n\r\nSpecies adapt to the environment over millennia, and reproduction is therefore highly controlled by environment, but what happens when the environment changes more quickly than expected? Will reproduction go wrong or is it sufficiently robust to cope?\r\n\r\nThe symposium will examine the ways in which environmental change, such as global warming, increased radiation and exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals, influence not only short-term reproductive success and development, but also long-term survival and fitness. We will focus on the following questions:\r\n\r\n• Will environmental change lead to mismatches between food supplies, optimal physical environments and reproductive demands?\r\n\r\n• How will these changes interact at the population level to cause the collapse or alteration of food web structures?\r\n\r\n• What are the direct effects of environmental stresses (e.g. temperature, drought, environmental pollutants) on the reproductive success of individuals and populations?\r\n\r\n• To what extent do environmental stresses during early life affect adult health through developmental programming mechanisms?\r\n\r\nIn this symposium, experts in ecology, nutrition, reproductive physiology, developmental biology and molecular biology share their insights into these questions.\r\n\r\nOrganised by William V. Holt, Stuart R. Milligan and Rhiannon E.
