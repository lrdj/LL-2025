How do the features of performance and exhibition intermingle, and how do the specific qualities of each art form and its sites challenge our attention economies? Imposing the “choreographic” as a mode of assignment and spatio-temporal arrangement, I will draw attention to the specifically kinaesthetic qualities the beholder experiences in these settings and further propose an architectural framework within the choreography.\r\n\r\nThis talk is presented alongside Volumes Project, strand of dance and choreographic practice which features as part of the MIRRORCITY exhibition at Hayward Gallery in conjunction with Independent Dance and Trinity Laban.

This talk by Edward Timms will focus more specifically on Jewish ideological support for the German and Austrian war effort, as reflected in the play. Jews who were attempting to assimilate to gentile society sometimes became super-patriots, composing poems or newspaper articles that were even more pro-German (or pro-Austrian) than those by gentiles. They were Outsiders struggling to become Insiders – fully accepted citizens of their chosen nation. Kraus senses that they are trying too hard, not least because of the resistance they encounter, and never quite make it.\r\n\r\nThis frustrated impulse is captured in his play by means of a documentary technique that reproduces – as dramatic monologue or dialogue – the purple prose which over-enthusiastic Jewish authors or journalists have published in their efforts to become super-patriots. There is a particular focus on ‘newspaper language’ – writing that is ‘journalistic’ in the worst sense: distorting the truth in order to gain short-term political or military advantage, and churning out propaganda that sends others to die on the battlefield.\r\n\r\nThis event is part of the conference 'The German Jewish Experience of the First World War' organised by the University of Sussex Centre for German Jewish Studies in partnership with The Wiener Library and the Jewish Museum.", "additional_info": null, "duration": 120, "image_id": null, "added": "2014-06-10T09:09:42", "slug": "2fd87aac40f119a8", "speakers": [{"id": 14808, "name": "Professor Edward Timms", "slug": "professor-edward-timms"}], "topics": [{"id": 106, "name": "wwi", "path": "/arts/books/history/military/wwi"}, {"id": 107, "name": "wwii", "path": "/arts/books/history/military/wwii"}, {"id": 108, "name": "army", "path": "/arts/books/history/military/army"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 1886, "name": "The Wiener Library for the Study of the Holocaust and Genocide", "slug": "the-wiener-library-for-the-study-of-the-holocaust-and-genocide", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC1B 5DP"}, "organizer": {"id": 1886, "name": "The Wiener Library for the Study of the Holocaust and Genocide", "slug": "the-wiener-library-for-the-study-of-the-holocaust-and-genocide"}, "date": "2014-06-12", "dates": [{"id": 14348, "from_date": "2014-06-12", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "18:30:00", "ticket_cost": "This event is free but places are limited and therefore booking is essential.", "ticket_info": "http://www.wienerlibrary.co.uk/Whats-On?item=143", "additional_info": null, "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 1886, "name": "The Wiener Library for the Study of the Holocaust and Genocide", "slug": "the-wiener-library-for-the-study-of-the-holocaust-and-genocide", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC1B 5DP"}, "organizer": {"id": 1886, "name": "The Wiener Library for the Study of the Holocaust and Genocide", "slug": "the-wiener-library-for-the-study-of-the-holocaust-and-genocide"}}]}, {"id": 13490, "title": "Practical Philosophy Introduction", "synopsis": "The ideas we have in our mind about ourselves and the world are of great importance: they either limit us or help us to grow.", "keywords": "Mythology, Philosophy, Perennial Philosophy, Hermetic Teachings, science, Astrology, awareness, history, tradition, Alchemy, Mysticism, Ancient Philosophy, Psychology, Ancient Greece", "body": "Do we really know who we are?

", "keywords": "philosophy", "body": "Philosophers are often accused of having their heads in the clouds and contemplating questions that have nothing to do with real life. On that view the thought experiment looks like a typical philosophical method — speculative, ungrounded infacts and incapable of objectivity. Yet thought experiments are everywhere in philosophy. To give just one (rather alarming) example: imagine you meet a man who you are certain genuinely wants to be killed and eaten. Morally, what should you do? Are you obliged to fulfil his desire? Or forbidden from doing it? Is it your free choice? Do circumstances matter or is it an absolute? You might say such a thing could never happen; then again, perhaps it could. Either way, we can hardly design a scientific experiment to answer these questions. Yet a thought experiment — the part that begins “imagine if…” — gives us a way to think the question though. And the way we think about it may have wider implications. What, for example, do we do about people who want things that we believe are bad for them? Perhaps the thought experiment is the only tool we have to think about ethical issues. Even in more abstract realms, though, it’s very useful. A while ago we blogged about a thought experiment due to Max Black that might cause us to question Leibniz’s Law, a very venerable logical principle. We’ve also blogged about thought experiments in general as well as Thompson’s Lamp, Gettier Problems and no doubt quite a few others. But should we pause before we rush into these thought experiments? What, after all, can they tell us? Do they inevitably merely confirm our prejudices? Are they so simplified, so idealised as to bear little relation to reality? Are they just the work of pampered professors, relaxing in their studies, pretending to discover things without ever getting out of their chairs? Julian Baggini is a philosopher and the author of many popular books on the subject, including one about thought experiments. He edits The Philosophers’ Magazine, writes journalism for a wide selection of UK publications and appears on TV and Radio.

Exciting new insights are having an effect in the spheres of politics and education policy. In America, both the Democrats and Republicans have drawn on new brain research to inform policies relating to families and children. At a conference on early child development and learning at the White House in 1997, then First Lady Hillary Clinton noted that ‘everything we do with a child...determine(s) how their brains are wired’. In 2001 her successor Laura Bush hosted a White House 'Summit on Early Childhood Cognitive Development'. At this she claimed science confirms, ‘What a child experiences from day one to grade one has a direct and profound impact on his future’. In the UK, Minister for Children Margaret Hodge cites scientific evidence for a range of early years initiatives such as SureStart Schemes and Early Excellence Centres. In education, debates about learning styles, creativity and assessment techniques all claim the credibility of evidence from brain science.\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 150, "image_id": 63, "added": "2005-01-18T14:01:18", "slug": "dce57af3ccc60a42", "speakers": [{"id": 1894, "name": "Professor  Guy Claxton", "slug": "professor-guy-claxton"}, {"id": 1895, "name": "Professor Norbert Herschkowitz", "slug": "professor-norbert-herschkowitz"}, {"id": 1896, "name": "Dr Helene Guldberg", "slug": "dr-helene-guldberg"}, {"id": 1897, "name": "Dr Helen Penn", "slug": "dr-helen-penn"}, {"id": 1898, "name": "Bill Lucas", "slug": "bill-lucas"}], "topics": [{"id": 372, "name": "psychology", "path": "/academic/philosophy/psychology"}, {"id": 149, "name": "brain", "path": "/science/psychology/brain"}, {"id": 148, "name": "psychology", "path": "/science/psychology"}], "supercategory": "academic", "venue": {"id": 502, "name": "Dana Centre", "slug": "dana-centre", "city": "London", "postcode": ""}, "organizer": {"id": 45, "name": "Institute of Ideas", "slug": "institute-of-ideas"}, "date": "2005-02-03", "dates": [{"id": 1566, "from_date": "2005-02-03", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "18:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": "020 7942 4040 or email tickets@danacentre.org.uk ", "additional_info": "http://www.instituteofideas.com/events/childbrain2005.html", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 502, "name": "Dana Centre", "slug": "dana-centre", "city": "London", "postcode": ""}, "organizer": {"id": 45, "name": "Institute of Ideas", "slug": "institute-of-ideas"}}]}, {"id": 1499, "title": "Fundamentalism: the Fear and the Rage", "synopsis": "The lecture will focus the reasons for the fear, the threat posed by modernity and the implications for the future.", "keywords": "Karen Armstrong, fundamentalism, religion, secular modernity.", "body": "The speaker,Karen Armstrong, spent seven years as a Roman Catholic nun in the 1960s.
