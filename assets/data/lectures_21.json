[{"id": 16189, "title": "Plato on Tyranny in the Gorgias", "synopsis": "A look at the tyrant and the tyrannical soul in the Gorgias", "keywords": "philosophy, plato, platonism.", "body": "Both the Republic and the Gorgias look at both the internal constitution of a person and that of an organized society. How do we govern ourselves and how should a society govern itself? We explored in our previous session (on the Republic) how a tyrannical society and a tyrannical life arise.\r\n\r\nThe Gorgias is concerned with similar questions. The three main speakers in the dialogue argue with Socrates about the best life to live, and the aims this works towards. In political context of Plato's time Athenian democracy entailed a persuasive power being used by politicians and rhetoricians to persuade the citizens on a course of action. Does this give the most power to rhetoricians, as they can convince others to do what they want?\r\n\r\nEventually the conversation turns to a tyrant as a possible example of someone who gets what they want. But what power does a tyrant posses? Is the life of a tyrant an enviable one, or is he to be pitied? Socrates argues that although a tyrant may do as he pleases, he is unable to obtain what he truly wants, since he is unable to discern the \"good\" - the all-important criterion of human choices.  In the dialogue Polus, a rhetorician who has claimed that a clever rhetorician wields the same power as a tyrant, goes further and says that rhetoric is therefore a more profitable study than philosophy.  We'll read an extract from the dialogue in which Socrates attempts to show Polus that the path of tyranny is the worst possible for a human to follow. After this we should have the best part of an hour to discuss the issues arising.\r\n\r\nNo previous experience of formal philosophy is required.\r\n\r\nEntrance in free, but donations between £3-5 will be welcomed.\r\n\r\nA PDF download of the extract we will be reading is available on our website together with further details of this and other Prometheus Trust's activities: www.prometheustrust.co.uk (the PDF is on the \"London Monday Evenings\" page.)\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 2735, "added": "2018-06-07T13:15:26", "slug": "plato-on-tyranny-in-the-gorgias", "speakers": [{"id": 16088, "name": "Miranda Addey", "slug": "miranda-addey"}], "topics": [{"id": 1822, "name": "philosophy", "path": "/academic/religion/religion/philosophy"}, {"id": 2388, "name": "philosophy", "path": "/arts/literature/philosophy/philosophy"}, {"id": 365, "name": "platonism", "path": "/arts/philosophy/platonism"}, {"id": 316, "name": "philosophy", "path": "/arts/art/philosophy"}], "supercategory": "academic", "venue": {"id": 3106, "name": "Cecil Sharp House", "slug": "cecil-sharp-house", "city": "London", "postcode": "NW1 7AY"}, "organizer": {"id": 2041, "name": "The Prometheus Trust", "slug": "the-prometheus-trust"}, "date": "2018-06-18", "dates": [{"id": 16749, "from_date": "2018-06-18", "to_date": "2018-06-18", "time": "19:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Donation", "ticket_info": null, "additional_info": null, "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 3106, "name": "Cecil Sharp House", "slug": "cecil-sharp-house", "city": "London", "postcode": "NW1 7AY"}, "organizer": {"id": 2041, "name": "The Prometheus Trust", "slug": "the-prometheus-trust"}}]}, {"id": 16147, "title": "Intuition", "synopsis": "You can develop your intuition and make it a real part of your life – and make your life better in virtually every way.", "keywords": "spirituality, spiritual, wisdom, enlightenment, intuition, ", "body": "You can develop your intuition and make it a real part of your life – and make your life better in virtually every way.

Moreover, Darwin is hailed as the immortal great thinker on the subject of evolution, because he alone is recognised as first to take his own discovery of the theory of natural selection forward, with many confirmatory evidences, convincing others of its veracity and importance.\r\nIn this talk, Mike Sutton will challenge this view with new evidence that proves that, pre-1858, Matthew’s book was read by at least seven naturalists. Three of the seven were at the epicentre of influence on Darwin’s and Wallace’s researches and two of those three were personal associates and correspondents of Darwin and Wallace. He will show that Matthew, not Darwin, should be celebrated as solver of the problem of species.\r\nDr Michael \"Mike\" Sutton is Reader in Criminology at Nottingham Trent University (UK), where he teaches Hi Tech Crime and also Crime Reduction and Community Safety.

In World War II the anxiety that the home front might collapse was fuelled by the escalating bomber offensive and the widespread popular belief that urban communities would not be able to withstand the bombing. For the regime, the urban working-class and the Jews were perceived as the greatest potential threat. Issues of race and labour came to play a major part in planning civil defence and coping with the aftermath of bomb attack. For the Allies, the German working class was also regarded as the ‘weak link’ and so working class residential districts became the principal RAF targets. A battle ensued between the two sides over the ‘morale’ of the German workforce.\r\n\r\nRichard Overy is Professor of History at Exeter University.

The development of the Tube was a great engineering achievement, but also responsible for stimulating the development of London as a city. The Tube allowed people to traverse the city in a way which would be impossible by any form of surface transport, and became a global icon of the city, in terms of its roundel ‘logo’, map design, station architecture, and also for its transport model, which in the 1930s became envied and studied around the world. After the war, London Transport changed the demography of the capital by recruiting directly in the Caribbean and Africa for cheap labour to run the Tube and buses at a time of full employment among the native population. Taken together, it is no exaggeration to say that the Underground helped build the London we know today.\r\n\r\nFollowed by: Open question and answer session with Theresa Villiers MP (Minster of State for Transport)\r\n\r\n'Will the Tube make or break London?'\r\n\r\nLondoners seem to have a love-hate relationship with the tube - it is able to infuriate and enchant them in equal measure. To visitors it is both iconic and perplexing. Currently it is undergoing massive change with a hugely ambitious investment and renewal programme.

Historically, bilingual schools have kept boundaries between languages, but more recently, schools are experimenting by using two languages concurrently within the same lesson. One of the most prevalent bilingual pedagogical practices in bilingual education in the 21st century is ‘translanguaging’, which switches the language mode of input and output in the same lesson and which has been adopted as a key modern concept in bilingual classrooms and communities. The practice of translanguaging has implications for assessment. The majority of assessments in schools emphasise assessing academic language proficiency, and this often creates inequitable assessment practices for emergent bilingual learners. One way to create more equitable assessments is to employ translanguaging practices within tests. The focus of the second part of the presentation will be on the literature relating to translanguaging as a mode of bilingual assessment. The concluding part will describe ways in which an international awarding body is attempting to build an understanding of the needs of bilingual learners in order to guide best practice and future developments.", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 1403, "added": "2011-12-01T09:56:59", "slug": "c4fe665664f5b8d8", "speakers": [{"id": 11805, "name": "Dr W Gwyn Lewis", "slug": "dr-w-gwyn-lewis"}, {"id": 9927, "name": "Mr Stuart Shaw", "slug": "mr-stuart-shaw"}, {"id": 11806, "name": "Helen Imam", "slug": "helen-imam"}], "topics": [{"id": 743, "name": "education", "path": "/academic/arts/linguistics/education"}, {"id": 2192, "name": "assessment", "path": "/academic/education/assessment"}, {"id": 744, "name": "education", "path": "/academic/linguistics/education"}, {"id": 745, "name": "education", "path": "/arts/language/education"}], "supercategory": "academic", "venue": {"id": 2302, "name": "Hughes Hall", "slug": "hughes-hall", "city": "Cambridge", "postcode": "CB1 2EW"}, "organizer": {"id": 2297, "name": "Cambridge Assessment Network", "slug": "cambridge-assessment-network"}, "date": "2012-10-24", "dates": [{"id": 10854, "from_date": "2012-10-24", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "15:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Free to attend", "ticket_info": null, "additional_info": "To book a place please contact the Network Team on 01223 553846 or thenetwork@cambridgeassessment.org.uk.", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 2302, "name": "Hughes Hall", "slug": "hughes-hall", "city": "Cambridge", "postcode": "CB1 2EW"}, "organizer": {"id": 2297, "name": "Cambridge Assessment Network", "slug": "cambridge-assessment-network"}}]}, {"id": 10382, "title": "\"Hear voices from a far distance\": The news, Ninos Vascos and Brigadistas in southeast London", "synopsis": "The Marx Memorial Library will be hosting a talk by Andy Brockman on 12th December", "keywords": "Spanish Civil War", "body": " It can be suggested that the Spanish Civil War was the first conflict to receive the kind of intimate, almost real-time, picture-led reporting which is commonplace today.

On the way, the complexities, challenges and contradictions of ideas, policy and practice will be explored critically, in order to demonstrate the underlying need for radical thinking and creative practice in relation to youth crime. It is no longer enough to be constrained either by naive populism or well-meaning liberalism, if we are to address concerns about the problems of youth in ways which are fair, equitable and work in the best interests of all concerned.

Shiller is the Arthur M. Okun Professor of Economics, Department of Economics and Cowles Foundation for Research in Economics, Yale University, and Professor of Finance and Fellow at the International Center for Finance, Yale School of Management. He received his B.A. from the University of Michigan in 1967 and his Ph.D. in economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1972. He has written on financial markets, financial innovation, behavioral economics, macroeconomics, real estate, statistical methods, and on public attitudes, opinions, and moral judgments regarding markets. \r\n\r\nHis 1989 book Market Volatility (MIT Press) is a mathematical and behavioral analysis of price fluctuations in speculative markets. His 1993 book Macro Markets: Creating Institutions for Managing Society's Largest Economic Risks (Oxford University Press) (available via subscribing libraries on Oxford Online) proposes a variety of new risk-management contracts, such as futures contracts in national incomes or securities based on real estate that would permit the management of risks to standards of living. His book Irrational Exuberance (Princeton 2000, Broadway Books 2001, 2nd edition Princeton 2005, and in 15 foreign language editions) is an analysis and explication of speculative bubbles, with special reference to the stock market and real estate. His book The New Financial Order: Risk in the 21st Century (Princeton University Press, 2003, 2004, and in 8 foreign language editions) is an analysis of an expanding role of finance, insurance, and public finance in our future. \r\n\r\nThis event celebrates the publication of Professor Shiller's most recent book The Subprime Solution: How Today's Global Financial Crisis Happened, and What to Do About It, (Princeton University Press, September 2008),  which offers an analysis of the housing and economic crisis and a plan of action against it.\r\n\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 732, "added": "2008-09-19T11:28:24", "slug": "bde53dd6196eb6a0", "speakers": [{"id": 7429, "name": "Robert J.

Scientific and technical knowledge are essential prerequisites for rational priority-setting, informed policy choice, and efficient use of public resources. At the same time, increasing reliance on expertise has removed the work of government further from the possibility of direct citizen access and control. That distancing, in turn, has become a source of widespread public alienation and distrust, leading many to speak of a “democratic deficit” at the heart of Western societies. But what is to be done? The answer lies, I argue, in reconceptualizing the foundations of trust. Trust between rulers and the ruled is not a commodity that one can gain or lose, like money in the bank. Paradoxically, trust is a relationship generated through the very processes that allow democratic publics to express skepticism and voice distrust. To maintain trust between experts and publics requires us to think of democracy as a performance whose scripts call for constant and critical reflection and oversight.\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 120, "image_id": null, "added": "2007-03-09T14:44:06", "slug": "cc2ed09643935d6c", "speakers": [{"id": 5162, "name": "Professor Sheila Jasanoff", "slug": "professor-sheila-jasanoff"}], "topics": [{"id": 1169, "name": "democracy", "path": "/politics/democracy"}], "supercategory": "politics", "venue": {"id": 1290, "name": "The Old Cinema", "slug": "the-old-cinema", "city": "London", "postcode": "W1T 3UW"}, "organizer": {"id": 513, "name": "Centre for the Study of Democracy", "slug": "centre-for-the-study-of-democracy"}, "date": "2007-03-27", "dates": [{"id": 4273, "from_date": "2007-03-27", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "18:00:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": "To attend please, email Suzy Robson s.robson@wmin.ac.uk ", "additional_info": null, "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 1290, "name": "The Old Cinema", "slug": "the-old-cinema", "city": "London", "postcode": "W1T 3UW"}, "organizer": {"id": 513, "name": "Centre for the Study of Democracy", "slug": "centre-for-the-study-of-democracy"}}]}, {"id": 4008, "title": "Who Do You Think You Are?", "synopsis": "Learn about the new science of epigenetics with Dr Wolf Reik.

That greenhouse gas concentrations are increasing is undisputed. That something is happening to climate and it is being caused by human activity can be stated with greater than 97% confidence.

Are we doomed to a life without cheap flights to exotic holiday destinations? Do we have to ration our energy use? Or is there a technical ‘fix’ to the problem? This talk will assert that, in line with current thinking, there is no single thing we can do that will stabilise and eventually reduce the concentration of CO2, but there are lots of big things we can do, each of which gets us part way there. We will take a critical look at some of the possibilities: hybrid vehicles; hydrogen fuel cells; electricity from wind, solar, and nuclear sources; nuclear generated hydrogen; carbon capture and sequestration; use of biomass for fuels and power; and wave/tidal power, to see what might actually work and what is just hype.

Many of them are outstandingly represented in the Museum: painting, sculpture and architecture, metalwork and tapestry, stained glass and maiolica, manuscript illumination and prints. Broader issues crucial to artistic developments are also addressed: political and social structures, Christian thought and devotional practice, the rediscovery of classical antiquity, and patronage. The processes and techniques involved in producing works of art and artefacts are investigated, and related themes such as literature and dress introduced.

In looking at the representation of a group (that of scientists) I drew together diverse literature to consider different ways of making sense of PUS.\r\n\r\nI conducted several empirical projects to look at changing representations of scientists: analysis of secondary data, interviews including a drawing task, an expert interview with a portrait photographer, and content analysis of newspaper images and popular science documentaries.
