He argued for the priority of labour solidarity. But it was not an anarchist International that was created in 1872. Anarchism was born some five years later, when Bakunin was dead. Rather, the adoption of anarchism by the remnants of the IWA marked a breach with Bakuninism.\r\n\r\nBerthier’s account also shows how the International Workers’ Association (IWA) was formed in 1864 by French and British trade unionists and quickly became a forum for socialist discussion over both strategy and goals; how Marx and Engels used bureaucratic manipulation to secure their control over the body and, in so doing, marginalise themselves so completely they ended up expelling the majority of the organisation; that Bakunin came to play a key role in the IWA because he articulated the majority position, what came to be called  “syndicalist”.\r\n\r\nAfter the Paris Commune (1871), Bakunin characterised Marx's ideas as authoritarian, and argued that if a Marxist party came to power its leaders would end up as bad as the ruling class they had fought against. In 1872, the conflict in the First International climaxed with a final split between the two groups at the Hague Congress. This clash is often cited as the origin of the long-running conflict between anarchists and Marxists.\r\n\r\nThis split is sometimes called the ‘red and black divide’, red referring to the Marxists and black referring to the anarchists.

Finally, an overview of the flight trials content for the first two flight phases is presented, concluding with an indication of how the inherent capabilities of the demonstrator aircraft will be developed in the future to achieve an operational capability downstream of the demonstration programme.", "additional_info": null, "duration": 60, "image_id": null, "added": "2016-04-29T12:52:35", "slug": "949d938d42fc71f4", "speakers": [{"id": 16141, "name": "Mr Paddy Bourne", "slug": "mr-paddy-bourne"}, {"id": 16142, "name": "Mr Jon Wiggall", "slug": "mr-jon-wiggall"}, {"id": 16143, "name": "Mr Neil Dawson", "slug": "mr-neil-dawson"}], "topics": [{"id": 3082, "name": "aviation", "path": "/society/transport/aviation"}, {"id": 434, "name": "aviation", "path": "/science/engineering/aviation"}, {"id": 3742, "name": "aerospace", "path": "/academic/transport/aerospace"}, {"id": 1626, "name": "transport", "path": "/society/transport"}, {"id": 4026, "name": "aerospace", "path": "/science/aerospace"}, {"id": 4028, "name": "aerospaceaviation", "path": "/science/aerospace/aerospaceaviation"}, {"id": 4027, "name": "aviation", "path": "/science/aerospace/aviation"}, {"id": 3741, "name": "aerospace", "path": "/academic/aerospace"}, {"id": 4023, "name": "aviation", "path": "/academic/aerospace/aviation"}, {"id": 4024, "name": "flighttest", "path": "/academic/aerospace/flighttest"}], "supercategory": "society", "venue": {"id": 3109, "name": "Royal Aeronautical Society", "slug": "royal-aeronautical-society", "city": "London", "postcode": " "}, "organizer": {"id": 3109, "name": "Royal Aeronautical Society", "slug": "royal-aeronautical-society"}, "date": "2016-05-11", "dates": [{"id": 15885, "from_date": "2016-05-11", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "18:00:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": "www.aerosociety.com/events\r\nconference@aerosociety.com\r\n020 7670 4345", "additional_info": "This lecture will be given by 3 experts from BAE Systems working on this programme.", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 3109, "name": "Royal Aeronautical Society", "slug": "royal-aeronautical-society", "city": "London", "postcode": " "}, "organizer": {"id": 3109, "name": "Royal Aeronautical Society", "slug": "royal-aeronautical-society"}}]}, {"id": 15328, "title": "Exhibition in Focus: The Channel Islands, Nazi persecution and the Holocaust", "synopsis": "This lecture is part of a series of programming designed to highlight aspects of the exhibition, Dilemmas, Choices, Responses: Britain and the Holocaust, co-curated by the Holocaust Educational Trust’s Regional Ambassadors and the Wiener Library", "keywords": "Holocaust, WWII, family history, history, refugees, genocide, library, Museums, war, politics, refugees, lecture, Wiener, Library, exhibition, Channel Islands", "body": "The history of Nazi persecution in the Channel Islands during the German occupation of 1940-1945 has long been marginalised, even within the islands themselves.

The memory of many of these people was not held in high esteem in the decades after the war. Discussion of the Jews deported from the Channel Islands was an even more delicate subject for discussion, as their story potentially involved the tabooed c-word (collaboration). This lecture sheds light on the silence surrounding victims of Nazism in the Channel Islands and gives voice to some of their extraordinary stories.\r\n\r\nThis lecture is part of a series of programming designed to highlight aspects of the exhibition, Dilemmas, Choices, Responses: Britain and the Holocaust, co-curated by the Holocaust Educational Trust’s Regional Ambassadors and the Wiener Library.

Chetwynd’s performances and videos harness elements of folk plays, street spectacles, music videos and surrealist cinema. They generally employ troupes of performers—friends and relatives of the artist—and feature handmade costumes and props. Through meandering, improvisatory and often burlesque dramas, she has ranged across a panoramic range of subjects. Chetwynd’s performances strike a darkly carnivalesque note, and tread an ambiguous line between melodrama, arcane ritual, and pop-cultural spoof.  \r\n\r\nThe artist was shortlisted for the Turner Prize in 2012. Major performances include The Green Room (Nottingham Contemporary, 2014), Home Made Tasers (New Museum, New York, 2011-12), The Visionary Vineyard: Dreaming of Free Energy (Hayward Gallery, London, 2011, part of British Art Show 7: In the Days of the Comet), and A Tax Haven Run By Women (Frieze Projects, Frieze Art Fair, London, 2010).

That association has varied over time.", "keywords": "University, free lecture, Professor Ronald Barnett", "body": "For much of its history, the very term 'university' has been associated with universality of some kind.  Interestingly, that association has varied over time.  \r\n\r\nOriginally, the (mediaeval) university was a 'universitas', a group of self-governing individuals who were more or less equal; and it was also (universally) open to scholars from wherever (across Europe) they might come.  \r\n\r\nSubsequently, the university was a universal institution of all disciplines and more recently the truths established in its knowledge activities were part of a universal sense of truth, and not the truth of a particular sect or clan or ideology.  However, both epistemologically and socially, this intertwining of 'university' and 'universality' has been shot through.\r\n\r\nNow, amid postmodernism and multiculturalism, the very idea of universal truth is viewed with suspicion.  At the same time, each university is enjoined to become itself – to frame its own mission - in a competitive and diverse system of higher education.  Universities are told to be responsive to the needs of each individual student and the particularities of their own localities.  There seem to be no universal criteria that institutions have to fulfil in order to warrant the title of 'university'.\r\n\r\nAgainst this background, I want to venture the heretical claim not just that universality and university can be put together without embarrassment but also that the universal in the university is actually growing.  Spaces are opening for the growth of universalism in the university.  Surprisingly, perhaps, the university is on the cusp of being more a site of universality than ever in its history.\r\n\r\nSpeaker biography\r\nRonald Barnett, Visiting Professor to Institute for Teaching, Innovation and Learning\r\n\r\nRonald Barnett is Emeritus Professor of Higher Education, Institute of Education, University of London.  \r\n\r\nHe is the author of 20 books (10 of which are sole-authored) on the concepts and theory of the university and higher education.

From denouncements of a ‘sick society’ and ‘mindless criminality’ to blaming the closure of youth centres and establishment corruption, commentators have found very different targets, but few deny that the willingness of inner-city youth to destroy their own neighbourhoods indicates the 21st century city somehow fails to nurture communal life.\r\n\r\nFor some, a ‘me first’ consumerist culture has taken root in the very fabric of our troubled cities, creating a pernicious ‘neoliberal’ urbanism. Excessive gentrification and infrastructural failings have led to the creation of French-style ‘banlieues’ in the outer suburbs and detached estates where the worst of the violence occurred. The most ambitious building project of recent years – Renzo Piano’s Shard – has been decried as the symbol of a shattered society, glorifying the power of the financial sector while the rest is left to decay. While few go as far as Victorian reformer Ebenezer Howard’s description of cities as ‘ulcers on the very face of our beautiful island’, many might share his vision of Garden Cities as a solution of civil unrest. Recent thinking in terms of creating ‘healthy’, ‘inclusive’ or ‘eco’ cities has often seen more enlightened urban design as the solution to the modern malaise.\r\n\r\nCommunity responses to the riots, from Birmingham’s Sikhs risking their lives to protect their local temples to Peckham’s ‘peace wall’ , have offered hope for some that all is not yet lost. But how far can urban planning go in fixing the problems of society? Should architects and planners work more closely with communities and citizens to produce ‘liveable’ cities, or will this only frustrate the vision of those seeking to create large-scale urban projects for the future? Is city life now just a matter of avoiding social decay, or is there anything to be rescued in the idea of radical metropolitan transformation?

Since then, the democratic governments have pursued policies aimed at reducing inequality through economic development with relatively high rates of growth throughout most of the period, the provision of over 3 million low cost houses, massive investment in electrification and sanitation in poor areas, land restitution, the creation of a large welfare grant system, and policies on free health care, education, minimum wages and constitutional court rulings forcing government to extend the socio-economic rights prescribed in the constitution.

Each project involves the selection and inscription of these social signifiers upon their respective spaces and the occasional observation of any changes in behaviour.

The task of the student is to gain their hidden wisdom, and traditionally this is done by two methods. Firstly, one learns the symbols -- numerological, symbolical, kabbalistic and archetypal; then one gains their 'gnosis' by entering their mysteries through psychic communion. Today's workshop offers a condensed experience of this time-honoured process for six trumps: High Priestess, Empress, Strength, Temperence, Star and the World. For each, the tutors will first teach the main symbols, then lead exercises to bring it to life, including guided meditation, discussion, and some ritual.

The authors will be invited to start off the evening by reading short excerpts from their work that typifies their own experiences as migrant authors. We will then explore some of the following questions in a roundtable discussion. What modes of expression have migrant writers found to intermediate between where they came from and what they are confronted with in European cultures? What impact does the work of migrant writers have on the politics of multiculturalism in their respective societies? Are the political conditions in their respective countries supportive of artistic work by migrant authors? What explains the interest of the public in migrant literature in contemporary society? How is the work of migrant writers received in their countries of origin?\r\n\r\nKapka Kassabova was born in Bulgaria in 1973 and learned to speak English at the age of 16 when her parents emigrated to New Zealand.

A muslimwoman unveils (2005) deals with the effects of migration on the rights of Muslim women. Its impact on the Dutch migration debate was widely recognised, turning Tahir into a frequent debater in Dutch and Flemish media. She was lauded for her best-selling Prized Possession (2006), which describes the largely sexual strategies of three Pakistani women towards achieving autonomy and dignity. She earned a scholarship from the Dutch Society of Authors. Her novel Lonelinesses (2008) tackles the struggle for identity in a radicalising family of immigrants, giving further proof of Tahir’s sharp-eyed and humoristic observation. Het most recent novel Little Green Riding Hood and the Converted Wolf, was launched in October 2008 and received extremely well in Belgium and the Netherlands.

At the core of Drexler's approach is the manipulation of single atoms and molecules using computer-controlled actuators or probes, which he argues will enable the assembly of \"virtually anything\" from basic raw materials [2]. Widely decried in both the academic scientific community and in a variety of popular science publications and media [3], this \"Drexlarian\" molecular nanotechnology approach has thus yet to be explored or tested experimentally. Nevertheless, at the core of Drexler's approach there is a demonstrably valid idea: the controlled positioning and manipulation of single atoms and molecules using, for example, scanning probe microscopes. The talk will critically assess Drexler's approach to nanotechnology from the perspective of an experimental nanoscientist [4], focussing in particular on the aims and objectives of a recently-funded programme of work [5] on computer-controlled assembly of diamond nanostructures.\r\n\r\n1. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._Eric_Drexler\r\n2. http://pubs.acs.org/cen/coverstory/8148/8148counterpoint.html\r\n3. http://cohesion.rice.edu/NaturalSciences/Smalley/emplibrary/SA285-76.pdf\r\n4. http://www.softmachines.org/wordpress/?p=70\r\n5. http://crnano.typepad.com/crnblog/2008/08/building-digital-matter.html\r\n\r\nThe venue: Room 538, 5th floor (via main lift), Birkbeck College, Torrington Square (which is a pedestrian-only square).

This lavishly illustrated slide lecture will bring them to life, and we will meet goddess-like figures from recent centuries Christian Europe. Fleur Shearman will show allegorical paintings, symbolic works, monumental sculptures – a veritable feast for the eyes. We meet Nature and land as ‘Woman’ as shown in maps, engravings and book frontispieces, with female personifications of the earth’s continents and Pangaea. The talk then turns to Britannia, derived from the Roman goddesses of state power, most notably Minerva and Roma herself. Looking at art and writings on Britannia, we are able to see how she was (and is) perceived by British people over the the recent centuries. Lady Liberty is the final ‘goddess’ of the evening. Her origins are found in the reverse types of Roman coinage, where Libertas holds the cap of the freed slave, and she lives in the modern world in New York’s colossal statue of Liberty Enlightening the World. Liberty’s revolutionary headgear, the bonnet rouge, enjoyed a renaissance in the late 18th-century Revolutionary era, as a symbol of that terrifying but exhilarating tide of freedom.
