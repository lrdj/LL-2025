They promise to put ordinary voters in control, and sideline the self-serving elites.\r\n\r\nSave Democracy – Abolish Voting sets out to offer an alternative way of managing a democracy that will achieve both of these aims in much more effective, and incorruptible way. It is a proposal that takes the best aspects of representative government while also introducing a much more direct and fair link between the citizen and their own government.\r\n\r\nIt is more than just an attack on the crude binary referendums though. It takes a radical route out of the sterile debate around electoral reform, questioning everything that is popularly thought about how democratic decision-making should be done.\r\n\r\nWe have slipped into the comfortable error of confusing government by electoral politics with popular sovereignty. In a less sophisticated age, it may have been the least-worst version of democracy that was available, but in an age of sophisticated communication and feedback monitoring, this is no longer the case.\r\n\r\nIf anything, politics had gradually turned into a retardant, not an accelerant to democracy. Modern electoral systems evolved in a very uneven way in response to particular political pressures. They were rarely ever deliberately designed to apply any sophisticated democratic logic. Instead, the universal franchise often happened in some token way where, we could all join in the illusion of an equal say in our own governance.\r\n\r\nThat token is a ballot paper that gives us control over only a small part of the decision-making chain (e.g. “a parliament”, or only a part of it in the UK’s case) by choosing from a limited set of options that we think we may want – in advance.\r\n\r\nIt shares control over our government very unevenly and unfairly. If we wanted to design a system in a way that helps wealthy and charismatic people con everyone easily, we could barely design anything better.\r\n\r\nThe book, and this talk, attempts to offer a version of democracy that we would choose now if we were starting to create liberal democracy from scratch, knowing what we know about feedback loops and the democratic flaws that have grown more pronounced as electoral government has evolved.\r\n\r\nSave Democracy – Abolish Voting is a meditation on the nature of democracy in the digital age. It concludes with a proposal – a better alternative to electoral democracy for choosing and directing our government fairly and well.\r\n\r\n—\r\n\r\nPaul Evans is a trade union official working in the TV and Motion Pictures industry.\r\n\r\nSave Democracy – Abolish Voting, (2017) was his first book. It draws on a range of life experiences, including the creation of large-scale e-Democracy platforms and programmes, establishing a successful worker co-op software company, union organising and various consultancy roles addressing problems around democracy in the digital age.\r\n\r\nHe lives in London with a wife and two children.\r\n\r\n—\r\n\r\n\r\nEntry £8, £4 concessions (free to Conway Hall Ethical Society members, who should book these tickets in advance via the Book Now button)\r\nEvent is subject to capacity, without exceptions.

In this thrilling narrative, John Rees brings to life the raucous streets of London and the clattering printers’ workshops that stoked the uprising, the actions of the rank and file of the New Model Army and the furious Putney debates where the Levellers argued with Oliver Cromwell for the future of English democracy. This story reasserts the revolutionary nature of the 1642–51 wars and the role of ordinary people in this pivotal moment in history.\r\n\r\nJohn Rees is an historian, broadcaster and campaigner.

The late 15thC saw the establishment of printing firms in trading cities such as Rome and Antwerp. Drawings were regularly commissioned from well-known masters expressly to be etched or engraved for sale. You will look at this relationship and their influence on each other and how changes in printmaking changed the way drawings were executed. Beginning with the early development of the woodcut, niello and intaglio processes, alighting on key draughtsmen and their contributions. You will also look at types of drawing which became suited to printing, why certain methods of drawing were not suited to print production, and those types of drawing that directly affected print production.", "additional_info": null, "duration": 300, "image_id": null, "added": "2015-04-27T20:04:08", "slug": "9eb2e80b72ee195a", "speakers": [{"id": 15531, "name": "Mr Leslie Primo", "slug": "mr-leslie-primo"}], "topics": [{"id": 131, "name": "authors", "path": "/arts/literature/fiction/british/21stcentury/authors"}, {"id": 106, "name": "wwi", "path": "/arts/books/history/military/wwi"}, {"id": 107, "name": "wwii", "path": "/arts/books/history/military/wwii"}, {"id": 108, "name": "army", "path": "/arts/books/history/military/army"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 2725, "name": "The University Women's Club", "slug": "the-university-womens-club", "city": "London", "postcode": "W1K 1DB"}, "organizer": {"id": 2290, "name": "THE COURSE", "slug": "the-course"}, "date": "2015-11-12", "dates": [{"id": 15257, "from_date": "2015-11-12", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "10:45:00", "ticket_cost": "£49", "ticket_info": "info@thecoursestudies.co.uk", "additional_info": "visit www.thecoursestudies.co.uk", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 2725, "name": "The University Women's Club", "slug": "the-university-womens-club", "city": "London", "postcode": "W1K 1DB"}, "organizer": {"id": 2290, "name": "THE COURSE", "slug": "the-course"}}]}, {"id": 14655, "title": "The Silk Road Then and Now: Past and Present Culture", "synopsis": "The course aims to understand how and why the Silk Road trade network came into being and to explore reasons for the success and demise of its cities and traders in certain areas and eras.", "keywords": "arts, art, history, Han dynasty, Silk Road, Taklamakan and Gobi desert, ancient worlds, Arabic, Turkic, Iranian, Indian, Mongolian, Chinese, Tibetan\r\n", "body": "The Silk Road has held a fascination for travellers since the early Christian era, and many traders, religious pilgrims and conquerors have passed through the settlements and towns that stretch from Central Asia to the East China Sea. Along the various routes that make up the network of the ‘Silk Road’ - itself a misnomer - flourished an exotic mixture of cultures from Arabic, Turkic, Iranian, Indian, Mongolian, Chinese and Tibetan sources.\r\n\r\nThe richness of cultures is evident in spectacular sites ranging from abandoned cities and fortresses, Buddhist cave sites and Islamic mausoleums along the many trade routes that made the Silk Road network. The Taklamakan and Gobi desert regions yielded many artistic treasures to 19th and 20th century European archaeologists who explored - and plundered - many sites for their uniquely preserved artefacts. The research that came from these items revealed much more understanding about the relevance and significance of the Silk Road and its place in the economic history of the region.\r\n\r\nThe legacy of the Silk Road lives on through the artefacts, writings, maps and contribution of the many travellers throughout the region over many centuries.

Under New Labour, argued John O’Farrell, left-leaning comics seemed as interested in mocking Vicky Pollard-style chavs as the government. Yet Armando Ianucci’s expletive-laden The Thick of It has become part of the political lexicon while Channel 4’s 10 O’Clock Live seems to have established itself as a youthful rival to more established satirical shows. On stage, Laura Wade’s dissection of the Bullingdon Club has seen Posh join an adaptation of Yes, Minister as a theatrical hit. Meanwhile, the likes of Uncaged Monkeys have seen leading scientists, philosophers and self-proclaimed ‘geeks’ become a hit on the comedy circuit, taking pot-shots at ‘bad’ science, organised religion and other apparent symptoms of contemporary irrationalism. Comedians such as Marcus Brigstocke, Steve Coogan and Stephen Fry are regularly invited on to current affairs programmes to take a wry, sideways look at everything from climate change to press regulation. And despite the occasional backlash against their perceived smugness, they are generally taken seriously as political commentators.\r\n\r\nYet some query how far contemporary comedy lives up to satire’s unofficial slogan to ‘afflict the comfortable and comfort the afflicted’. Comedians who proudly defend their right to free speech when mocking religious fundamentalism or political correctness can simultaneously be seen demanding that others should be censored when joking about other controversial issues around disability, racism and sexual violence. There was widespread outrage when Paul Chambers was charged for joking about blowing up an airport, yet relative silence when drunk student Liam Stacey was jailed for tweeting unpleasant racist humour about Fabrice Muamba. The Thick of It and Posh are quoted and celebrated by Labour ministers in opposition: despite many being part of the same Oxbridge-educated political establishment. Similarly, whether young or old, the subjects of irreverence – greedy bankers, sleazy politicians, the folly of the public and, of course, the Daily Mail – have a depressingly familiar ring.\r\n\r\nHas satire been blunted by a conformist attitude to ‘acceptable’ speech or does it still possess a real bite? Does satire generally confirm existing prejudices or can it still shock and challenge received wisdom? Are there targets and topics which are arguably getting off lightly? How far can satire go in a society which is increasingly uncertain of who it respects and what values it shares? And having given a licence to comedians to mock more serious public figures, are we in danger of suspending our critical faculties when they hold forth?\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 120, "image_id": 1747, "added": "2012-09-13T15:57:54", "slug": "34942b8bc1aaf2d2", "speakers": [{"id": 12765, "name": "Christian  Adams", "slug": "christian-adams"}, {"id": 12766, "name": "Tim Black", "slug": "tim-black"}, {"id": 12767, "name": "Stephanie Calman", "slug": "stephanie-calman"}, {"id": 12768, "name": "Nirpal Singh Dhaliwal", "slug": "nirpal-singh-dhaliwal"}, {"id": 12769, "name": "Hugo Rifkind", "slug": "hugo-rifkind"}, {"id": 12770, "name": "Joe Wade", "slug": "joe-wade"}, {"id": 7443, "name": "David Bowden", "slug": "david-bowden"}], "topics": [{"id": 2722, "name": "politics", "path": "/academic/history/gender/politics"}, {"id": 6, "name": "arts", "path": "/arts"}, {"id": 80, "name": "society", "path": "/society"}, {"id": 61, "name": "politics", "path": "/politics"}], "supercategory": "academic", "venue": {"id": 2739, "name": "Shoreditch House", "slug": "shoreditch-house", "city": "London", "postcode": "E1 6AW"}, "organizer": {"id": 45, "name": "Institute of Ideas", "slug": "institute-of-ideas"}, "date": "2012-10-29", "dates": [{"id": 11885, "from_date": "2012-10-29", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "19:00:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": "To reserve a place contact davebowden@instituteofideas.com", "additional_info": "Visit www.battleofideas.org.uk for more information.

Deliberate fraud and sincere misinterpretation of natural events have been given as alternative explanations but recent research by psychologists and parapsychologists has indicated that a number of environmental factors appear to be associated with a tendency for susceptible individuals to report sensations typically associated with \"haunted\" locations. Factors reported to be associated with such sensations include fluctuations in the electromagnetic field and the presence of infrasound. A brief review of such work will be presented in this talk, followed by the results of the \"Haunt\" project, in which an attempt was made to construct an artificial \"haunted\" room by systematically varying such environmental factors.\r\nProfessor Chris French is the Head of the Anomalistic Psychology Research Unit in the Psychology Department at Goldsmiths, University of London. He is a Fellow of the British Psychological Society and the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry. He has published over 100 articles and chapters covering a wide range of topics within psychology. His main current area of research is the psychology of paranormal beliefs and anomalous experiences. He frequently appears on radio and television casting a sceptical eye over paranormal claims. He is the editor of The Skeptic and writes a regular column for the Guardian's online science pages.

In the 21st century men are now brought up within a value system of gender equality and gender neutrality. In consequence the accepted roles of men have changed unalterably whilst the historical underpinnings of masculinity are being fundamentally challenged. This workshop aims to explore how a perspective of evolutionary spirituality can radically reframe the archetypical male developmental journey once more into a heroic quest for meaning and the pursuit of life’s most elevated goals.\r\n\r\nMythodrama is an exciting new form of experiential learning, which in this workshop will draw on the creative forms of story and theatre to enable participants to explore the fundamental principles inherent in manhood. EnlightenNext is generating a transformative movement within consciousness and culture, empowering individuals to realize their ultimate nature and inherent unity with the 14-billion year epic of cosmic evolution.\r\n\r\nThese methods will allow participants to recontextualize the male impulses for heroism, valour and virtue, and reawaken those fundamental qualities in men that naturally aspire towards wholeness and an evolved expression of the masculine principle.\r\n\r\nBooking Details: \r\n\r\nPrice: £140, including refreshments and lunch \r\nTiming: \r\nFriday       6.30 - 9.30pm\r\nSaturday     10.00am - 6.00pm\r\nSunday       10.00am - 4.00pm\r\n\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 480, "image_id": null, "added": "2009-03-29T13:37:32", "slug": "men-and-the-quest", "speakers": [{"id": 8174, "name": "Richard Olivier", "slug": "richard-olivier"}, {"id": 3105, "name": "Mr  Chris Parish", "slug": "mr-chris-parish"}, {"id": 8175, "name": "Michael Boyle", "slug": "michael-boyle"}, {"id": 8176, "name": "Mr Linus Roache", "slug": "mr-linus-roache"}], "topics": [{"id": 1398, "name": "evolution", "path": "/academic/science/philosophy/engineering/biology/medicine/evolut"}, {"id": 1399, "name": "evolution", "path": "/academic/science/philosophy/engineering/biology/medicine/evolut"}, {"id": 1474, "name": "culture", "path": "/academic/society/culture/culture"}, {"id": 1576, "name": "development", "path": "/society/media/media/development"}], "supercategory": "academic", "venue": {"id": 809, "name": "EnlightenNext", "slug": "enlightennext", "city": "Islington", "postcode": "N1 8QG"}, "organizer": {"id": 809, "name": "EnlightenNext", "slug": "enlightennext"}, "date": "2009-06-05", "dates": [{"id": 6887, "from_date": "2009-06-05", "to_date": "2009-06-05", "time": "19:00:00", "ticket_cost": "£140", "ticket_info": "http://www.ticketweb.co.uk/user/?region=gb_london&query=detail&event=316566&interface=", "additional_info": "email:info.london@enlightennext.org\r\n020 7288 7000", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 809, "name": "EnlightenNext", "slug": "enlightennext", "city": "Islington", "postcode": "N1 8QG"}, "organizer": {"id": 809, "name": "EnlightenNext", "slug": "enlightennext"}}]}, {"id": 6512, "title": "Marie-Noelle Barton, MBE - Distinguished Lecture", "synopsis": "Marie-Noelle Barton, Former Director of WISE visits De Montfort University to give a free lecture as part of the Distinguished Lecture Series.", "keywords": "Distinguished, Lecture, Series, 2009, Marie-Noelle, Barton, De Montfort, De Montfort University, WISE, Women, Science, Engineering, Make Your Mark Campaign.", "body": "Former Director of the WISE (Women Into Science and Engineering) Campaign\r\nMarie-Noëlle is an inspirational and motivational speaker with 20 years' experience of public speaking, addressing conferences, symposia, dinners, Graduation and prize-giving events in the UK and abroad.

Do certain narrative devices undercut the justification of beliefs founded on authorial testimony? If some authors mix the ‘factual’ with the ‘fictional’, how can we be justified in believing anything they write?

This close relationship was acclaimed and exemplified by many distinguished Greek philosophers as well as physicians. Thus Aristotle, when reviewing the achievements of his predecessors on the subjects of human psychology, physiology and pathology, recognised that “the best doctors have something to say on nature ... and the more distinguished students of nature also take an interest in health and disease.” This observation was echoed five centuries later by Galen, who claimed that the best doctor is at the same time a philosopher. \r\n\r\n\r\nIn practice, Hippocrates, Galen and other medical writers used and elaborated philosophical methods and applied key concepts such as ‘Nature’ and ‘cause’ to their understanding of the workings and failings of the human body. Philosophers like Plato and Aristotle made important contributions to the study of anatomy, physiology, pathology, embryology and pharmacology, and took a great interest in medical themes such as epilepsy and melancholy, sleep and dreams, generation and sterility, and diet and drugs.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis lecture will focus on an area where the intellectual exchange between doctors and philosophers was most striking: the study of human nature, in particular the human soul in its relation to the body and to the environmental forces it is subject to. Both doctors and philosophers had important things to say on these issues, and they influenced each other in the concepts they used, the methods they employed and the views they entertained.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese themes are covered in Philip van der Eijk’s new book Medicine and Philosophy in Classical Antiquity. Doctors and Philosophers on Nature, Soul, Health and Disease, which will be published this spring by Cambridge University Press.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPhilip van der Eijk holds a PhD in Classics from Leiden University. He joined Newcastle University in 1995 to take up a Wellcome Trust University Award, and was appointed Professor of Greek in 1998. He has published widely on ancient philosophy, medicine and science, comparative literature and patristics. He is the author of a book on Aristotle’s theory of sleep and dreams (Berlin: Akademie Verlag, 1994) and of a collection of the fragments of the Greek medical writer Diocles of Carystus (2 Vols., Leiden: Brill, 2000–1). He has edited Ancient Histories of Medicine. Essays in Medical Doxography and Historiography in Classical Antiquity (Leiden: Brill, 1999) and co-edited Ancient Medicine in its Socio-Cultural Context (2 Vols., Amsterdam – Atlanta: Rodopi, 1995).\r\n\r\n\r\nHe has hosted and organised a large number of conferences, seminars and other activities in the History of Medicine at Newcastle, most noteworthy the prestigious Colloque International Hippocratique in 2002. He is one of the founders of the Centre for the History of Medicine, a partnership between Newcastle and Durham University sponsored by the Wellcome Trust.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnless otherwise noted, lectures start at 5.30, last one hour and take place in the Curtis Auditorium, Herschel Building, which sits directly across the road from Haymarket Metro Station. All lectures are free and the public are encouraged to attend. In the event of an over-capacity audience we provide audio-relay to a second lecture theatre.\r\n\r\n \r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 60, "image_id": 202, "added": "2005-03-23T11:18:41", "slug": "nature-soul-health-and-disease-greek-medical-and-philosophical-ideas-on-psychosomatic-interactio", "speakers": [{"id": 2157, "name": "Professor Philip Van-der-Eink", "slug": "professor-philip-van-der-eink"}], "topics": [{"id": 1, "name": "academic", "path": "/academic"}], "supercategory": "academic", "venue": {"id": 386, "name": "Insights - Lectures for the Public", "slug": "insights-lectures-for-the-public", "city": "Newcastle upon Tyne", "postcode": "NE1 7RU"}, "organizer": {"id": 386, "name": "Insights - Lectures for the Public", "slug": "insights-lectures-for-the-public"}, "date": "2005-04-19", "dates": [{"id": 1787, "from_date": "2005-04-19", "to_date": "2005-04-19", "time": "17:30:00", "ticket_cost": "FREE ADMISSION", "ticket_info": null, "additional_info": "The venue, Newcastle University, Curtis Auditorium is in the Herschel Building, opposite Haymarket Metro station, Newcastle upon Tyne.", "members_only": "No", "members_info": "FREE PUBLIC LECTURE EVENT", "venue": {"id": 386, "name": "Insights - Lectures for the Public", "slug": "insights-lectures-for-the-public", "city": "Newcastle upon Tyne", "postcode": "NE1 7RU"}, "organizer": {"id": 386, "name": "Insights - Lectures for the Public", "slug": "insights-lectures-for-the-public"}}]}, {"id": 1701, "title": "Manasarovar", "synopsis": "Email chat with Anup Kurian, Writer-Director of Manasarovar (India/English/90Min) - www.manasarovar.info", "keywords": "Kerala, India, Film, Movie, Dharamsala, Maharashtra, Deccan Plateau, Indian film, Watermans Center, Award winning, Monsoon Wedding, Neha Dubey, Zafar Karachiwala", "body": "Manasarovar, an award winning feature film from India is playing for a week at Watermans Center, Brentford starting March 11. \r\n\r\nThe film has won the following awards/accolades: \r\n-  Best Film and Special Jury Prize, International Film Festival of Mumbai, 2005\r\n- Fukuoka International Film Festival, Fukuoka, Japan, 2005\r\n- Official Selection - London Film Festival 2004\r\n- Opening Film, Indian Panorama, International Film Festival of India, Goa, 2004\r\n- Aravindan Puraskaram for Best Debut Director in India\r\n- Gollapudi Srinivas National Award for Best Debut Director in India\r\n\r\nA real low cost venture made on a camera bought from EBAY which was later sold to buy monitors from EBAY for post-production, Manasarovar was described by a critic as a \"love story that ends before it begins\". \r\n\r\nShot in 30 locations spread throughout India, Manasarovar takes you across the length and breadth of the Indian sub-continent - the rugged landscapes of Deccan Plateau, the greenery of Kerala and serenity of Dharamsala.\r\n\r\nStarring twice National Award winning actor Atul Kulkarni and Neha Dubey (Monsoon Wedding), Manasarovar is about coincidences that hurt people.", "additional_info": null, "duration": 480, "image_id": 331, "added": "2005-03-10T20:44:10", "slug": "1f0cd05d7136604d", "speakers": [], "topics": [], "supercategory": "academic", "venue": null, "organizer": null, "date": null, "dates": []}, {"id": 1688, "title": "Cybersalon: Cybersonica Festival", "synopsis": "Cybersonica explores the latest in electronic music, sonic arts and audiovisual culture through a two-day symposium, an exhibition of sound toys and sonic art works and two evenings of live audiovisual performance.\r\n\r\nCelebrating sonic innovation, Cybersonica is a leading event for anyone interested in how technology shapes the way musicians, sound artists and audiovisualisers make and present their work.
