Eleven of them, including General Secretary Rudolf Slánský, were hanged. This biggest and most antisemitically charged show trial in the Eastern bloc can be seen as a consequence of the Soviet geopolitical turn in the Middle East – away from Israel towards the Arab countries. It was also a consequence of the pursuit of ethnic homogeneity within the CCP. What can be observed here is a resurfacing of the ethnic conflicts of the interwar period, albeit under different terms.\r\n \r\nJan Gerber is head of the research unit ‘Politics’ and of the research group ‘A new History of the Labour Movement’ at the Simon Dubnow Institute for Jewish History and Culture.

Soon Annie is drawn unwillingly into the art world, where she’s pursued by a host of characters that would do anything to possess her picture, from an exiled Russian oligarch, to an avaricious Sheika, a desperate auctioneer and an unscrupulous art dealer. \r\n\r\nTogether, Hannah and Rachel will discuss the inspiration behind the novel – from the London art world, to the darker secrets of European art history and beyond.\r\n\r\n ‘The Improbability of Love is a romp, a joy, and an inspired feast of clever delights.

So: you are an analytic philosopher if you think Kripke writes clearly; you are a continental philosopher if you think Heidegger writes clearly.” Does it matter how a philosopher writes? Can we “translate” a thinker whose style is difficult into clearer terms, as we could with a scientist? Do some philosophers simply write obscurely because they have nothing substantial to say, as has been said many times of Derrida? Or is the style inseparable from the thought, a part of the journey we must go on if we claim to understand it?

In this lecture Professor David Wilson examines the costs and benefits of the advent of local governance and the implications for effective policy making.

He was until recently President of The Royal Society (2000-2005), and before that Chief Scientific Adviser to the UK Government and Head of the UK Office of Science and Technology (1995-2000).  His career includes a Personal Chair in Physics at Sydney University aged 33, Class of 1877 Professor of Zoology and Chairman of the Research Board at Princeton, and in 1988 a move to Britain as Royal Society Research Professor.  Particular interests include how populations are structured and respond to change, particularly with respect to infectious diseases and biodiversity.  He was awarded a Knighthood in 1996, and appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia in 1998, both for “Services to Science”.  In 2001 he was one of the first 15 Life Peers created by the “House of Lords Appointments Commission”.  In 2002, The Queen appointed him to the Order of Merit (the fifth Australian in its 100-year history).

Three studies will be discussed. In the first, participants were given false memories for a positive event to see whether these memories, like true memories, might have repercussions. The second study was designed to assess whether demand characteristics could explain the results of false memory studies. In the final study, some participants were given false memories for three different emotional childhood events. Other participants had pre-existing (presumably true) memories for the same three events. The emotionality of the true and false memories was then compared, to see whether emotional content might be a reliable signal of memory accuracy.\r\n\r\nBiography \r\nDr Cara Laney is a lecturer of forensic psychology at the University of Leicester. She completed her PhD at the University of California in 2006, working with Elizabeth Loftus. Her main area of research is human memory and the myriad ways it can go wrong.

Gordon Brown and Barack Obama may not be there, but the opinion formers of tomorrow will be. Will you?\r\n\r\nNow the dust has settled on the G20 London Summit, the economic reality remains: bankruptcies and unemployment are set to rise to the highest levels since the Great Depression. For all the talk about international co-operation, upbeat predictions about improving financial systems, and open markets versus protectionist measures, the recession still digs deep, and solutions are still contested, indeed contradictory.\r\n\r\nToo often such disputes, whether about regulation, liquidity or state bail-outs, are reduced to technical discussions, confined to world leaders and financial gurus. While the G20 as an event attracted maximum media attention, its debates and conclusions too frequently felt like communiqués from above, with the world’s citizens reduced to spectators on the sidelines.\r\n\r\nThe recession has enormous political and social ramifications for all of us. It needs to become a focus of public discussion, but popular involvement seems confined instead to lacklustre demonstrations or lobbing insults, sometimes bricks, at bankers, financial institutions and even economic growth itself. In contrast, this is a public summit that means business – a public discussion with leading political and economic thinkers.\r\n\r\nSessions include:\r\n\r\n• Demystifying the crisis; recession in the heart of the Eurozone \r\n• Rein in the greedy bankers? \r\n• Alternative activists’ working lunch \r\n• Can the state save the economy? \r\n• Protectionism, global tensions and a new world order? \r\n• The rise and rise of behavioural economics \r\n• Investing in the future – what could be the new engine of growth for the UK?\r\n\r\nConfirmed speakers include: \r\n\r\n\r\nParminder Bahra, poverty and development correspondent, The Times; Claire Fox, director, Institute of Ideas; Frank Furedi, professor of sociology, University of Kent, Canterbury; author, Politics of Fear, John Hilary, Executive Director, War on Want;  Rob Killick, CEO, cScape; author, UK after the recession; Nick Kochan, financial journalist and economic analyst; co-author  What Happened?: And Other Questions Everyone Is Asking About the Credit Crunch; Deepak Lal, James S.

If religious fundamentalists had their way, Darwinian theory would (at best) be taught as one theory among many with no greater claim to rational assent than the theory that God created the universe essentially as it now is in roughly 4004BC. More sophisticated thinkers hold that such direct clashes between science and religion are quite unnecessary: that one can be a religious believer without coming into the slightest conflict with science. John Worrall examines various ways in which this compatibility view has been defended. This examination shows that while religion and science can indeed avoid direct conflict, there is ineliminable conflict between religion and the general scientific approach – an approach based on the axiom that it is reasonable to believe only what evidence gives you reason to believe.

While the latest independent report indicates that the Taliban have significantly increased their political and military control to around 75% of the country, and shows that 2008 has been the deadliest for US troops since the 2001 invasion, President-elect Obama has pledged to make the fight against the Taliban and Al-Qaeda his top priority. He'll be sending more troops to the region, has proposed an additional $1 billion in non-military assistance each year, and seems committed to preventing corruption.\r\n\r\nBut will these additional resources and commitment from the US government be enough to reverse this war and beat the Taliban? Is it realistic to think that the corruption so endemic to the country, can ever be significantly reduced or wiped out? How important are Pakistani policies and their alliances to British and US governments to this war? And given that more than two-thirds of Britons think that UK troops should leave Afghanistan within a year, will lack of popular support for this war impact on British government policy out there?\r\n\r\nJames Appathurai is a spokesperson for NATO\r\n\r\nCol Stuart Tootal was a Commander of 3 Para Battle Group in Afghanistan before resigning from the army at the end of 2007 following his promotion to Colonel.

This included commanding the first UK Battle Group of 1200 soldiers to be sent to Helmand Province in Southern Afghanistan in 2006, for which he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order. On returning to the UK, he set up the 3 PARA Afghan Trust charity. \r\n\r\nChristina Lamb has been a foreign correspondent for almost 20 years, living in Pakistan, Brazil and South Africa first for the Financial Times then the Sunday Times.

Were the American moon landings all a hoax?  Mainstream accounts of significant world events are typically accepted as the truth, but alternative accounts for such events often fall under the banner of the popular term conspiracy theories.  A conspiracy theory is defined as an attempt to explain the ultimate cause of a significant political or social event as a secret plot by a covert alliance of powerful individuals or organizations, rather than as an overt activity, accident, or natural occurrence.  Although some conspiracy theories have ultimately been shown to be true, most conspiracy theories remain as unproven and rather implausible alternative explanations to the mainstream account of events.  Nonetheless, conspiracy theories are popular and, in her research, Dr Karen Douglas has attempted to understand why this is the case.  In this talk, she will present research examining the extent to which conspiracy theories influence people’s attitudes about significant world events.  She will also present work examining the individual differences correlates of conspiracy beliefs.  Finally, she will propose a theory to explain why conspiracy theories are appealing to so many people.  \r\n\r\nBiography\r\nKaren Douglas was awarded her PhD in social psychology from the Australian National University in 2000.  She is currently a Senior Lecturer in Psychology at the University of Kent.

This inventor, scientist, diplomat and politician had a vivid spiritual life in which he actually saw and spoke to angels, spirits and demons, and voyaged spiritually to heaven and to hell -- almost daily, with shocking vividness, he said. A Christian, Swedemborg believed that the Bible's message was about how a person could evolve from a materialistic to a spiritual being; for example Genesis was, for him, not an account of the creation of Earth, but an account of man's rebirth in six steps. For all his Christian devotion, though, he wrote in sexually explicit terms at times, enough to shock. But love, he stressed, was the root of all. From this is his early form of a 'polarity' ideal - the union of man and woman, was, to his mind a perfect mirroring of the divine. Swedenborg was profoundly influential upon later esotericists and literary figures, including William Blake and Madame Blavatsky, so his ideas survived even if his fame did not. Richard Lines will talk about Swedenborg's achievements and about his surprisingly widespread influence. This talk is ideal for people interested in angelic communications, historians of spiritual ideas, and everyone who appreciates a mystical traveller across the spiritual planes.\r\n\r\nRichard Lines is Secretary of the Swedenborg Society in Bloomsbury.
