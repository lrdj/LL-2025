Some of these women assisted in the human experiments that took place at the camp, administered lethal injections to prisoners, and deliberately withheld medication. But who were these women, and how did they end up working at a concentration camp?\r\n\r\nThe backgrounds of these female medical personnel, their paths to Ravensbrück, and their experiences as workers in the camp hospital, known as the Revier, varied quite substantially between individuals. However, what unites their journeys is that all were impacted by contemporary constructs of gender while they worked in the Revier; namely, these women experienced at least some level of subordination to their male counterparts. Yet this differed significantly between individuals, and, on an individualistic basis, over time. But we must move beyond the tropes of subordination/domination entirely in order to obtain a more nuanced understanding of the interactions between the medical staff in the Revier, especially given that individual women and men did not always perceive these themes as particularly prominent in their testimonies after the war. Other notable tropes, apart from subordination/domination, were evident in their recollections, such as differing medical ideologies and romantic love.\r\n\r\nThis argument will be formulated through engagement with a variety of sources, including survivor testimony, documents from the post-war Ravensbrück and Nuremberg Trials, and oral history. Analysing the Revier through the lens of gender not only allows us to obtain a wider knowledge of who participated in Nazi crimes, but also enables the gleaning of similarities between certain gender constructs in concentration camps and in wider society.", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": null, "added": "2018-08-15T22:51:13", "slug": "759861f76034c2b8", "speakers": [{"id": 16845, "name": "Kate Docking", "slug": "kate-docking"}], "topics": [{"id": 107, "name": "wwii", "path": "/arts/books/history/military/wwii"}, {"id": 2692, "name": "history", "path": "/arts/finearts/film/film/history"}, {"id": 106, "name": "wwi", "path": "/arts/books/history/military/wwi"}, {"id": 108, "name": "army", "path": "/arts/books/history/military/army"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 1886, "name": "The Wiener Library for the Study of the Holocaust and Genocide", "slug": "the-wiener-library-for-the-study-of-the-holocaust-and-genocide", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC1B 5DP"}, "organizer": {"id": 1886, "name": "The Wiener Library for the Study of the Holocaust and Genocide", "slug": "the-wiener-library-for-the-study-of-the-holocaust-and-genocide"}, "date": "2018-10-16", "dates": [{"id": 16797, "from_date": "2018-10-16", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "14:00:00", "ticket_cost": "Free, registration essential", "ticket_info": "https://www.wienerlibrary.co.uk/Whats-On?item=413", "additional_info": "An accessible toilet is available in the basement and can be reached via the lift.\r\nFor visitors with hearing impairment, an induction loop in the exhibition area and the Wolfson Reading Room is compatible with T-coil equipped hearing aids.\r\nWe welcome Guide and Assistance dogs in the exhibition area and the Wolfson Reading Room.\r\nIf you have any comments, questions, or concerns regarding accessibility at the Library, please email us at info@wienerlibrary.co.uk or call us at +44 (0) 20 7636 7247.", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 1886, "name": "The Wiener Library for the Study of the Holocaust and Genocide", "slug": "the-wiener-library-for-the-study-of-the-holocaust-and-genocide", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC1B 5DP"}, "organizer": {"id": 1886, "name": "The Wiener Library for the Study of the Holocaust and Genocide", "slug": "the-wiener-library-for-the-study-of-the-holocaust-and-genocide"}}]}, {"id": 16124, "title": "The Battle of Dettingen, 1743", "synopsis": "Marking the 275th anniversary of the Battle of Dettingen, Sophie Stathi of the National Army Museum discusses the battle’s significance.

Mouradian discusses how, and why, a series of fateful decisions affecting hundreds of thousands of Armenian deportees, rolled out beginning in fall 1915, culminated in a second wave of massacres in the Syrian desert in summer 1916, and how thousands of Armenians survived the carnage through the efforts of the humanitarian resistance network.\r\n\r\nKhatchig Mouradian is the Henry S.

This stance included opposition to the teaching of the Holocaust in schools or colleges and to the establishment of Holocaust museums and monuments. In particular, the government of Helmut Kohl considered the afterlife of the Holocaust in America a serious threat to (West) Germany’s reputation. German officials feared that a preoccupation with the history of the Holocaust, as told from the perspective of its victims, may even cause Americans to question the alliance with the Federal Republic. Therefore, representatives of the German government tried for more than a decade to change the way the history of the Holocaust was told and taught in the United States.  \r\n\r\nYet Germany realized at some point that all efforts to change the debate about the Holocaust abroad, such as its attempts to interfere with the planning of the US Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C., were doomed to fail. Germany thus completely reversed its strategy and opted to fully embrace the Holocaust and its legacies. Indeed, Germany’s political leadership realized that Holocaust memory did not necessarily have to weaken the country’s international reputation, but rather that an open, unapologetic engagement bore the potential to strengthen it.

The history is an amalgam of airframe & engine development, with enormous technical problems being overcome in both, chronologically-adjacent to personal experience reports of aircrew in action. The front line Manchester era began in November 1940, ending 20 months later in June 1942. From the lowest point in both Bomber Command & Manchester fortunes in August 1941, with the shocking Butt Report, the aircraft just hung on to participate in the earliest 1000 bomber raids, after which Manchesters were relegated to training. Eventually 202 Manchesters, using 538 Vultures, managed 1250 sorties with seven RAF Squadrons. The key to the entire story is the temperamental Vulture engine, without a proper account of which history could not have been written. This was input by the Rolls-Royce Heritage Trust.

This wide-ranging and thought-provoking lecture will examine the complex reasons for this phenomenon, and in so doing also grapple with the important issues of freedom of expression, blasphemy, censorship and taboo. As will become evident, sex, religion, politics, morality and money – either by themselves, or in combination - lie at the heart of most of these controversies – as does the power of modern art to challenge and subvert the social and aesthetic status quo. This is the final NADFAS at Night event in 2015 at our secret location in the heart of Covent Garden.

HYSTERIA is a feminist periodical and a platform for activism, politics and solidarity. The periodical strives to expose power relations that have become naturalised and entrenched through illusions of equality. It believes that feminism is a universal concern and not reserved for a selected few. It should be spread across discussions between all walks of life. \r\n\r\nTherefore, HYSTERIA harbours multiple streams of feminisms. This is a direct outcome of the webs of distinct and overlapping feminist narratives of struggles and oppression. It insists on the equality of all, through a continuous discussion on what equality entails, refusing to settle on a rigid definition. HYSTERIA starkly opposes ideologies, philosophies, and belief-systems that have generated the fantasy of feminism as a property, commodity or craze and believes that these ideas reproduce merginalisation, deprivation and inequity.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTRIBUTORS\r\n Bjørk Grue Lidin | Awa Konate | Nakeya B. | Christina Cooke | Elssie Ansareo | Mathias Klitgaard Sørensen | Jago Rackham | The Guerrilla Girls | Alx | Marie Hugo | Katrya | Henri Maccheroni | Caconrad | Gabriella Daris | Yoko Ono | Amy King | Rawan Al Ramahi | Hannah Hoch | Dr. Rebecca Steinfeld | Tove Lyssarides | Steven C.

Kantor interviewed the Obamas together in the Oval Office and is the only author to be granted access to Michelle Obama's East Wing. Filled with detail and insight into their partnership and personalities, The Obamas: A Mission, A Marriage reveals the hidden aspects of their time in the White House. With a keen eye for the ironies of public life and the realities of power, Kantor brings into sharp focus the question that underpins the Obamas' marriage: can politics achieve real change in society? \r\n\r\nJodi Kantor began her journalism career by dropping out of Harvard Law School to join Slate.com in 1998. Four years later, she became the youngest section editor of The New York Times, taking over and revamping the Arts & Leisure section. She began covering the Obamas for the paper in 2007, writing front-page stories that chronicled their biographies and philosophies, and also writing about Hillary Clinton, Sarah Palin and other major political figures along the way.

It is the fundamental aspect of any assessment and assessment developers must show that what is measured in a test or exam bears a valid relation to the desired knowledge and skills in the real world.

Traditionally, examinations in the UK have relied on a close link with teaching and learning communities (of vocational or subject specialists) to underpin the validity of their assessments. How can we ensure the value of assessment results by reaffirming this traditional system? Is the gathering of ‘validity evidence’ and validation by assessment experts the way to do this?\r\n\r\nThis seminar is part of the Assessment Principles series of seminars presented by Andrew Watts, a Principal Consultant for the Cambridge Assessment Network Division. The series focuses on five key topics in assessment: the purposes of assessment; the relationship between assessment and learning; the development of assessments; the validity and the reliability of assessments. Each session addresses one of these topics. Though the topics are the same each year, up-to-date issues are discussed which focus on recent news stories or which represent the latest thinking in that area. The series is for those who want to take a broad view of the field of educational assessment, in company with others working in the field. Participants will be able to share their own experiences and perceptions, and to reflect on those of others. A certificate is awarded for attendance at all five sessions (contact the Network team for details).\r\n\r\nDates for 2012 are:\r\n\r\n8 March: What is the purpose of public assessments (Cambridge)\r\n12 April: What is the purpose of public assessments (Coventry)\r\n10 May: How can assessment support learning?

It was commissioned by Art on the Underground as the first of a series of projects on the Central line for 2011.\r\n\r\nMichael Landy grew up in East London where he still lives. Throughout his life most of his journeys have started out on the Central line. Landy studied art at Loughton, Loughborough and Goldsmiths colleges. Shortly afterwards he achieved acclaim as one of the Young British Artists who transformed the international art scene in the early 1990s.\r\n\r\nLandy’s major projects include Break Down (Artangel, 2001), where he destroyed all his material possessions. The experience led him to reflect deeply on the value of the small acts of compassion that connect us with others, triggering his idea for Acts of Kindness. His other projects include Semi-Detached (2004), for which he reproduced his parents’ house to scale inside the galleries of Tate Britain, and Art Bin (2010) at the South London Gallery where he invited artists to come and throw away their work.\r\n\r\nLandy is currently Associate Artist at the National Gallery. In recognition of his major contribution to contemporary art, he was made a lifetime member of the Royal Academy of Arts in 2008.\r\n\r\nMark Vernon is a writer whose work primarily pursues the ancient philosophers’ great question: how to live. He is the author of The Meaning of Friendship and How to be an Agnostic, and edits two Acumen book series on The Art of Living and Heretics.

This lecture will trace Martin’s personal journey with both the science and art of holography detailing some of the highlights on the way.\r\n\r\nProfessor Richardson achieved the world’s first PhD in display holography from the Royal College of Art, London, and has been awarded The Millennium Fellowship by the UK Millennium government commission.

His second book ‘The Prime Illusion: Holography In The New Age Of Digital Media’ has now been translated into Chinese by the University of Beijing Press, China to be published later this year.

However, in 1956 Benjamin Lee Whorf made the then radical suggestion that our language may actually shape our thoughts and perceptions of the world.  This came to be known as the linguistic relativity or Sapir-Whorf hypothesis.  One prediction of this hypothesis would be that the speakers of different languages might actually perceive the world differently.  A popular example of this is the supposed extensive vocabulary the Inuit people have to name and perceive many more types of snow than speakers of other languages.  Although this example has now been discredited, a substantial body of work on colour language and perception does support the notion that speakers of languages that have different colour vocabularies actually perceive colour somewhat differently.  For instance, Dr Sowden's research found that Setswana speaking members of the Bangwaketse tribe from Botswana, who do not have separate colour terms for blue and green, perceived these colours as more similar than an English speaking population.

He will also present an IT- (“Interaction through Textures”) framework for interactive architecture built on the notion of the interaction society, built environments as communicated persistent structures, and ephemeral interaction, graceful interaction, and interaction landscaping – important human elements for understanding interaction through interactive architecture.\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 60, "image_id": 662, "added": "2008-02-06T13:27:00", "slug": "992f6b26a2bd1e5b", "speakers": [{"id": 6492, "name": "Dr. Mikael Wiberg", "slug": "dr-mikael-wiberg"}], "topics": [{"id": 623, "name": "interaction", "path": "/arts/science/interaction"}, {"id": 441, "name": "computerscience", "path": "/academic/computerscience"}, {"id": 672, "name": "media", "path": "/academic/media"}, {"id": 190, "name": "architecture", "path": "/arts/architecture"}, {"id": 1171, "name": "informationdesign", "path": "/arts/design/informationdesign"}, {"id": 114, "name": "interactivesculpture", "path": "/arts/interactivesculpture"}, {"id": 442, "name": "computing", "path": "/society/computing"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 1178, "name": "Lansdown Centre for Electronic Arts", "slug": "lansdown-centre-for-electronic-arts", "city": "Barnet", "postcode": "EN4 8HT"}, "organizer": {"id": 1178, "name": "Lansdown Centre for Electronic Arts", "slug": "lansdown-centre-for-electronic-arts"}, "date": "2008-02-20", "dates": [{"id": 5386, "from_date": "2008-02-20", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "16:45:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": null, "additional_info": "If you easily can, please email Stephen Boyd Davis: s.boyd-davis@mdx.ac.uk if you plan to come.

With the majority of university students actively maintaining profiles, educationalists are currently exploring the potential of Facebook as an educational application. Growing numbers of educators are celebrating the potential of Facebook to (re)engage students with their studies, whilst other commentators fear that Facebook compromises students’ engagement with traditional university education.\r\n\r\nAgainst this background, there are a number of questions which need to be asked of the prominence of Facebook within the contemporary higher education environment. Based on an in-depth qualitative analysis of the Facebook activity of 909 undergraduate students in a UK university this presentation investigates the realities of students’ Facebook use – not least how any instances of education- related engagement are being played out. Analysis of these data show how much of students’ ‘educational’ use of Facebook was based around either the post-hoc critiquing of learning experiences and events; the exchange of logistical or factual information about teaching and assessment requirements; instances of supplication and moral support with regards to assessment or learning; and the promotion of oneself as academically incompetent and/or disengaged.\r\n\r\nWith these themes in mind, the presentation contends that Facebook has been fast established as a prominent arena where students can become versed in the ‘identity politics’ (and in Erving Goffman’s term ‘facework’) of being a student. Thus rather than necessarily enhancing or eroding students’ ‘front-stage’ engagement with their formal studies, Facebook provides a ready space where the ‘role conflict’ that students often experience in their relationships with university work, teaching staff, academic conventions and expectations can be worked through in a relatively closed ‘backstage’ area.\r\n\r\nNeil Selwyn is a senior lecturer at the London Knowledge Lab where his research focuses on information technology and society. The two over-riding themes throughout his work are the place of technology in everyday life and the sociology of educational technology.
