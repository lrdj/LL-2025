The Prince’s family scoffed at Rosemary’s chequered family pedigree and dismissed the love-weary Prince’s designs, leaving Rosemary, a heroic Red Cross nurse during the Great War, to be swept into marriage by Eric, Viscount Ednam, a close friend of Edward, and heir to an ancient English Earldom. The Ednams became a dynamic couple of the Bright Young Things era of the 1920s, but in July, 1930 at the peak of their chaotic life together, Rosemary met her sudden death in a horrific aeroplane crash, which also killed three of her fellow aristocrats. The unexplained accident (which remains unsolved even today) caused giant ripples across the whole of British Society. Rumours were rife of sabotage, especially as it was said that Edward, Prince of Wales, had only just escaped death in the same crash by changing his travel plans at the last minute. Will Cross (author of several biographies on the British gentry) unravels Rosemary’s life and times and offers some startling and sinister facts about the aftermath of her tragic death.

We invite one of the central figures of our times to nominate a personal hero from a different field – a cultural icon whose work they have long admired from afar. Then we bring the pair together on stage for a unique and rich conversation.\r\n\r\nOliver Jeffers’ work is celebrated for the way his illustrations and stories conjure a sense of magic and curiosity. From books about a boy helping a lost penguin (Lost and Found) to his laugh-out-loud classic (Stuck), he brings a sense of wonder and possibility into the lives of his many young readers. But his latest challenge has come – not in imagining something fantastic and wonderful – but in trying to explain the world, in its simplest terms, to his two-year-old son. Here We Are tries to look at the planet through fresh eyes and explain the complexity of humanity without losing the enchantment of a child’s perspective.\r\n\r\nPhysicist and popular television presenter Brian Cox is no stranger to this same task. In his informative science programmes, he has managed to explain complicated ideas using relatable metaphors and simple language. Joining up the unseen principles that inform everything which happens on Earth and making them understandable and exciting for adults and children alike. He often reminds his audience that Physics has dated the universe at over thirteen billion years in age, and – from that perspective – our time on Earth is both exceedingly small and extremely precious. It’s a challenging idea to impart to a young person, but an important one all the same.\r\n\r\nOliver has invited Brian to join him on stage so that they can discuss what it means to see the bigger picture: in Physics and in fiction. As a father, he is concerned with how we live on the Earth, the message that we offer to our children and how we can help future generations understand that everything we do in our shared world will impact others.

In this talk I explore the relationships between the storyworld, the narration, and the real reader. In particular, I look at the ways in which the deictic language of the text evokes a sense of involvement in the narrative discourse and immersion in the storyworld. Using deictic shift theory (Duchan, Bruder and Hewitt 1995; Herman 2002), I explore the deictic projection, into and out of narratorial and narratee roles, invited by the person, spatial, temporal, social and discourse deixis of the opening few pages, conceptually drawing the reader into the fantasy spaces of both the scene of the telling and the scene of the told. This paper will offer an alternative model to text world theory, a different but connected and complementary account of readers 'experiences of processing and navigation across story worlds . . .\r\n\r\n'\"As if stepping into a movie\": A text world theory account of Neil Gaiman's <i>The Graveyard Book</i>'\r\n\r\nMarcello Giovanelli (University of Nottingham)&#8232;&#8232;\r\n\r\n! /assets/images/2256.jpg!\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I outline the operational parameters and analytical potential of text world theory (Gavins 2007; Werth 1999). I argue that text world theory is particularly useful in explaining both the texture and the likely interpretative effects of narratives that rely on a variety of temporal, spatial and perspectival shifts. I subsequently use text world theory to analyse the opening to Neil Gaiman's The Graveyard Book, drawing on and explaining more impressionistic responses from both the literary-critical tradition and from online book reviews that emphasise readerly feelings of disorientation and fear. In doing so, I hope to show that text world theory, as part of a systematic and rigorous stylistics, can help to account for existing readings of texts and also generate insights in new and interesting ways.\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 2057, "added": "2015-03-09T13:30:34", "slug": "steps-in-stylistics", "speakers": [{"id": 15421, "name": "Dr Andrea Macrae", "slug": "dr-andrea-macrae"}, {"id": 15422, "name": "Dr Marcello Giovanelli", "slug": "dr-marcello-giovanelli"}], "topics": [{"id": 1539, "name": "stylistics", "path": "/academic/arts/linguistics/stylistics"}, {"id": 3816, "name": "narrative", "path": "/arts/language/narrative"}], "supercategory": "academic", "venue": {"id": 928, "name": "English, Middlesex University", "slug": "english-middlesex-university", "city": "London", "postcode": "NW4 4BT"}, "organizer": {"id": 928, "name": "English, Middlesex University", "slug": "english-middlesex-university"}, "date": "2015-03-10", "dates": [{"id": 15078, "from_date": "2015-03-10", "to_date": "2015-03-10", "time": "13:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": null, "additional_info": "All welcome.

It is the incredible journey of an awkward, terrified young typist in her twenties later chosen to become one of the President's most loyal and devoted servants, spending most of her adult working life travelling with, supporting and caring for the man she would come to call 'Khulu', or 'grandfather'. \r\n\r\nZelda la Grange was born in 1970 and brought up in apartheid South Africa. She began working as a secretary for the government in 1992, in the Department of State Expenditure. In 1993 she moved to the Human Resources division and in 1994 she joined the office of the first democratically elected President of South Africa as a senior ministerial typist. She was promoted to one of President Mandela's three private secretaries in 1997 and in 1999 Nelson Mandela requested her to remain in his services beyond retirement.

Our guests will be discussing the vital influence and importance of nonviolent techniques in civil movements across the globe, and introducing the book.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the foreword by Paul Rogers:\r\n\r\n “If we talk about 'people power' or 'nonviolent action', most people will immediately think of Gandhi or Martin Luther King, a few will recall the end of the Marcos regime in the Philippines in the mid-1980s, and some others will remember or have heard of the Prague Spring nearly two decades earlier. Moreover, for most activists and others involved in peace action and movements for social change, there will be little knowledge of the theories of nonviolent action and still less of the huge number of actions taken in so many countries and in such different circumstances across the world. Even recent events across the Middle East are rarely put in a broader historical context. The book is subtitled A Bibliography of People Power and Nonviolent Protest, but it is much more than this. Although the focus is on post-1945 movements, the opening section provides a wide-ranging introduction to the history and theoretical bases of nonviolent action, as well as reflecting the most recent contributions to the literature and citing key reference works and internet sites. All the main sources have accounts of their content and relevance, frequently managing to get to the core of the books or articles in just a couple of sentences. \r\n\r\nWhat really comes across is the sheer range of examples contained within this bibliography. It is extraordinarily impressive, taking us through the campaigns in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union at the end of the Cold War, the earlier actions in late colonial Africa, campaigns of nonviolent resistance in Latin America and the Middle East and the growing number of 'electoral revolutions' since 2000, especially in post Soviet states and Africa, and the burgeoning resistance to repression in various forms.”\r\n\r\nAbout the editors\r\n\r\nApril Carter: Involved in the peace and nonviolent movement since the late 1950s, former Secretary of the Direct Action Committee Against Nuclear War, 1958-61, Assistant Editor of Peace News, 1961-62, member of the Alternative Defence Commission, 1980-1988.

In the first decade of the 21st century, China has further elevated itself to an upper-middle-income country. Based on these achievements, the country sets its new goals for economic development: a sustainable economic growth to double its scale, a high-income economy with a higher per capita GDP, a transformation in the economic structure and an overall modernisation.\r\n\r\nNew Changes in China’s Economic Development\r\n\r\n1. The costs for different production (supply) factors has increased significantly, which means China can no longer depend on its low costs to compete in the international arena. Therefore, it is necessary to transform its development pattern, from its dependence on the expansion of investment in production factors to an economic growth powered by efficiency (including both factor efficiency and total factor productivity).\r\n\r\n2. The major threat against a balanced economic development turns from increased demand to demand deficiencies, which mainly manifests in three aspects: a deficiency in investment, a deficiency in consumption and a decreasing boost from export demand to the economic growth which relies more and more on domestic consumption.\r\n\r\nNew Features in China’s Unbalanced Economics\r\n\r\nSince China took its baby-steps toward an upper-middle-income economy in 2010 at a time when the government began to retreat from its growth-stimulating policies against the 2008 financial crisis, new features of China’s economic imbalance have emerged. The country now faces two risks: great pressure from inflation and a lack of demand to drive up the economy.\r\n\r\nNew Directions for China’s Economic Growth\r\n\r\nAdjustments in macro-economic policies can help to alleviate the short-term disequilibrium. However, the major threat of China's short-term disequilibrium and long-term unsustainable development stems from the structural conflicts in the economy. Therefore, in order to alleviate and efficiently control these conflicts, and to bridge the “middle-income gap”, China needs to transform its development pattern. Its main approach is to make a strategic adjustment in the economic structure and to encourage innovation in technology and policies, which also serves as the drive for the adjustment. Only by deepening reform can innovation in policy-making be achieved; only by innovation in policy-making can technological innovation be pushed forward. With innovations in these fields, a further upgraded economic structure and a strategic adjustment to transform the development pattern can be achieved, which will ultimately bring about the new historical transcendence of China’s economy and its sustainable development.\r\n\r\nProfessor Liu Wei is executive vice president of Peking University in charge of humanities and social sciences, continuous education, sports and technology transfer at the university.\r\n\r\nHe got his bachelor, master and Ph.D. degrees in economics at Peking University.  Before the current position, he served as dean of School of Economics, assistant president and vice president of Peking University.

He was always fairly good at drawing, so his parents packed him off to an art school in London to learn a trade. Three years on he put his graphic design training to good use by getting a job in advertising. As a writer. Which he did for a long, long time.  Then one day he asked his wife what she thought about the idea of a novel written entirely in emails. And so began his second writing career. He is the author of several books including E and E Squared. Apart from that, he doesn't do anything very useful, he smokes too much and he listens to music all the time. Even in his sleep most likely. \r\n\r\nSarah Salway has written three novels and two books of short stories. Her latest novel, Getting the Picture, was published last year by Ballantine in the US. She writes regularly for Psychologies Magazine in the UK, and her poems have been published widely including in the Financial Times, Pen International and the Virago Book of Shopping. Neil Gaiman describes Sarah as 'the Madonna of writing books'. \r\n\r\nRead International is a charity that supports the empowerment of people and communities through education in Tanzania and Uganda by collecting books and money for under resourced class rooms.

Examples include bearings where surfaces slide, catalysts that interact with chemicals, solar arrays that convert light into electricity, and fluid-dynamical surfaces such as turbines and propellers. \r\n\r\nIn this lecture Professor Walker will consider some of the relevant properties of surfaces and contrast how the form and texture of surfaces can be controlled by craft processes on one side, and by modern computer-controlled manufacturing techniques on the other. He will examine the Precessions process (developed by UK spin-out company Zeeko Ltd) from the perspective of polishing complex surfaces where traditional methods fail.  This has particular applications for polishing of prosthetic joint implants, which provides a real example of where automated methods are displacing craft processes, resulting in improved lifetimes in the human body. \r\n\r\nAt the other extreme lie surfaces that combine large sizes up to a metre or more, with the finest control – even down to near-atomic dimensions. This is the case with large optical surfaces – and in particular, mirrors for astronomy, remote-sensing from space, and high-power lasers. The lecture will also look at the international project to build the world’s largest optical telescopes – the 42-meter European Extremely Large Telescope, the greatest challenge of which is the manufacturing of the 1,148 mirror segments, each some 1.4m across.

In the Western world today we see it as a senseless ball of fire, giving more thought to sunglass styles than to the nature of the Sun itself.  We are even taught to fear it, though nothing could be more important to us and planet Earth. It was not the application of science that branded belief in a living Sun as primitive and ignorant – it was the triumph of the prophet-driven religions that controlled our schools and universities for centuries. \r\n\r\nIn the light of solar science, ancient (and \r\nnot so ancient) cultures appear to have been correct: a living Sun makes more sense than a ‘hot rock’. Recognition of stellar consciousness is THE big missing piece in the jigsaw puzzle of our cosmos. From the logical exploration of this realization it becomes apparent that consciousness pervades the entire cosmos, and that our Universe is a bottom up construction that is filled with intelligence and design, yet in no need of an Intelligent Designer. \r\n\r\nTonight we will be taking the lid off the longest running cover-up in history and bringing the Sun back in from the cold. The implications are stunning!\r\n\t\r\nGregory Sams has been bringing novel concepts to the culture from the age of 19, when he and his brother Craig opened the historic Seed Restaurant in 1968 London. Within a few years his Harmony/Whole Earth Foods was the country’s first and foremost source of natural and organic foods. In 1982 he created and christened the original VegeBurger, then in 1988 moved from food to fractals, opening a shop dedicated to the new “chaos theory,” publishing and licensing fractal art worldwide. This led to his first book Uncommon Sense: The State is Out of Date, exploring the lesson of chaos theory for humanity. His new book Sun of gOd, has just been published by Weiser Books, in which, as he puts it, the biggest elephant-in-the-room that you could ever imagine is unveiled.\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 150, "image_id": 1326, "added": "2010-02-01T19:03:00", "slug": "7b560bf8a74172e5", "speakers": [{"id": 9347, "name": "Greg Sams", "slug": "greg-sams"}], "topics": [{"id": 1822, "name": "philosophy", "path": "/academic/religion/religion/philosophy"}, {"id": 1019, "name": "astronomy", "path": "/science/physics/astronomy"}, {"id": 1149, "name": "astronomy", "path": "/society/history/astronomy"}, {"id": 1619, "name": "astronomy", "path": "/arts/poetry/astronomy"}], "supercategory": "academic", "venue": {"id": 449, "name": "The October Gallery", "slug": "the-october-gallery", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC1N 3AL"}, "organizer": {"id": 449, "name": "The October Gallery", "slug": "the-october-gallery"}, "date": "2010-03-30", "dates": [{"id": 8100, "from_date": "2010-03-30", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "18:00:00", "ticket_cost": "Entry £7 /£5 Concessions", "ticket_info": "RSVP so that we can anticipate numbers – Please book in advance by credit card to guarantee a place or pay on the door. \r\n(Tel: 44 (0)20 7831 1618). – email: rentals@octobergallery.co.uk\r\n", "additional_info": "Arrive 6pm for a 6:30pm Start - Wine available", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 449, "name": "The October Gallery", "slug": "the-october-gallery", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC1N 3AL"}, "organizer": {"id": 449, "name": "The October Gallery", "slug": "the-october-gallery"}}]}, {"id": 7726, "title": "The Occult Life of Dennis Wheatley", "synopsis": "Dennis Wheatley virtually invented the popular image of black magic and Satanism in twentieth century Britain", "keywords": "wheatley, occult, literature, horror", "body": "Dennis Wheatley virtually invented the popular image of black magic and Satanism in twentieth century Britain, and he made it all seem strangely seductive.

A new form of ethical accountability is called for that takes “Life” as the subject, not the object, of enquiry. This ethics is presented as a fundamental reconfiguration of our being in the world and it calls for more conceptual creativity in the production of worldviews that can better enable us to behave ethically in a technologically and globally mediated world.

Damage to the hippocampus is known to have a devastating impact on the ability to form new memories as well as compromising recollection of the past. Despite many decades of research, significant gaps in our knowledge remain, and we still don’t know how exactly activity across millions of hippocampal neurons supports a person’s lifetime of experiences.  Recent advances in brain imaging technology, however, now offer the prospect of decoding memories from neural activity in the hippocampus of humans in vivo.  Furthermore, in the last number of years it has become apparent that the hippocampus does not act alone in supporting memory.  Using brain imaging it has been possible to delineate a distributed network of brain regions involved in supporting memories of our personal experiences. Intriguingly, it has been discovered recently that these memory areas overlap considerably with those required for spatial navigation, and also imagining fictitious and future experiences. Understanding exactly what processes memory, navigation, imagination and thinking about the future have in common, and how they map onto specific brain areas such as the hippocampus is now a key question in cognitive neuroscience.  \r\n\r\nAdmission free – no ticket or advance booking required.\r\n\r\nRoyal Society events are frequently broadcast live on the web.\r\nVisit the video archive at www.royalsoc.ac.uk/live\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 60, "image_id": null, "added": "2008-09-01T05:58:25", "slug": "mapping-memory-the-brains-behind-remembering", "speakers": [{"id": 7167, "name": "Professor Eleanor Maguire", "slug": "professor-eleanor-maguire"}], "topics": [{"id": 374, "name": "cognitive", "path": "/academic/anthropology/cognitive"}, {"id": 928, "name": "neuroscience", "path": "/science/publicunderstandingofscience/neuroscience"}, {"id": 147, "name": "brain", "path": "/science/biology/brain"}, {"id": 149, "name": "brain", "path": "/science/psychology/brain"}], "supercategory": "academic", "venue": {"id": 44, "name": "The Royal Society", "slug": "the-royal-society", "city": "London", "postcode": "SW1Y 5AG"}, "organizer": {"id": 44, "name": "The Royal Society", "slug": "the-royal-society"}, "date": "2008-11-25", "dates": [{"id": 5983, "from_date": "2008-11-25", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "18:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": "This lecture is free - no ticket or advanced booking required.

Focusing on the tragic Franklin Expedition of 1845 it will argue that the driving force behind exploration by the mid century was scientific research, and that the key issue was the development of a general theory of terrestrial magnetism, which was directly linked to the Navy's concern to improve navigation and chart information. Professor Lambert will also reflect on his own experience tracking the Franklin expedition on King William Island.  \r\nProfessor Andrew Lambert is Laughton Professor of Naval History, Department of War Studies, King’s College London. He is currently writing a book about his journey to the Arctic in 2004 to follow Franklin’s last expedition.\r\n\r\nAND\r\n\r\nThe Great Game: Claiming and Colonizing the Antarctic (1908-1959) – Klaus Dodds\r\nThis talk considers how and with what consequences the Antarctic was claimed and colonized by scientists and military personnel. We consider how research stations and scientific research alongside commercial activities such as whaling played their part in a wider geopolitical game designed to assert control over the southerly continent. In the 1940s and 1950s, with the onset of the Cold War, these so-called 'sovereignty games' became all the more dangerous as the Americans and Soviets extended their interest in the Antarctic. The International Geophysical Year (1957-8) provided the key turning point - it was shown that science and geopolitics could co-exist with one another. In December 1959, despite fears to the contrary, a landmark treaty was signed in Washington DC. The Antarctic Treaty brought to a close this 50 year era of claiming and colonizing but, as the lecture will conclude, did not end controversy over the question of who owns the Antarctic.\r\nProfessor Klaus Dodds Professor of Geopolitics, Royal Holloway, University of London. Author of Geopolitics: A Very Short Introduction (2007), Global Geopolitics: A Critical Introduction (2005) and Pink Ice: Britain and the South Atlantic Empire (2002).

The lecture will challenge this view by proposing that these tales nevertheless constituted one means by which Chaucer was able to explore his abiding philosophical interests in human initiative and providence, and that this particularly comes through the plot of the most joyously and irreverently mischievous of them all, The Miller’s Tale.

The Dioxin found in Agent Orange continues to poison the land and destroy its people.\r\n\r\nThere is an estimated one million victims today.  Horrific birth defects are still been witnessed, now, in the grandchildren of those exposed.  Evidence of altered DNA?  Or from new contamination?

In Bien Hoa, 20000 people depend on the lake for their water supply, unknown to them, Dioxin levels here are 200 times WHO accepted levels, and the food chain is poisoned.  But the United States refuses to accept this evidence. Despite recognising and compensating their own troops for related illnesses, they do not acknowledge any Agent Orange poisoning in Vietnam.
