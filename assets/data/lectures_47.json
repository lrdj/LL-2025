The exploding profits of the multinational companies which dominate the water industry are testimony to how high the stakes are - by 2012 it had become a worth a trillion dollars.  \r\n\r\nThe Last Drop traces a path through the complex arguments that surround the question of water, setting out to make the technical and scientific arguments more accessible and the political questions more urgent.\r\n\r\nAgainst the market fundamentalists, Mike Gonzalez and Marianella Yanes argue that it is both possible and necessary that considerations of equity and social justice prevail in the debates around water. They call for our water supply to be saved from subordination to the whims of the multinationals and placed under direct democratic public control.

What had been a minor regional school achieved international prominence and influenced the future of European art in general for centuries. Central to this achievement was the genius of a succession of painters from Giovanni Bellini and his brother Gentile, Carpaccio, Giorgione, to the great Titian and his younger contemporaries Tintoretto and Veronese. These painters worked in a city undergoing crisis and change: the decline of its maritime empire, the reduction of its monopoly of trade with the East, its near destruction as a state in the early sixteenth century, and the religious turmoil engendered by the Reformation and the reaction of the Roman Church to it. Governed by an oligarchy of merchant nobles who elected a Doge, Venice remained politically stable throughout this turbulent period and continued to flourish economically.

His rise to fame was meteoric within Venice and at the death of Giovanni Bellini in 1516 he succeeded him as state painter. His great 'Assumption of the Virgin Mary' in the Franciscan church of the Frari was seen by contemporaries as a turning-point in the establishment of the new grand manner now called by art historians the 'High Renaissance' style.", "additional_info": null, "duration": 300, "image_id": null, "added": "2014-05-02T09:34:51", "slug": "1b3a85990121c6e1", "speakers": [{"id": 14666, "name": "Dr Michael Douglas-Scott", "slug": "dr-michael-douglas-scott"}], "topics": [{"id": 131, "name": "authors", "path": "/arts/literature/fiction/british/21stcentury/authors"}, {"id": 106, "name": "wwi", "path": "/arts/books/history/military/wwi"}, {"id": 107, "name": "wwii", "path": "/arts/books/history/military/wwii"}, {"id": 108, "name": "army", "path": "/arts/books/history/military/army"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 2725, "name": "The University Women's Club", "slug": "the-university-womens-club", "city": "London", "postcode": "W1K 1DB"}, "organizer": {"id": 2290, "name": "THE COURSE", "slug": "the-course"}, "date": "2014-11-13", "dates": [{"id": 14176, "from_date": "2014-11-13", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "10:45:00", "ticket_cost": "£46", "ticket_info": "info@thecoursestudies.co.uk", "additional_info": "visit www.thecoursestudies.co.uk", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 2725, "name": "The University Women's Club", "slug": "the-university-womens-club", "city": "London", "postcode": "W1K 1DB"}, "organizer": {"id": 2290, "name": "THE COURSE", "slug": "the-course"}}]}, {"id": 13651, "title": "Treasures of the Court / King Christian VIII of Denmark (transition from monarchy to state) (r. 1839", "synopsis": "Covering 500 years, 38 patrons and several continents, this course is an examination of audacious acts of patronage and how they resulted in some of the finest art collections in the world.\r\n", "keywords": "arts, art, history, royal collections, royal patronage, King Christian VIII of Denmark (r. 1839–1848)  Copenhagen Danish sculptor Bertel Thorvaldsen.", "body": "Christian VIII was extremely interested in culture and science so his reign saw the Court assume a pivotal role in Copenhagen's cultural life during the last decade of its Golden Age.

While space stations have become reality, there are as yet no true space habitats. Writers, filmmakers, and other artists have produced vivid renditions of the idea of a space station or habitat, and these iterations can be categorized by some of the basic scientific concepts from which they are derived.\r\n\r\nThe O'Neill cylinder is a space settlement design proposed by American physicist Gerard K. O'Neill in his 1976 book 'The High Frontier: Human Colonies in Space'. O'Neill proposed the colonisation of space for the 21st century, using materials extracted from the Moon and later from asteroids.\r\n\r\nAn O'Neill cylinder would consist of two counter-rotating cylinders. The cylinders would rotate in opposite directions in order to cancel out any gyroscopic effects that would otherwise make it difficult to keep them aimed toward the Sun. Each would be 5 miles (8.0 km) in diameter and 20 miles (32 km) long, connected at each end by a rod via a bearing system. They would rotate so as to provide artificial gravity via centrifugal force on their inner surfaces.\r\n\r\nGetting off a planet is costly and dangerous, and requires the expenditure of a great deal of energy.

The answer is uncomfortable: despite all its horrors, over the long run war itself has made the world a safer and richer place, because war alone has proved able to create larger societies that pacify themselves internally.

After learning all he could from imported prints and books he resolved to cross the Alps to study Italian art at first hand. Rather than travelling to Florence or Rome, Dürer stopped and stayed in Venice. On his arrival, Venetian artists received him with great honour but with some jealousy. The technical brilliance of his graphic work had made a big impact in Italy, yet his paintings were said to lack such qualities as the deep, rich colour for which Venetian art was renowned. Dürer was determined to ‘stop the mouths’ of his critics before returning to effect a revolution, a ‘renaissance’ in the arts in Germany. Close links between Venice and Germany had been long established and this course will examine this direct cultural cross-fertilisation, focusing on works Dürer produced in Italy under the inspiration of Giovanni Bellini, Giorgione and others, together with the influence Dürer’s work had upon them. The relationship between Italian art and other German painters such as Cranach or sculptors such as Riemenschneider will also be covered.", "keywords": "arts, art, history, architecture, classics,DUrer, Giorgione, Titian, Cranach, Riemenschneider, Renaissance arts, Germany,Giovanni Bellini, Giorgione, Venice,15th/early 16th century German sculpture.Altarpieces by Veit Stoss and Tilman Riemenschneider.", "body": "Encouraged by Dürer and others German sculpture, painting and architecture began to radically transform in the 16th century following the classical tradition of\r\nancient Greece and Rome.

Thinking about the interaction betwen words and music in vocal music, and about the ways in which their joint effect is perceived by listeners and performers, may help us better to understand the differences and similarities, the compatibilities and incompatibilities, of these two fundamental forms of human expression and communication.\r\n\r\nThe two half-day sessions of the seminar “Words and Music” will set up a dialogue between speakers specialising in different aspects of this question, including a musicologist, an audio scientist, a practising poet, a composer, and literary specialists. Please visit the HARC website for programme details: http://harcrhul.wordpress.com\r\n\r\nThe discussions in both sessions will thus be cross-disciplinary. The issues they will explore bear on fundamental questions such as interpretation, aesthetic form and the way it is experienced, cognitive processes and strategies, and the nature of communication.

About the Institut français du Royaume-Uni\r\n\r\nFounded in 1910 by a private benefactor, the Institut français is the official French government centre of language and culture, one of the 150 Instituts troughout the world and one of  the oldest French cultural centres based abroad. The Language Centre offers a wide range of courses in general or specialised French language, while the Cultural Centre stresses two areas: French, European and World cinema and cutting-edge writing and thought.\r\n\r\nh4. The Language Centre\r\n\r\nThe Language Centre offers tuition to over 6000 students a year and has 75 carefully selected, highly professional tutors. Courses are continually being adapted to suit the requirements of our students. In addition to traditional language courses, we have courses covering French culture, current affairs and business French.\r\n\r\nh4. Ciné lumière\r\n\r\nLaunched by Catherine Deneuve in March 1998, Ciné lumière is an independent showcase for the very best in French, European and world cinema. Our repertory features some 600 screenings a year. Festivals, seasons, retrospectives, premieres, new releases, guest star appearances: Ciné lumière is an everyday festival. A public cinema with 300 seats, Ciné lumière is open to everyone. You don't have to be a member of the Institut français - nor do you have to speak French! All films are shown in original version with English subtitles.\r\n\r\nh4. The Multimedia Library\r\n\r\nOur multimedia library offers free access to 52 000 items: books, French newspapers and magazines, videos & DVDs, CDs  and CD-ROMs aimed at Francophiles, French speakers or learners. The library also supplies information services such as the Quick Information Service which provides information and documentation on contemporary France and francophone countries, and the Studies in France Information Desk which promotes cultural and educational exchanges between France and Great Britain.\r\n\r\nh4. Talks Programme\r\n\r\nThe Institut français has a varied programme of talks, giving a wide range of speakers the opportunity to express themselves freely and enter into a dialogue with the public. Thanks to the book launches our audiences are the first to know about the latest translations from French and publications about France.\r\n\r\nh4. French Music Bureau\r\n\r\nThe French Music Bureau is a unique collaboration between the French Government (Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Culture) and the domestic music industry to improve the profile of French popular music in both the UK and worldwide markets. The bureau aims to act as a consultant and offers assistance in the development of artists in every genre of French popular contemporary music. It is an essential communication resource, building a cultural network of coordination, advice, promotion and information with French, British and foreign media, educational institutions and music professionals. \r\n", "members_only": "No", "members_info": "monde-diplo-friends@mondediplo.com", "venue": {"id": 262, "name": "Institut Francais", "slug": "institut-francais", "city": "London", "postcode": "SW7 2DT"}, "organizer": {"id": 262, "name": "Institut Francais", "slug": "institut-francais"}}]}, {"id": 1325, "title": "New Banners", "synopsis": "Join Director Nick Mansfield for a tour and short introduction to the new banners on display in the museum.", "keywords": "banners\r\nhistory", "body": "Join Director Nick Mansfield for a tour and short introduction to the new banners on display in the museum.
