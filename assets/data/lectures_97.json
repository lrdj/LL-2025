James Lees-Milne, the Mitfords ", "body": "Lady   Bridget  Parsons was born in 1907 and died in 1972. She is an enigma,  a member of the Irish aristocracy, her brother  married Ann Amstrong-Jones ( mother of the famous Tony Armstrong- Jones, husband of  Princess Margaret)  “The good fairy, at Bridget’s   birth, endowed her with rare gifts: exceptional looks, a probing intelligence [ and]…a unique fastidiousness..”\r\n\r\nBridget’s life    spans  three quarters of the 20th Century.  Although she’s largely  forgotten,    she was at one time on the ‘A list’ of personalities. She appears in almost every diary/ memoir  of  the fast and furious members of British Society in the pre and post war era.   Bridget   pops up in  the  memoirs / diaries/ biographies  of   well  known folk  of her day,  like the Mosleys, the Nicolsons,   Nancy and Deborah  Mitford,   Daphne Fielding, John Betjemin, James Lees- Milne, Sacheverell Sitwell, Robin Bryans, Patrick Leigh Fermor,  Clarissa Eden, Ann Fleming,  Cynthia Gladwyn and  Anthony Powell.  These references provide a  very good,  colourful  stock of anecdotes and  observations of  Bridget’s  strengths and flaws. Her antics  reflect  her often  enigmatic  and changing personality,  her  swings of mood and struggle for independence as a modern woman. \r\n\r\nBridget never made herself  an easy target for the predatory males of the time  that thought all woman were a soft touch.  Bridget famously  hit the headlines in the 1960s in a curious Court case when she was arrested and incarcerated by the police over a petty driving offence, almost certainly revenge by one or other of her male enemies.    \r\n\r\nSo who was Bridget Parsons?  Why should she be remembered today? Will Cross has researched her’ life and times and  offers a unique insight into a remarkable  woman who established in her own way a milestone for a woman’s equality against men.                                            \r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 120, "image_id": 2731, "added": "2018-06-07T13:14:59", "slug": "93f8f37ff28d5497", "speakers": [{"id": 13766, "name": "Mr William  Cross", "slug": "mr-william-cross"}], "topics": [{"id": 4249, "name": "irish", "path": "/arts/books/talk/irish"}, {"id": 687, "name": "society", "path": "/arts/architecture/planning/society"}, {"id": 1024, "name": "society", "path": "/arts/literature/french/society"}, {"id": 2687, "name": "society", "path": "/arts/literature/writing/society"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 3058, "name": "Newport U3A", "slug": "newport-u3a", "city": "Newport", "postcode": "NP20 5JH"}, "organizer": {"id": 2861, "name": "William Cross, FSA Scot", "slug": "william-cross-fsa-scot"}, "date": "2018-09-06", "dates": [{"id": 16736, "from_date": "2018-09-06", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "13:30:00", "ticket_cost": "See Club Secretary", "ticket_info": "See Club Secretary", "additional_info": "William Cross, FSA Scot has written biographies of men and women in the British peerage, she has published several books on the Morgans of Tredegar House, Newport, South Wales and the Carnarvons of Highclere Castle ( the back drop to TV's Downton Abbey)  ", "members_only": "Yes", "members_info": "Members and Guests", "venue": {"id": 3058, "name": "Newport U3A", "slug": "newport-u3a", "city": "Newport", "postcode": "NP20 5JH"}, "organizer": {"id": 2861, "name": "William Cross, FSA Scot", "slug": "william-cross-fsa-scot"}}]}, {"id": 16040, "title": "Mothers, Sisters, Resisters?

Knowing yourself is important but a fresh approach to understanding its value is needed. The difficulty we face is that the most genuinely valuable types of self-knowledge are also the most challenging to acquire and the hardest to live with.\r\n\r\nQuassim Cassam is the author of several books, including Self-Knowledge for Humans (2014). He is Professor of Philosophy at the University of Warwick and has also taught at Oxford, Cambridge and UCL. He writes about what he calls ‘substantial’ self-knowledge, including knowledge of our emotions, values and character, and focuses on the effect of our cognitive imperfections on our ability to gain self-knowledge. More recently he has written about intellectual vices and the difficulty of knowing our own vices.\r\n\r\nDoors 10.30.

How we come to act in this way is economic, both in the sense that we fulfil a profitable role in a politically organised cultural economy, and that our role affirms and maintains the unnameable and abstracted values that sustain the economy of the object we encounter. An alternative animistic and psychoanalytic history of objects exist in which they act on us persuasively. Recent object-oriented philosophies suggest that objects (for instance art objects) need to be decoupled from their subjectification within human cognition. In turn I want to propose that we, as the publics of objects, desubject ourselves from the economy of spectatorship however superficially diversified and demand that exhibitions and their institutions change in favour of our new viewing needs, wherein we are no longer subservient to the (economy of the) objects we encounter. \r\n\r\nFor further information, click here - http://www.independentdance.co.uk/programmepage/exchanges/crossing-borders/\r\n\r\nTickets:&#8232;Single talk £6 | £4 freelance and concession&#8232;3-talk cards £16.50 | £10.50 freelance and concession\r\n\r\nDrinks Offer: Free drinks voucher for the first 20 people who book for any talk \r\n\r\nTo book, please call 020 7091 9650 or email info@independentdance.co.uk\r\n\r\nVenue:\r\nIndependent Dance\r\nSiobhan Davies Studios \r\n85 St. Georges Road\r\nLondon\r\nSE1 6ER\r\n\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 1768, "added": "2014-10-05T17:45:01", "slug": "14dd94c7e0e2ad7f", "speakers": [{"id": 655, "name": "Andrea Philips", "slug": "andrea-philips"}], "topics": [{"id": 2676, "name": "dance", "path": "/arts/arts/education/dance"}, {"id": 1869, "name": "performance", "path": "/arts/film/videoart/performance"}, {"id": 3399, "name": "performance", "path": "/arts/art/contemporaryart/performance"}, {"id": 1018, "name": "talk", "path": "/arts/education/debate/talk"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 1781, "name": "Independent Dance", "slug": "independent-dance", "city": "London", "postcode": "SE1 6ER"}, "organizer": {"id": 1781, "name": "Independent Dance", "slug": "independent-dance"}, "date": "2014-10-07", "dates": [{"id": 14659, "from_date": "2014-10-07", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "7:00:00", "ticket_cost": "£4-£6", "ticket_info": "Please call Siobhan Davies reception on 020 7091 9650 or email info@independentdance.co.uk.", "additional_info": null, "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 1781, "name": "Independent Dance", "slug": "independent-dance", "city": "London", "postcode": "SE1 6ER"}, "organizer": {"id": 1781, "name": "Independent Dance", "slug": "independent-dance"}}]}, {"id": 14024, "title": "The computing universe: origins of computational thinking", "synopsis": "This talk will explore the origins of computers and of ‘computational thinking’.

While climate conspiracy theories may seem a distraction from the challenge of dealing with a changing global climate, they provide a starting point for an exploration of a related burning issue: the state of democratic politics today, and the hopes we invest in it.\r\n\r\nThis lecture will begin with an impersonation: a double-act. Two members of the University’s Conspiracy & Democracy research project, Professor David Runciman and Dr Alfred Moore, will represent two very different types of climate conspiracist. Here’s a quick guide to their world views.\r\n\r\nConspiracy theory one: climate change is a hoax. Environmentalists and scientists have secretly coordinated to conjure the fear of a warming planet in order to justify their own ideological projects and serve their own professional interests. They mask disagreement and present the world with a 'consensus' that nobody is allowed to question. The veil was lifted by the Climategate affair, which showed leading climate scientists colluding to suppress awkward data, hide their own work from critical scrutiny, and marginalise dissenters. Climate scientists are bound by membership in big institutions, research universities, and intergovernmental panels. Dissenting experts are free of the pernicious compromises of institutions. Behind the science of climate change lies conspiracy.\r\n\r\nConspiracy theory two: the climate change conspiracy is itself a conspiracy. There is no credible disagreement on the science of climate change. The only dissent comes from industry-funded studies, think-tanks and websites. They are following the tobacco industry playbook of manufacturing doubt and emphasising uncertainty, in order to prevent public action that would cost them money. Climategate was a manufactured controversy. Those emails didn’t reveal a conspiracy or a cover-up. They revealed the ordinary backstage of scientific life, conducted under intense pressure from partisan opponents. And is it a coincidence that the emails were leaked just days before the Copenhagen summit on climate change policy?\r\n\r\nFor all their obvious differences, these two ways of looking at climate change have a surprising amount in common. They both focus more on discrediting the narratives of their opponents than on identifying an actual conspiracy.

Mehdi Hasan and James Macintyre's book,  ED: The Milibands and the making of a Labour leader|, reveals where he has come from and where he is going. It charts his unique upbringing, against the backdrop of tragedy and with a prominent Marxist thinker for a father. ED follows his coming of age at Oxford, his election to Parliament and asks whether the pressures of being Labour party leader are swaying him from deep personal and ideological convictions. But Ed’s story cannot be fully understood outside the context of his struggle to emerge from the shadow of his elder brother, David. Ed followed David to the same college at Oxford, into Parliament and into the Cabinet before, at the eleventh hour, snatching away David’s dream of the leadership. Ed Miliband’s political hero is Robert Kennedy but, unlike the Kennedys, the Milibands fought to the bitter end, rather than supporting one another. ED gets to the heart of the dramatic decision-making that led him to join that epic leadership battle and reveals the hidden truth behind the making of a Labour leader. \r\n\r\nMehdi Hasan is Senior Editor (Politics) at the New Statesman and is a former newsstand- current-affairs editor at Channel 4.

Gearty has a particular view of his subject, believing human rights to be the only potentially radical and genuinely universal idea available to us in this post-socialist world of fear, money and lost souls. Too important to be left to lawyers but too subversive to be handed over to the politicians alone, human rights need the intellectuals, the workers and the streets if their model of a new kind of society has any chance of beginning to be built.\r\n\r\nEach essay will be open to discussion and debate on the web and Gearty will adapt and improve his original thoughts through the engagement they generate. There will be an opportunity for alternative essays, votes on particular propositions and the development of rival points of view. Here is a chance not only to receive but to give, to speak as well as listen.

Biological organisms have adapted to these in many ways which for mammals, include sleep/wake activity cycles and fertility cycles.\r\n\r\nIn addition to cyclical responses to external stimuli, oscillatory changes are also generated within the bodies of simple and complex animals. One of the systems critical for life in mammals is the hormonal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. This is a hormonal system which produces the steroid hormone cortisol in man and regulates our response to stress as well as cognitive function and many metabolic activities. Although previously considered to be a hormonal system that exerts its actions by analogue effects of cortisol concentrations in tissues of the body, it is now becoming clear that cortisol levels oscillate and that these oscillations are critical for optimal bodily function. \r\n\r\nProf Lightman will describe the mechanisms through which the body achieves oscillating hormone levels and why these are so important.", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": null, "added": "2010-08-18T10:35:42", "slug": "66172696c7f85b1b", "speakers": [{"id": 10031, "name": "Professor  Stafford Lightman", "slug": "professor-stafford-lightman"}], "topics": [{"id": 70, "name": "biology", "path": "/science/biology"}, {"id": 69, "name": "science", "path": "/science"}], "supercategory": "science", "venue": {"id": 2, "name": "The Royal Institution of Great Britain", "slug": "the-royal-institution-of-great-britain", "city": "London", "postcode": "W1S 4BS"}, "organizer": {"id": 2, "name": "The Royal Institution of Great Britain", "slug": "the-royal-institution-of-great-britain"}, "date": "2010-10-29", "dates": [{"id": 9035, "from_date": "2010-10-29", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "19:45:00", "ticket_cost": "Free to Ri Full Members/ £10 Associate Members/ £15 guests", "ticket_info": "www.rigb.org", "additional_info": null, "members_only": "No", "members_info": "Available through the website, www.rigb.org.\r\n", "venue": {"id": 2, "name": "The Royal Institution of Great Britain", "slug": "the-royal-institution-of-great-britain", "city": "London", "postcode": "W1S 4BS"}, "organizer": {"id": 2, "name": "The Royal Institution of Great Britain", "slug": "the-royal-institution-of-great-britain"}}]}, {"id": 8211, "title": "A lecture by Catherine Ashton, High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Sec", "synopsis": "LSE European Institute – APCO Worldwide Perspectives on Europe Series in partnership with Business for New Europe ", "keywords": "European Union, EU, international relations, foreign affairs, international security ", "body": "Baroness Catherine Ashton is the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, and Vice President of the European Commission.

From inventing virtual reality and creating the world's first immersive avatars, as one of the premier designers at work today he received in 2009 a lifetime achievement award from the IEEE and was named one of the top 100 public intellectuals by Prospect and Foreign Policy.\r\n\r\nThis event celebrates the publication of his latest book You are Not a Gadget.\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 732, "added": "2010-01-11T19:00:27", "slug": "243b72bba4a56572", "speakers": [{"id": 9254, "name": "Jaron Lanier", "slug": "jaron-lanier"}, {"id": 9255, "name": "Chair Jerry  Fishenden", "slug": "chair-jerry-fishenden"}], "topics": [{"id": 687, "name": "society", "path": "/arts/architecture/planning/society"}, {"id": 1024, "name": "society", "path": "/arts/literature/french/society"}, {"id": 123, "name": "mobility", "path": "/society/urbanisation/planning/mobility"}, {"id": 313, "name": "technology", "path": "/arts/philosophy/technology"}, {"id": 441, "name": "computerscience", "path": "/academic/computerscience"}, {"id": 332, "name": "philosophy", "path": "/academic/philosophy"}, {"id": 1583, "name": "technology", "path": "/academic/philosophy/technology"}, {"id": 1976, "name": "digitalrevolution", "path": "/academic/philosophy/digitalrevolution"}, {"id": 1977, "name": "web", "path": "/academic/computerscience/web"}, {"id": 1978, "name": "moderntechnology", "path": "/academic/computerscience/moderntechnology"}, {"id": 1979, "name": "virtualreality", "path": "/academic/computerscience/virtualreality"}, {"id": 1980, "name": "avatars", "path": "/academic/computerscience/avatars"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 2152, "name": "Sheikh Zayed Theatre, New Academic Building", "slug": "sheikh-zayed-theatre-new-academic-building", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC2A 2AE"}, "organizer": {"id": 1287, "name": "London School of Economics & Political Science", "slug": "london-school-of-economics-political-science"}, "date": "2010-02-02", "dates": [{"id": 8016, "from_date": "2010-02-02", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "18:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": null, "additional_info": "This event is free and open to all with no ticket required.

Even where literary argumentation has had non-traditional aims (e.g. deconstructionist, feminist, neo-Marxist, post-colonialist), this form of critique has been largely monologic and text-based.  However, the recent marked growth in reading groups as a contemporary cultural phenomenon provides an opportunity to investigate dialogic literary argumentation at scale, something largely uninvestigated from a linguistic perspective.\r\n\r\nThis presentation will make a contribution to understanding the discourse of reading groups, shining light on the kind of argumentation used in evaluation and interpretation of books read in a variety of reading groups.  I will report on the findings of The Discourse of Reading Groups – a UK Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) one-year, funded project (2008) that aims both to gather evidence about contemporary reading practices, and to contribute to a sensitive understanding of social literary argumentation as a contemporary micro-culture.\r\n\r\nThe research questions for this presentation are as follows: how are evaluations and interpretations constructed, justified, contested, developed between participants?

Many change makers around the world are using Spiral Dynamics to solve real, complex issues - from ending apartheid in South Africa to rewriting law enforcement policy in Holland to discovering new growth strategies for multinationals.\r\n\r\nSee website for workshop details.\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 480, "image_id": null, "added": "2009-02-24T08:09:15", "slug": "ef35b0a8e9dde435", "speakers": [{"id": 2782, "name": "Dr Don Beck", "slug": "dr-don-beck"}], "topics": [{"id": 1474, "name": "culture", "path": "/academic/society/culture/culture"}, {"id": 170, "name": "newtopic", "path": "/science/chemistry/biochemistry/catalysis/newtopic"}, {"id": 1399, "name": "evolution", "path": "/academic/science/philosophy/engineering/biology/medicine/evolut"}, {"id": 1398, "name": "evolution", "path": "/academic/science/philosophy/engineering/biology/medicine/evolut"}], "supercategory": "academic", "venue": {"id": 809, "name": "EnlightenNext", "slug": "enlightennext", "city": "Islington", "postcode": "N1 8QG"}, "organizer": {"id": 809, "name": "EnlightenNext", "slug": "enlightennext"}, "date": "2009-03-14", "dates": [{"id": 6807, "from_date": "2009-03-14", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "9:00:00", "ticket_cost": "£40", "ticket_info": "http://www.ticketweb.co.uk/user/?region=gb_london&query=detail&event=308858&interface=", "additional_info": "WEBSITE:http://www.andrewcohen.org/london/donbeck/asp\r\nPHONE:0207 2887 000\r\nEMAIL:info.london@enlightennext.org", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 809, "name": "EnlightenNext", "slug": "enlightennext", "city": "Islington", "postcode": "N1 8QG"}, "organizer": {"id": 809, "name": "EnlightenNext", "slug": "enlightennext"}}]}, {"id": 6463, "title": "The Sophy's Englishman: Robert Sherley and his Persian Odyssey", "synopsis": "Explores the life of Robert Sherley, who arrived in Persia at 18 and eventually became an ambassador for Shah 'Abbas", "keywords": "Shah 'Abbas, Robert Sherley, ambassador", "body": "Independent scholar Edward Faridany retells the extraordinary tale of Robert Sherley, who arrived at the court of Shah 'Abbas in 1598 at the age of 18.

Exponent of a distinct magical gnosis and writer of many books, he has produced a formidable and highly creative body of work, expressing approaches which have evolved throughout the years. At the heart of this work is the series of Typhonian Trilogies, commencing with The Magical Revival in 1972 and culminating in The Ninth Arch in 2002. In this talk Michael Staley will discuss the fundamental aspects of this work, as well as the ways in which Grant set out to develop Thelema and creative occultism in the light of the Typhonian or Draconian Current.\r\n\r\nGrant’s work has grown out of an extraordinary life. He had a passion for magic, mysticism and comparative religion by the time he met Aleister Crowley in 1944 -- a contact which made a profound impact upon him. Later, he and his wife had a close association with the occult artist Austin Osman Spare. Spare’s work also had a huge influence upon Grant, but it was through his own magical and mystical experience that Grant was able to assimilate the work of these two and many others including Woodroffe, Massey, Blavatsky, and Lovecraft to form a vision that suffuses all his work but finds its most profound flowering in the Typhonian Trilogies.\r\n\r\nThis lecture focuses on Grant’s work as expressed in the Typhonian Trilogies, and lays the foundation for a forthcoming series of talks which will focus more closely on specific elements of his work.\r\n\r\nMichael Staley is a prominent member of the magical order headed by Kenneth Grant, edits the well-respected journal ‘Starfire’, and is the founder of Starfire Publishing Ltd.

She is also interested in the impact of these processes on empathy and emotion perception. Part of her research involves working with people with Asperger’s Syndrome, a form of autism whereby language ability and intelligence are intact. People with Asperger’s Syndrome find some aspects of social perception and empathy difficult. She also works with people who report a condition called Depersonalisation – sufferers of which often talk of feeling emotionally numb or detached from their body and/or mental processes.\r\n\r\nDr Lawrence works within the framework of Cognitive neuropsychiatry which views psychological and behavioural difficulties as occurring when the usual mental processes and their brain correlates become altered. This can be due to a multitude of factors such as psychological and/or environmental triggers, brain injury, and unusual brain development .\r\n\r\nJulie Freeman’ work spans visual, audio and digital artforms and explores the relationship between science, nature and how humans interact with it. For the past 12 years her work has focused on using electronic technologies to ‘translate nature’ – whether it is through the sound of torrential rain dripping on a giant rhubarb leaf; a pair of mobile concrete speakers who lurk in galleries haranguing passersby with fractured sonic samples or by providing an interactive platform from which to view the flap, twitch and prick of dogs’ ears.

The emphasis now is on material science and the development of new and exciting fabrics, each with different characteristics that can spark a whole new catwalk trend. Fashion designers are now just as likely to collaborate with experts in smart fabrics and hi-tech printing techniques, as work with traditional tailors.

Access to The Photographers' Gallery\r\n\r\nBoth ground floors have ramped access. The Gallery has a toilet fully equipped with disabled facilities. Access to the Print Sales Gallery is by the staircase only: the listed status of the building does not allow for the installation of a lift. \r\n\r\nh3. History\r\n\r\nThe Photographers' Gallery, the first independent gallery in Britain devoted  to photography, was founded in 1971 at 8 Great Newport Street. This building  now houses the Gallery's primary exhibition space and a bookshop. In 1980  the Gallery also moved into 5 Great Newport Street, initially rented,  the freehold was purchased in 1986 thanks to a successful funding campaign.\r\n\r\nThe Gallery has developed a reputation as this country's primary venue  for contemporary photography. One of its major achievements has been to  establish photography within a wide viewing public, making it more popular  and accessible. The gallery was the first in the country to show key names  in world photography such as Andr&eacute; Kertesz, Jaques-Henri Lartigue  and Irving Penn, and has been instrumental in encouraging the inclusion  of photography in the programme of leading galleries and museums. An integrated  programme of exhibitions and educational events continues to present the  most innovative developments in photography as well as nuturing new talent.\r\n\r\nIn 1993, both buildings in Great Newport Street underwent extensive  refurbishment, designed by architect Nick England \r\n\r\nh3. Present\r\n\r\nThe Photographers' Gallery has been instrumental in establishing and promoting  the names of contemporary British photographers including Martin Parr  and Fay Goodwin. More recently, the Gallery has introduced significant  international artists working with photography, such as Rineke Dijkstra,  Annelies Strba, Catherine Opie and Boris Mikhailov, to audiences in Britain.  We also place strong emphasis on facilitating the production of new work  by emerging artists, both from Britain and abroad, in the form of commissions.  The Gallery stages exhibitions which throw new light on the history of  photography through exhibitions such as Francesca Woodman, Robert Capa,  Gordon Parks and Garry Winogrand. Every year, the Gallery hosts and produces  _Citibank Photography Prize_, now recognised as one of the most important  international art awards.\r\n\r\nThe Gallery is a registered educational charity (No. 262548) committed  to increasing visual literacy and access to photography. The Photographers'  Gallery receives some funding from London Arts, and raises additional  income from the Bookshop and Print Sales Gallery. However this is insufficient  to cover running costs and the development of our programme, so we rely  on the generosity of individuals, companies, trusts and foundations to  enable us to continue to develop our innovative programme of exhibitions  and education projects.\r\n\r\nh3. Events\r\n\r\nTalks, tours and events on photography and visual culture for individuals,  students, teachers and groups of all ages and levels of experience.\r\n\r\nh3.
