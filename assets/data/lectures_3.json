Friday 8th March 2019, 14.30 – 15.30\r\n\r\nWhere? Room V105, Vine building, Middlesex University, London, NW4 4BT\r\n\r\nIn the context of Cyprus, Standard Modern Greek and Cypriot Greek have traditionally been viewed as two discrete and mutually exclusive linguistic entities that form a binary diglossic opposition à la Ferguson (1959) with Standard Modern Greek being the High code and Cypriot Greek being the Low code (Moschonas, 1996, 2002; Arvaniti 2006/2010). More recent proposals, however, describe a register continuum (Tsiplakou, Papapavlou, Pavlou & Katsoyannou, 2006; Papapavlou & Sophocleous, 2009). At the one end of the continuum, we find an acrolectal register that incorporates a high number of lexical, phonological and grammatical features (thought to be) found in the standard variety of the language as it is spoken in Greece. At the other end, we find a basilectal register that incorporates a high number of features originating in the regional varieties of Greek spoken in Cyprus. One of the two main labels that speakers of Cypriot Greek use to describe this register is xorkátika (cipriaká) ‘villagey (Cypriot)’, associating it with notions of rurality and a general lack of sophistication and manners captured collectively under the related label xorka&#952;có ‘peasantry’.\r\n\r\nIn this contribution, I draw on data collected as part of a larger ethnographic investigation of language practices among London’s Greek Cypriot diaspora (see Karatsareas, 2018) to argue that, in London and as a result of being transplanted from a rural to an urban context where the majority language is English, Cypriot Greek was re-enregistered (in the sense of Agha, 2003, 2007) on the basis of ideological conceptualisations of English non-standard varieties vis-à-vis Standard English. Evidence in support of this thesis is found in the fact that, in addition to the known label xorkátika (cipriaká), British-born speakers of Cypriot Greek, who are dominant in English, describe their heritage language as a type of Greek ‘slang’ and also as spazména (elliniká) ‘broken (Greek)’, two labels unknown to the Cyprus context. In the use of the former term, we see the recognition of the informality and orality of Cypriot Greek as well as of the ways in which it challenges social and linguistic conventions. The latter term is not applied, as would be expected, to contact-induced phenomena in the speech of English-dominant speakers that would be ungrammatical in the speech of Cypriot Greek monolinguals. Rather, it is applied to basilectal features of Cypriot Greek such as the postalveolar fricative [t&#643;] and words that contain it such as t&#643;e ‘and’ by virtue of their lack from acrolectal registers and Standard Modern Greek. This suggests that, in the diasporic context, the similarities between basilectal registers of Cypriot Greek and non-standard English varieties in terms of informality, orality and difference from the respective standards enhanced the pre-existing perception that Cypriot Greek is an inferior form of language.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBio\r\n\r\nDr Petros Karatsareas is a Lecturer in English Language and Linguistics at the University of Westminster. He holds a Ptychion in Greek Philology from the University of Athens, and an M.Phil. in Linguistics and a Ph.D. in Linguistics from the University of Cambridge. He specialises in multilingualism focusing on the languages of the UK’s minority ethnic communities. He explores the factors that play a role in intergenerational transmission and maintenance, looking specifically at ideologies of monolingualism, attitudes towards multilingualism, and attitudes towards non-prestigious linguistic varieties. He is also interested in community language teaching and learning looking at how community languages are taught in complementary schools and the role these schools play in language maintenance and ideology.\r\n\r\nHe addresses these issues based on his research on London’s Greek Cypriot diaspora. He is also actively involved in a range of public engagement activities raising awareness about the value of non-standard linguistic varieties and about the contribution of the Greek Cypriot community to London’s multicultural and multilingual character. His research has received the financial support of the British Academy, the Leverhulme Trust and the Arts and Humanities Research Council (through the Open World Research Initiative).", "additional_info": null, "duration": 60, "image_id": null, "added": "2018-10-04T23:21:01", "slug": "153d08113935242d", "speakers": [{"id": 16877, "name": "Dr Petros Karatsareas", "slug": "dr-petros-karatsareas"}], "topics": [{"id": 1333, "name": "linguistics", "path": "/academic/arts/linguistics/linguistics"}, {"id": 862, "name": "language", "path": "/academic/arts/english/language"}, {"id": 821, "name": "london", "path": "/academic/history/war/london"}, {"id": 1889, "name": "london", "path": "/arts/history/localhistory/london"}], "supercategory": "academic", "venue": {"id": 3467, "name": "English, Middlesex University", "slug": "english-middlesex-university", "city": "London", "postcode": "NW4 4BT"}, "organizer": {"id": 3467, "name": "English, Middlesex University", "slug": "english-middlesex-university"}, "date": "2019-03-08", "dates": [{"id": 16844, "from_date": "2019-03-08", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "14:30:00", "ticket_cost": "free", "ticket_info": null, "additional_info": "Click here to see all 2018-19 Language & Communication research seminars: https://londonenglish.live/2018/09/18/language-and-communication-research-seminars-2018-19/", "members_only": "No", "members_info": "The Language and Communication Research Seminars are free and open to all staff, students and guests.\r\n\r\nFor any questions or if you would like to lead a session, contact Anna Charalambidou (a.charalambidou@mdx.ac.uk)", "venue": {"id": 3467, "name": "English, Middlesex University", "slug": "english-middlesex-university", "city": "London", "postcode": "NW4 4BT"}, "organizer": {"id": 3467, "name": "English, Middlesex University", "slug": "english-middlesex-university"}}]}, {"id": 16122, "title": "Romania and the First World War", "synopsis": "Military historian Major General Dr Mihail E.

He is also, as he confesses, a petty thief; he does not steal for gain, but for the thrill of it. HIs worst theft is Polly, the wife of his friend Marcus, with whom he has had an affair. When the affair is discovered, Oliver hides himself away in his childhood home. From here he tells the story of a year, from one autumn to the next. Many surprises and shocks await him, and by the end of his story, he will be forced to face himself and seek a road towards redemption.\r\n\r\nBiography: \r\nJohn Banville was born in Wexford, Ireland, in 1945. He was educated at Christian Brothers Schools and St. Peter's College, Wexford. He worked in journalism from 1969. He was Literary Editor at The Irish Times from 1988 to 1999. Banville had worked across many forms and won acclaim for his screenplays, radio and TV work. His first novel, Nightspawn, came out in 1971. Subsequent novels include Kepler (1980), Athena (1995), Eclipse (2000), The Sea (2005), and The Infinities (2010). His non-fiction book, Prague Pictures: Portraits of a City, was published in 2003.Among the awards John Banville's novels have won are the James Tait Black Memorial Prize, the Guardian Fiction, the Premio Nonino.

Most machine learning methods build on statistics, but one can also try to go beyond this, assaying causal structures underlying statistical dependences. Can such causal knowledge help prediction in machine learning tasks? We argue that this is indeed the case, due to the fact that causal models are more robust to changes that occur in real world datasets. We touch upon the implications of causal models for machine learning tasks such as domain adaptation, transfer learning, and semi-supervised learning. We also present an application to the removal of systematic errors for the purpose of exoplanet detection. \r\n\r\nMachine learning currently mainly focuses on relatively well-studied statistical methods. Some of the causal problems are conceptually harder, however, the causal point of view can provide additional insights that have substantial potential for data analysis.\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 60, "image_id": null, "added": "2015-04-10T21:13:43", "slug": "53a1f6311e2d48fa", "speakers": [{"id": 15494, "name": "Prof. Dr. Bernhard Schölkopf", "slug": "prof-dr-bernhard-schölkopf"}], "topics": [{"id": 709, "name": "statistics", "path": "/science/mathematics/statistics"}, {"id": 1408, "name": "future", "path": "/business/management/future"}, {"id": 3313, "name": "future", "path": "/science/philosophy/future"}], "supercategory": "science", "venue": {"id": 3091, "name": "Microsoft Research", "slug": "microsoft-research", "city": "Cambridge", "postcode": "CB1 2FB"}, "organizer": {"id": 3091, "name": "Microsoft Research", "slug": "microsoft-research"}, "date": "2015-05-15", "dates": [{"id": 15143, "from_date": "2015-05-15", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "16:45:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": "Please register for this talk to ensure your place: http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/events/msdrl/tcml.aspx", "additional_info": "Please contact msrcenq@microsoft.com for more information.", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 3091, "name": "Microsoft Research", "slug": "microsoft-research", "city": "Cambridge", "postcode": "CB1 2FB"}, "organizer": {"id": 3091, "name": "Microsoft Research", "slug": "microsoft-research"}}]}, {"id": 14591, "title": "The first 150 years of trying to understand MND", "synopsis": "The RCN and Motor Neurone Disease Association present three free public lectures.", "keywords": "History, culture, medicine, health care", "body": "The RCN and Motor Neurone Disease Association are working in partnership to present three free public lectures in 2015.

Such analyses are extremely important, particularly given the immense prices - often over £1million - for which manuscripts (especially medieval ones), paintings, icons and other works of art can be sold.

The lectures are challenging and interactive.  Audience members are asked to raise their hands in response to a series of questions about their attitudes to a political issue of the day.

In January 2011 he hosted a discussion for\r\nBBC Four at the Royal Institution on fairness in public policy and the Big Society.

I will compare nineteenth century and contemporary West Yorkshire (WY) auxn’t forms and argue that WY has never had a *amn’t gap. WY exhibits a phenomenon called secondary contraction, whereby shouldn’t, for example, may be pronounced so that it is homophonous with shunt. I will explore the role that so-called secondary contraction has played in the *amn’t gap saga. Although the focus will be on WY, I will explore the possibility that secondary contraction applied to certain auxn’t forms in Standard British English at a much earlier date.

The conventional mechanical compression air conditioning systems consume a significant amount of electrical energy that is largely dependent upon fossil fuel. This mode of air conditioning is therefore neither sustainable nor environment-friendly. Evaporative cooling utilizes the latent heat of water evaporation, a natural energy existing in the ambient, to perform free (or nearly free) air conditioning of buildings, and is therefore a potential replacement of the conventional systems. Evaporative cooling has its limits but a recently emerged dew point cooling technology breaks these limits and allows the supply air to be cooled to a level below the wet bulb and above the dew point of the inlet air, resulting in an increase to the systems cooling capacity. In the lecture, Professor Zhao presents the details of the new dew point cooling technology and explores its potential application in building air conditioning.\r\n\r\nProfessor Xudong Zhao is the Professor in Low Carbon Society at Institute of Energy and Sustainable Development, De Montfort University.

But, he asks, if the end of capitalism seems to many like the end of the world, how is it possible for Western society to face up to the end times? In a major new analysis of our global situation, Slavok Žižek argues that our collective responses to economic Armageddon correspond to the stages of grief: ideological denial, explosions of anger and attempts at bargaining, followed by depression and withdrawal. After passing through this zero-point, we can begin to perceive the crisis as a chance for a new beginning.

Rooted in disarming observational comedy, her novels give voice both to the Arabic-influenced backslang (verlan) spoken by young immigrants and the ‘straight’ French of her education, in a creative mix skilfully rendered by her translator and co-speaker, Sarah Ardizzone. Dubbed ‘the Sagan of the suburbs’, Guène develops her political concerns, comic flair and linguistic inventiveness in her second book Dreams from the Endz (Vintage). \r\n\r\nFaïza Guène was born in France in 1985 to Algerian parents.

But what happens when one or more of these senses is deficient or absent? Much of what we learn about ourselves and the world around us comes through our sight and hearing. Lacking these two ‘distance senses’, dual-sensory impaired (deafblind) people find that their mobility, communication and access to information is usually greatly affected. Conversely, might it be that deafblind individuals have better touch sensitivity due, in part, to touch taking over the visual part of the brain? Join David and Mark as they use interactive demonstration to explore the link between perception and sensory development and take a particular look at CHARGE Syndrome – multi sensory impairment in its most extreme form. What do behaviours mean – self-stimulation or self-regulation?
