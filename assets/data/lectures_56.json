He found fame as an actor and playwright and a musical impresario. Best known for his play “ Valley of Song” ( about two feuding Welsh choirs, which was made into a film) Cliff often found himself on the wrong side of the law, because he was a homosexual. After serving in the army with ENSA he worked almost non stop in London shows, with his own musical reviews at the famous Windmill Theatre. He also toured with Ivor Novello, and with Donald Houston ( In Dylan Thomas’ under Milk Wood) and did a good deal of work for BBC Wales, earning a high regard. He also made several feature films. After the death of Dylan Thomas in 1953, Cliff’s closest friend and confidante was Thomas’ widow, Caitlin, the two of them drunk each other under bars in London and in Italy. In the mid-late 1950s Cliff saw Shirley Bassey perform in Cardiff Bay and later invited her to tour with two of his shows, thus effectively giving Bassey her first ‘big break’ into show business. Ill- health overshadowed Cliff his whole life, in his last years he settled into marriage. A sad, brave but often amusing tale of a talented Welsh man, but born before his time who burnt the candle at both ends in pursuit of his dreams. He is hardly remembered by anyone, hence this tribute.", "additional_info": null, "duration": 120, "image_id": 2700, "added": "2018-12-05T22:44:43", "slug": "d2ef8f2b1dc87b13", "speakers": [{"id": 13766, "name": "Mr William  Cross", "slug": "mr-william-cross"}], "topics": [{"id": 4202, "name": "wales", "path": "/leisure/familyhistory/wales"}, {"id": 826, "name": "business", "path": "/business/training/business"}, {"id": 2532, "name": "business", "path": "/arts/arts/business"}, {"id": 2601, "name": "business", "path": "/arts/business/business"}], "supercategory": "leisure", "venue": {"id": 3206, "name": "Newport Branch of the Gwent Family History Society", "slug": "newport-branch-of-the-gwent-family-history-society", "city": "Newport", "postcode": "NP20 4UR"}, "organizer": {"id": 2861, "name": "William Cross, FSA Scot", "slug": "william-cross-fsa-scot"}, "date": "2019-01-30", "dates": [{"id": 16913, "from_date": "2019-01-30", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "19:00:00", "ticket_cost": "members", "ticket_info": "See Club Secretary", "additional_info": "William Cross is the author of the controversial book \" The Abergavenny Witch Hunt: An Account of the Prosecution of over twenty homosexuals in a small Welsh town in 1942.

For the first time in decades, socialism is back on the agenda—and for the first time in Labour’s history, it defines the leadership.\r\n\r\nThis book tells the story of how Corbyn’s rise was made possible by the long decline of Labour and a deep crisis in British democracy. It surveys the makeshift coalition of trade unionists, young and precarious workers, and students who rallied to Corbyn. \r\nIt shows how a novel social media campaign turned the media’s “Project Fear” on its head, making a virtue of every accusation thrown at him. And finally it asks, with all the artillery that is still ranged against Corbyn, and given the crisis-ridden Labour Party that he has inherited, what it would mean for him to succeed.\r\nReviews\r\n\r\n“Long after the Labour left was thought to be dead, Jeremy Corbyn's emergence has inspired millions. There is no one better positioned than Richard Seymour to take a look at his emergence and whether Corbyn can actually turn Labour into a force for radical change.”– Bhaskar Sunkara\r\n“Richard Seymour has a brilliant mind and a compelling style. Everything he writes is worth reading.”- Gary Younge\r\n“One of our most astute political analysts turns his attention to Corbyn, and the result is predictably essential: not just to make sense of how we got to this unlikely situation, but for his thoughts on what the left might do next” -China Miéville\r\n“Seymour is an essential voice on the left, and this book is a necessary intervention, explaining this daunting political moment and bringing the focus back to strategy. Not so much a call to arms as a call to brains.” - Laurie Penny\r\n\r\nAbout the Author\r\n\r\nRichard Seymour is a writer, broadcaster and socialist, currently based in London.

His songs include If I had a Hammer and Where Have All the Flowers Gone.  Attacked by the US government for his views on peace, unionism, civil rights and ecology, Seeger was targeted by the anti-communist witch hunt of the 1950s.  In spite of his enormous popularity, he was banned from US television for more than 17 years.  With a combination of never-before-seen archival footage and personal movies made by Seeger and his wife, the film chronicles the life of this legendary artist and political activist.  It serves as a testament to Seeger's belief in the power of song and his conviction that people can make a difference.

It is influenced by the dual lineages of Anna Halprin (California) and Suprapto Suryodarmo (Java). \r\n\r\nMy intention in this Crossing Borders session is to offer some verbal and visual images of this continually evolving practice, including some of the underlying principles of the work and my current preoccupations; opening a window onto this moving landscape at a particular moment in time and hopefully providing the ground for a fruitful and perhaps ongoing exchange between those present.\r\nFor further information, click here - http://www.independentdance.co.uk/programmepage/exchanges/crossing-borders/\r\n\r\nTickets:\r\nSingle talk £6 | £4 freelance and concession\r\n3-talk cards £16.50 | £10.50 freelance and concession\r\n\r\nDrinks Offer: Free drinks voucher for the first 20 people who book for any talk \r\n\r\nTo book, please call 020 7091 9650 or email info@independentdance.co.uk\r\n\r\nVenue:\r\nIndependent Dance\r\nSiobhan Davies Studios \r\n85 St. Georges Road\r\nLondon\r\nSE1 6ER", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 1768, "added": "2014-10-15T08:31:35", "slug": "independent-dance-crossing-borders-talks-2014", "speakers": [{"id": 15178, "name": "Helen Poynor", "slug": "helen-poynor"}], "topics": [{"id": 2676, "name": "dance", "path": "/arts/arts/education/dance"}, {"id": 1869, "name": "performance", "path": "/arts/film/videoart/performance"}, {"id": 3399, "name": "performance", "path": "/arts/art/contemporaryart/performance"}, {"id": 1018, "name": "talk", "path": "/arts/education/debate/talk"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 1781, "name": "Independent Dance", "slug": "independent-dance", "city": "London", "postcode": "SE1 6ER"}, "organizer": {"id": 1781, "name": "Independent Dance", "slug": "independent-dance"}, "date": "2014-10-21", "dates": [{"id": 14679, "from_date": "2014-10-21", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "19:00:00", "ticket_cost": "£4-£6", "ticket_info": "Please call Siobhan Davies reception on 020 7091 9650 or email info@independentdance.co.uk.", "additional_info": null, "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 1781, "name": "Independent Dance", "slug": "independent-dance", "city": "London", "postcode": "SE1 6ER"}, "organizer": {"id": 1781, "name": "Independent Dance", "slug": "independent-dance"}}]}, {"id": 14148, "title": "Meaning, Myth, Magic and Mind-Bending Medicine ", "synopsis": "What is the relationship between narrative and disease progression, and what does ayahuasca have to teach us about prescribing our own medicinal mythology?

In my own experience, undergoing a cure in the Santo Daime ayahuasca tradition for a potentially fatal leishmaniasis infection, the remedial power of ayahuasca was neither the psychedelic state nor the physiological effects of the purgative, but the freedom it offered me to reframe and rewrite the narrative I was living in. The ‘poem’ that emerged encompassed not just my illness but my whole biography; its driving meter, the clear and well signposted plot lines, and the strict rhyme scheme allowed for only one conclusion to the stanza: cure.\r\n\r\nWhat is the relationship between narrative and disease progression, and what does ayahuasca have to teach us about prescribing our own medicinal mythology? And what does all this have to do with the Lesser Key of King Solomon?\r\n\r\nDanny encountered Santo Daime while living in Japan, and followed the trail back to its source in the Amazon six years later. His background in the History and Philosophy of Medicine was thrown into perspective by a bacterial parasite which colonized a few inches of his skin, and by the cure he underwent - comprising of barks, fasts, and the multidimensional purgative ayahuasca. He lost 10 kilos, one wife and a pair of rose-tinted spectacles, but gained a wicked scar and a deep respect for the complexity and intelligence of the natural world.

After leaving school Stevyn gained places at both art and catering colleges, but turned them down and instead accepted a drunken £50 bet with his homicide detective father that he could survive six months as a police officer. He consequently joined the Metropolitan Police Service in London and ended up staying for 30 years. During his service he found himself frequently challenging the traditional or‘accepted’ ways of doing things; critical thinking and his own natural skepticism led him to explore different way of doing things, often in innovative and unusual ways. These included using wizards to tackle street gambling, lollipops to stop anti&#8208;social behaviour and dog shows to prevent homicides. Ultimately, he was asked by Scotland Yard and the Home Office to be part of an experimental unit to explore some of these new ideas, many of which have now found their way into everyday policing across the UK.\r\nThe Skeptical Bobby is all about grass&#8208;roots skepticism and why we should be critical thinkers in every aspect of our lives.\r\n‘Superb talk at QEDCon by Stevyn Colgan.

Modern politics emphasises unity and similarity, encouraging the politics of the tribe rather than of complexity. Richard Sennett argues that living with people unlike ourselves requires more than goodwill: it requires skill. The foundations for skillful co-operation lie in learning to listen well and to discuss rather than debate. People who develop these capacities earn a reward: they can take pleasure in the company of others. Sennett discusses how we can strengthen cooperation online, face-to-face in ethnic conflicts, among financial workers and community organisers. \r\n\r\nThis event marks the publication of Sennett's new book Together: The Rituals, Pleasures and Politics of Co-operation|. \r\n\r\nRichard Sennett retired in 2011 as University Professor at NYU and academic governor and Professor of Sociology at the LSE. He has won numerous international prizes, and was most recently awarded the Spinoza Prize for outstanding contributions to public debate on morality. Together forms part of a three-book project on 'homo faber', focusing on the skills human beings possess to make a life together; the first volume, The Craftsman, was published in 2008.

'Art as psychogeography' and 'psychogeography as art' possibly represent even worse prospects. The central problem here can be traced to the 'schism [in the Situationist International] of 1962, between what has been described as the artistic faction and the political faction.' (Ford, 1995). Like many artists interested in radical traditions of architecture and politics, I discovered the work of the SI and notions of 'psychogeography' early in my practice. I have subsequently addressed these issues in projects such as 'Civil Twilight' (Hunter, 2007). I have recently founded a new project entitled the 'Chapeltown Union of Psychogeographers' (C.U.P). Working with others - mainly undergraduate Fine Arts students from York St John University - C.U.P explores how the geographical environment of the Chapetlown area of Leeds influences its residents and visitors. In this presentation, I will discuss the 'schism' of art and politics, commenting on how we might understand relationships between 'forms of visibility' and 'forms of capital.' I will also provide a brief survey of artists' work engaging with psychogeography, including previous practice of my own in this respect. The main function of the presentation will be to introduce and discuss the current C.U.P project, probably coming to the conclusion that neither 'art' nor 'psychogeography' are particularly useful terms in practice and probably ought to be circumvented in future. To this end I would add 'the realization and suppression of psychogeography' to Raoul Vaneigm's call for the realization and suppression of art.'

He’s a writer, but unfortunately there are no publishers eager to sample his wares. His landlady is breathing down his neck for unpaid rent, and he is forced to try extremely uncongenial occupation to keep body and soul together: pedalling carpet cleaning lotions from door-to-door. His life, however, is about to change -- dramatically -- when he meets the seductive Suzi, and her mysterious boss, Mr Rasmussen.\r\nIn the vividness of its seedy setting and the evocation of a particular period in British history, Taylor’s highly entertaining book is more than a little reminiscent of that great chronicler of the less-than-salubrious London of this period, Patrick Hamilton. But as the nicely judged retro cover suggests, At the Chime of a City Clock is about crime and femme fatales. But it’s also about more than that, as readers will discover. The aforementioned Mr Rasmussen may well be a criminal -- and certainly his interest in the disused premises over a jeweller’s shop has sinister implications. When a member of West End Central becomes intrigued by Rasmussen's behaviour, the reluctant James Ross finds himself dragooned into keeping a close watch over Suzi's boss. And things will come to a head -- dramatically -- when James is invited to stay at an upscale country weekend in Sussex, where the revelations will come thick and fast.\r\n\r\n\r\n", "keywords": "1930s noir thriller Patrick Hamilton/James Maclaren-Ross pastiche.", "body": "\r\n Summer 1931 in seedy Bayswater and James Ross is on his uppers. An aspiring writer whose stories nobody will buy ('It's the slump'), with a landlady harassing him for unpaid rent and occasional sleepless nights spent in the waiting room at King's Cross Station, he is reduced to selling carpet-cleaning lotion door-to-door. His prospects brighten when he meets the glamorous Suzi ('the red hair and the tight jumper weren't a false card: she really was a looker and no mistake'), but their relationship turns out to be a source of increasing bafflement. Who is her boss, the mysterious Mr Rasmussen - whose face bears a startling resemblance to one of the portraits in \"Police News\" - and why is he so interested in the abandoned premises above the Cornhill jeweller's shop? Worse, mysterious Mr Haversham from West End Central is starting to take an interest in his affairs. With a brief to keep an eye on Schmiegelow, James finds himself staying incognito at a grand Society weekend at a country house in Sussex, where the truth - about Suzi and her devious employer - comes as an unexpected shock. Set against a backdrop of the 1931 financial crisis and the abandonment of the Gold Standard, acted out in shabby bed-sitters and Lyons tea-shops, \"At the Chime of a City Clock\" is an authentic slice of Thirties comedy-noir.

They are on the brink of a democratic wave similar to the one that swept through Eastern Europe more than 20 years ago, hastening the Soviet Union's collapse. The Arab intifada has put to rest the claim that Islam and Muslims are incompatible with democracy. The democratic virus is mutating and will probably give birth to a new language - and a new era - of politics in the Arab world. \r\n\r\nFawaz A. Gerges is a Professor of Middle Eastern Politics and International Relations at the London School of Economics and Political Science. He also holds the Emirates Chair of the Contemporary Middle East and is the Director of the Middle East Centre at LSE. \r\n\r\nHe earned a doctorate from Oxford University and M.Sc. from the London School of Economics and Political Science. Gerges has taught at Oxford, Harvard, and Columbia, and was a research scholar at Princeton and was a chairholder (the Christian A. Johnson Chair in Middle Eastern Studies and International Affairs) at Sarah Lawrence College, New York. \r\n\r\nHis special interests include Islam and the political process, social movements, including mainstream Islamist movements and jihadist groups (like the Muslim Brotherhood and Al Qaeda), Arab politics and Muslim politics in the 20th century, the international relations of the Middle East, the Arab-Israeli conflict, state and society in the Middle East, American foreign policy towards the Muslim world, the modern history of the Middle East, history of conflict, diplomacy and foreign policy, and historical sociology. \r\n\r\nGerges is author of two recently acclaimed books: Journey of the Jihadist: Inside Muslim Militancy (Harcourt Press, 2007), and The Far Enemy: Why Jihad Went Global (Cambridge University Press, 2005). The Washington Post selected The Far Enemy as one of the best 15 books published in the field. Journey of the Jihadist was on the best-selling list of Barnes and Nobles and Foreign Affairs Magazine for several months. \r\n\r\nHe is writing two books tentatively titled The Rise and Fall of Al Qaeda: What American and Western Politicians Don't Want You to Know? (Oxford University Press, 2011) and Obama and the Greater Middle East: Rhetoric versus Reality (Palgrave Macmillan, 2011). \r\n\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 732, "added": "2011-02-08T20:20:21", "slug": "df0aff00dfadee8e", "speakers": [{"id": 9093, "name": "Professor  Fawaz  Gerges", "slug": "professor-fawaz-gerges"}], "topics": [{"id": 914, "name": "international", "path": "/society/culturalidentity/international"}, {"id": 1441, "name": "international", "path": "/society/law/international"}, {"id": 527, "name": "politics", "path": "/politics/local/politics"}, {"id": 538, "name": "politics", "path": "/arts/photography/politics"}, {"id": 2429, "name": "middleeast", "path": "/academic/internationalrelations/middleeast"}], "supercategory": "society", "venue": {"id": 2113, "name": "Sheikh Zayed Theatre", "slug": "sheikh-zayed-theatre", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC2A 2AE"}, "organizer": {"id": 1287, "name": "London School of Economics & Political Science", "slug": "london-school-of-economics-political-science"}, "date": "2011-02-24", "dates": [{"id": 9827, "from_date": "2011-02-24", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "18:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": "This event is free and open to all with no ticket required.

Today almost £500m worth of goods bearing the Fairtrade mark are sold annually, including tea, coffee, bananas, cotton, flowers and even footballs. At the heart of this revolution in our shops is the Fairtrade Foundation, which was established in 1992 by CAFOD, Christian Aid, New Consumer, Oxfam, Traidcraft Exchange and the World Development Movement. Starting small but with big ideas, it has turned a grass-roots movement into a phenomenon of our time – changing not only the way in which corporations deal with their suppliers and how consumers shop on the high street, but also transforming the lives of over 7 million farmers, workers and their families. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fairtrade Foundation is all about creating a better deal for workers and famers in the developing world. At its heart it aims to make sure the food on our plates, and shirts on our backs, don't rob people in other countries of the means to feed or clothe themselves. In this lecture Harriet Lamb will discuss her latest book, Fighting the Banana Wars, in which she travels through an often unjust system to uncover the shocking cost of our demand for cheaper produce. \r\n\r\nHarriet Lamb has been executive director of the Fairtrade Foundation since 2001. She has guided the Foundation through a period of staggering growth, which has seen estimated sales of Fairtrade products in the UK increase from £30m to more than £493m in 2007 with more than 4500 products carrying the FAIRTRADE Mark. \r\n\r\nA flourishing grassroots social movement has grown across the UK. There are more than 300 Fairtrade Towns – towns where a commitment to Fairtrade has been made by the council, shops and businesses – together with 50 Fairtrade universities and 4,000 Fairtrade Faith Groups, including Mosques. Harriet was awarded a CBE in the New Year’s Honours List 2006.  In 2007 she was voted the second most influential eco foodie in the UK after Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall in the Observer Food Monthly magazine. \r\n\r\nAdam Brett is a Fairtrade entrepreneur, director of Tropical Wholefoods and Fullwell Mill Ltd.

Each lecture focuses on the work of one key artist, whose practice may be understood as a foundation for the development of contemporary art and culture.\r\n\r\nThe series brings together a broad scope of experts, all of whom have made lasting contributions to the contemporary art world and are an authority in their field. The speakers include professors at renowned universities, pioneers of art education, and leading institutional directors. Witte de With asked each speaker to choose as a point of departure an artist who has had an influence on their own academic practice. They will therefore share their fascination with this work, sometimes illustrated by personal anecdotes and experiences. Many of the speakers have worked closely with their chosen artist throughout their careers, enabling them to give a unique twist to existing art historical accounts. \r\n\r\nThe Cornerstones lectures do not only reflect upon recent art historical developments, but also offer an insight into the contemporary art world by means of art historical analysis. Through this series, Witte de With bridges art’s theory and practice, bringing together both intellectual and intuitive approaches. Cornerstones is aimed at a public with a broad interest in art and culture, as much as at arts students and professionals. Illustrated with striking images, the lectures also provide a point of access for an audience less familiar with recent art history. \r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 1093, "added": "2008-12-05T02:33:01", "slug": "ina-blom-on-lynda-benglis", "speakers": [{"id": 7752, "name": "Ina Blom", "slug": "ina-blom"}], "topics": [{"id": 1332, "name": "contemporary", "path": "/arts/photography/contemporary"}, {"id": 1073, "name": "contemporary", "path": "/arts/curating/contemporary"}, {"id": 612, "name": "contemporary", "path": "/arts/books/poetry/french/contemporary"}, {"id": 608, "name": "contemporary", "path": "/arts/literature/francophone/poetry/contemporary"}, {"id": 1701, "name": "sculpture", "path": "/arts/art/contemporaryart/sculpture"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 1843, "name": "Witte de With", "slug": "witte-de-with", "city": "Rotterdam", "postcode": "301 2BR"}, "organizer": {"id": 1843, "name": "Witte de With", "slug": "witte-de-with"}, "date": "2009-01-29", "dates": [{"id": 6474, "from_date": "2009-01-29", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "19:00:00", "ticket_cost": "€10,- (reduced price €7,-)", "ticket_info": "reservations@wdw.nl", "additional_info": "Prior to every Cornerstones lecture, Witte de With’s exhibition will remain open between 6 p.m. and 7 p.m. \r\n\r\n", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 1843, "name": "Witte de With", "slug": "witte-de-with", "city": "Rotterdam", "postcode": "301 2BR"}, "organizer": {"id": 1843, "name": "Witte de With", "slug": "witte-de-with"}}]}, {"id": 6115, "title": "PhotoVoice Lecture Series", "synopsis": "Nadav Kander\r\nIn discussion with Joanna Pitman (The Times)", "keywords": "Nadav Kander Photography Visual Art China ", "body": "Widely recognised as one of the world’s leading photographers, Nadav Kander will be in discussion with Joanna Pitman, giving his audience an insight into his inspirations and experiences, and showcasing his latest project: Yangtze, The Long River.\r\n\r\nThe lecture will be accompanied by an exhibition of photographs taken by marginalised and vulnerable groups from around the world, trained in photojournalism by the award winning international charity, PhotoVoice.\r\n\r\nThe proceeds from the Lecture Series will go towards PhotoVoice’s groundbreaking work.\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 120, "image_id": null, "added": "2008-11-12T07:44:13", "slug": "c2cd5d1b95e64d20", "speakers": [{"id": 7683, "name": "Photographer Nadav Kander", "slug": "photographer-nadav-kander"}], "topics": [{"id": 1574, "name": "photography", "path": "/society/media/media/photography"}], "supercategory": "society", "venue": {"id": 494, "name": "Royal Geographical Society", "slug": "royal-geographical-society", "city": "London", "postcode": "SW7 2AR"}, "organizer": {"id": 1254, "name": "PhotoVoice", "slug": "photovoice"}, "date": "2008-11-18", "dates": [{"id": 6416, "from_date": "2008-11-18", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "19:00:00", "ticket_cost": "£10 in advance / £15 on the door.", "ticket_info": "Call 020 7033 3878 or visit www.photovoice.org", "additional_info": null, "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 494, "name": "Royal Geographical Society", "slug": "royal-geographical-society", "city": "London", "postcode": "SW7 2AR"}, "organizer": {"id": 1254, "name": "PhotoVoice", "slug": "photovoice"}}]}, {"id": 6015, "title": "Study Day  \"Spotlight on Skeptics - Some Perspectives on Psi-Denial\"", "synopsis": "All day meeting with lectures from eminent speakers in the field of Psychical Research offering answers to the criticisms of skeptics.", "keywords": "Psychic, Research, Skeptic, Paranormal, Psychology, Parapsychology", "body": "From the earliest days sychical researchers, some of them experienced investigators adn experiments, some with expertise in related disciplines, some just apparently honest people who have reported inciedents personally witnessed by them, all hasve had to encurfe some ill-informed and hostile attacks from critics who often seem perpared to say anything, however insecurely based, to discredit findings that favour the reality of paranormal phenomena.

Indeed, Enoch Powell, sometimes called ‘the father of social care’ likened these hospitals to prisons preventing patients from returning to a normal life. Could asylums be the worst idea on the mind? A common treatment used in such institutions was electroconvulsive therapy.

But what can we do about it?\r\n\r\nOn the 24th September the &#8220;Medicine and its History Day School&#8221; at the Thackray Museum will tackle the issues related to obesity head on. The day will begin with a talk by nutritionist Nilani Sritharan who will give us an overview of &#8220;the BIG issue&#8221; and the factors that have led to the current obesity levels. \r\n\r\nWhile many try and analyse the causes of the rising obesity statistics the vast majority of researchers point to the sedentary lifestyles of children, the advertising budgets of the &#8220;junk food&#8221; industry, poor nutritional knowledge and a lack of basic cooking skills. Professor Paul Gately of Leeds Metropolitan University took pioneering steps to confront these issues and established the first Weight Management Camp in Europe.  Professor Gately will talk about why he established the camp, and how successful it has been.\r\n\r\nSo, what do you do when you can&#8217;t face a life at the gym and a fridge full of salad? \r\nSome people resort to surgery and through history many methods have been adopted with varying levels of success. Mr Stephen Pollard from St James&#8217;s Hospital will look at some of the operations that surgeons have used to help, from the small bowel bypass (where a section of the small intestine is re-routed, so there is a smaller surface area to absorb the calories) to operations where the excess skin is removed after a large weight loss. For those who may see surgery as a &#8220;quick fix&#8221; Mr Pollard will also talk about the negative consequences of some of these operations.\r\n\r\nProfessor Peter Kopelman chairs the Royal College of Physicians Committee on the management of Obesity and to end the day he will report on the national position and how society can tackle the issues. Jamie Oliver has probably been the most iconic person fighting obesity in recent times, but will his school meals campaign transform the habits of a nation? Should the government fund places at Weight Management Camps if it can potentially save NHS resources? These questions are addressed at a national level by Professor Kopelman and he will talk about some of the solutions the government is considering.\r\n\r\nThe Medicine and its History Day School is aimed at the general public as well as people in the medical professions and costs £23.50.

Humans can feel empathy for other people in a wide array of contexts: for basic emotions and sensation such as anger, fear, sadness, joy, pain and lust as well as for more complex emotions such as guilt, embarrassment and love. Although empathy seems to be an automatic response of the brain to others’ emotional reactions, there are circumstances under which we do not share the same feeling as others. Imagine, for example, that someone who does the same job as you is paid twice as much. In this case, that person might be very satisfied with their extra salary, but you would not share this satisfaction. You would consider the situation unfair. The notion of fairness is not only crucial in personal interaction with others in the context of families, workplace or interactions with strangers but also guides people’s behaviour in impersonal economic and political domains when it comes to the perceived fairness of a firm’s policy and a state’s justice. Speakers at this meeting will describe various aspects of current research on empathy and fairness in animals and humans, including our understanding of the underlying neurophysiology of these processes.
