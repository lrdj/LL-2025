The process of finding names for their Romani varieties more specifically – and more ‘accurately’ and ‘formally’ – opened up new and unexpected situations. The research team’s firm and clearly acknowledged starting point had included a recognition that language names are never politically innocent or neutral, and the names of languages and linguistic varieties have always been dependent on who is doing the naming, and for what purpose, and whose purpose, and whether the naming is done by an insider or an outsider, from an emic (insider) or an etic (outsider)  perspective (Headland et al, 1991).\r\n\r\nIt is language names and naming practices that are excavated here in an on-going quest for developing more socially just methodologies. In the case of Roma people and with reference to their various Romani language names, they are a source of information of the Roma past and the various Roma groups’ routes of migration (Matras, 2005), and of social exclusion and marginalisation (Danaher, 2013; Fleck and Rughinis, 2008). Importantly, they also reveal Roma people’s agency and attempts to resist marginalisation (Danaher, 2013). One of the key findings concerned the participants’ investigation of both emic and etic naming practices of their own language – switching from emic to etic – which promoted emancipation.\r\n\r\nBIO\r\nLeenaRobertson\r\n\r\nLeena Robertson is Associate Professor in the department of Education at Middlesex University, London.

Under the Nazi regime, secretaries, SS-Helferinnen (female auxiliaries for the SS) and Nachrichtenhelferinnen des Heeres (female auxiliaries for the army) held similar jobs: taking dictation, answering telephones, sending telegrams. Yet their backgrounds and degree of commitment to Nazi ideology differed markedly. Century explores their motivations and what they knew about the true nature of their work. These women had access to information about the administration of the Holocaust and are a relatively untapped resource. Their recollections shed light on the lives, love lives, and work of their superiors, and the tasks that contributed to the displacement, deportation and death of millions. The question of how gender intersected with Nazism, repression, atrocity and genocide forms the conceptual thread of this book.\r\n\r\nDr Rachel Century is the HMD Development Manager for the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust. She completed her doctorate in Holocaust Studies at Royal Holloway, University of London, specifically focusing on the female administrative workers of the Third Reich.

Would not the role of philosophy under such circumstances be to lead us to a completer [sic] perception of reality by means of a certain displacement of our attention? It would be a question of turning this attention aside from the part of the universe which interests us from a practical viewpoint and turning it back toward what serves no practical purpose. This conversion of the attention would be philosophy itself.\" (Henri Bergson)\r\n\r\n\"The average person checks their phone nine times an hour.\" (International Digital Times, October 2013)\r\n\r\nWith Franco “Bifo” Berardi’s notion of attention as under siege in the back of my mind, in this talk I will share work-in-progress thinking on the concept of attention as it figures in the work of Henri Bergson and his sister Moina Mathers, Jonathan Crary, Allan Kaprow and others.\r\n \r\nWhat is attention? Can performance and philosophy (or indeed, performance philosophy) produce ‘counter-forms of attention’ (Crary) or operate as an ‘education of attention’ (Bergson) in the context of the contemporary attention economy? And if so, what forms might these counter practices take? While Bifo writes of resistance in terms of ‘the self-organisation of cognitive work’ and ‘the global mind’, we will be working towards a notion of ‘thought’ as neither exclusively the province of the mind nor of philosophy (as a metaphysical kind of vision or knowledge), but an embodied perceptual practice available to all.\r\n\r\nAbout Laura...\r\n\r\nLaura Cull is senior lecturer in theatre studies and director of postgraduate research for the School of Arts at the University of Surrey, UK.

This special presentation by Dr Gábor Kádár, organised by the Wiener Library to mark Yom Hashoah 2014 and the 70th anniversary of the mass deportation of Hungarian Jews to Auschwitz, will attempt to answer these questions.\r\n\r\nDr Kádár has been conducting historical research and has been participating in digital humanities projects for 15 years.", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": null, "added": "2014-04-03T14:56:32", "slug": "89098f907ead8b29", "speakers": [{"id": 14621, "name": "Dr Gábor Kádár", "slug": "dr-gábor-kádár"}], "topics": [{"id": 2692, "name": "history", "path": "/arts/finearts/film/film/history"}, {"id": 106, "name": "wwi", "path": "/arts/books/history/military/wwi"}, {"id": 107, "name": "wwii", "path": "/arts/books/history/military/wwii"}, {"id": 108, "name": "army", "path": "/arts/books/history/military/army"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 1886, "name": "The Wiener Library for the Study of the Holocaust and Genocide", "slug": "the-wiener-library-for-the-study-of-the-holocaust-and-genocide", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC1B 5DP"}, "organizer": {"id": 1886, "name": "The Wiener Library for the Study of the Holocaust and Genocide", "slug": "the-wiener-library-for-the-study-of-the-holocaust-and-genocide"}, "date": "2014-04-24", "dates": [{"id": 14086, "from_date": "2014-04-24", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "18:30:00", "ticket_cost": "This event is free but places are limited and therefore booking is essential.", "ticket_info": "http://www.wienerlibrary.co.uk/Whats-On?item=129", "additional_info": null, "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 1886, "name": "The Wiener Library for the Study of the Holocaust and Genocide", "slug": "the-wiener-library-for-the-study-of-the-holocaust-and-genocide", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC1B 5DP"}, "organizer": {"id": 1886, "name": "The Wiener Library for the Study of the Holocaust and Genocide", "slug": "the-wiener-library-for-the-study-of-the-holocaust-and-genocide"}}]}, {"id": 13459, "title": "The Life and Secrets of Almina Carnarvon", "synopsis": "A dip into the scandalous life and times of Almina, 5th Countess of Carnarvon, of Tutankhamun fame, and Downton Abbey, wife of the man who discovered the famous buried treasures of the Boy King  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "keywords": "Almina Carnarvon, Highclere Castle, Downton Abbey, William Cross, FSA Scot, Life and Secrets, Tutankhamun, Countess of Carnarvon", "body": "The biographer of overlooked British aristocrats William Cross, FSA Scot, dips into the life and times of Almina, 5th Countess of Carnarvon, of Tutankhamun fame\r\n\r\nThe illustrated talk is based on Will's best selling biography \"The Life and Secrets of of Almina Carnarvon\", published in 2011.

As a result, its theology, its metaphysics and its  psychology are difficult for the modern thinker to understand or accept, other than in a very limited way. \r\nThis talk, and its accompanying question and answer session, will attempt to challenge many of the assumptions which act as a barrier to a wider and deeper appreciation of the beautiful truths of Platonism, and will  offer a radical revision of our view of ourselves, our universe, its  source, and the various relationships involved.\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 60, "image_id": null, "added": "2012-10-29T19:06:21", "slug": "7e2e2a6029270bae", "speakers": [{"id": 3573, "name": "  Tim Addey", "slug": "tim-addey"}], "topics": [{"id": 1822, "name": "philosophy", "path": "/academic/religion/religion/philosophy"}, {"id": 2388, "name": "philosophy", "path": "/arts/literature/philosophy/philosophy"}, {"id": 365, "name": "platonism", "path": "/arts/philosophy/platonism"}, {"id": 2080, "name": "spiritual", "path": "/academic/philosophy/spiritual"}], "supercategory": "academic", "venue": {"id": 762, "name": "New Acropolis", "slug": "new-acropolis", "city": "London", "postcode": "N1 2UN"}, "organizer": {"id": 2041, "name": "The Prometheus Trust", "slug": "the-prometheus-trust"}, "date": "2012-11-22", "dates": [{"id": 12221, "from_date": "2012-11-22", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "19:30:00", "ticket_cost": "£5 (£3 concessions)", "ticket_info": "The Administrator, The Prometheus Trust, info@prometheustrust.co.uk or phone 01373 825808.

In January 2000, Entwicklung und Zusammenarbeit, the German development magazine, described Mr de Soto as one of the most important development theoreticians of the last millennium. In October 2005, over 20,000 readers of Prospect magazine of the UK and Foreign Policy of the US ranked him among the top 13 \"public intellectuals\" in the world from the magazines' joint list of 100. \r\n\r\nMr de Soto has served as an economist for the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, as President of the Executive Committee of the Copper Exporting Countries Organization (CIPEC), as CEO of Universal Engineering Corporation (Continental Europe's largest consulting engineering firm), as a principal of the Swiss Bank Corporation Consultant Group, and as a governor of Peru's Central Reserve Bank. \r\n\r\nCurrently, Mr de Soto, together with his colleagues at the ILD, is focused on designing and implementing capital formation programs to empower the poor in Africa, Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, and former Soviet Nations.

Curricular and pedagogical reforms in the last 15 years have aimed to give more scope for children to develop both their individual strengths, while deepening their ability to relate to others. In this talk, based on ethnographic research at Japanese primary schools between 1994 and 2004, Peter Cave argues that the best Japanese primary teaching uses a dialogical approach that enables children to learn from one another, as well as from the teacher, in a ‘community of inquiry’.

This is your chance to see the chemistry laboratories used to isolate and identify active molecules in medicinal plants, the molecular labs where scientists bring plants for DNA fingerprinting, and the anatomy labs that are used to assist with forensic enquiries involving toxic plants.

In addition, there are two workshops on professional and academic media through the direction of lecturers and practitioners from the University of Manchester, the BBC, and the Manchester University Press. This will prove invaluable for individuals interested in gaining media experience, improving career profiles and employment opportunities, and knowing more about routes into the media sector. \r\n\r\nFinally, a panel session of esteemed academics, professionals and MPs will provide an opportunity for dialogue in the field of media, during which we will consider mis/representations of reality within media, questioning whether media represents reality, or creates only a representation of reality?", "additional_info": null, "duration": 480, "image_id": null, "added": "2004-05-28T10:21:44", "slug": "misrepresentation-in-media-conference-17-18-june", "speakers": [{"id": 904, "name": "Professor John Corner", "slug": "professor-john-corner"}, {"id": 905, "name": "Mr Johann Harri", "slug": "mr-johann-harri"}, {"id": 906, "name": "Rt Hon Tony Lloyd", "slug": "rt-hon-tony-lloyd"}, {"id": 907, "name": "Dr Gareth Palmer", "slug": "dr-gareth-palmer"}, {"id": 908, "name": "Dr Stuart Price", "slug": "dr-stuart-price"}, {"id": 909, "name": "Dr Conrad Leyser", "slug": "dr-conrad-leyser"}], "topics": [{"id": 391, "name": "society", "path": "/arts/society"}, {"id": 256, "name": "history", "path": "/arts/history"}, {"id": 390, "name": "media", "path": "/arts/media"}, {"id": 389, "name": "politics", "path": "/arts/politics"}, {"id": 201, "name": "media", "path": "/society/media"}, {"id": 211, "name": "history", "path": "/society/history"}, {"id": 369, "name": "politics", "path": "/society/politics"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 296, "name": "Mis/Representation in Media", "slug": "misrepresentation-in-media", "city": "Manchester", "postcode": "M13 9PL"}, "organizer": {"id": 296, "name": "Mis/Representation in Media", "slug": "misrepresentation-in-media"}, "date": "2004-06-17", "dates": [{"id": 700, "from_date": "2004-06-17", "to_date": "2004-06-17", "time": "9:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": "An on-line registration form is available on the website. \"http://les1.man.ac.uk/graduateschool/mediaconference/\":http://les1.man.ac.uk/graduateschool/mediaconference/", "additional_info": "This event is being held in the Williamson building (3rd floor) off Oxford Road at the University of Manchester.

In the 18th century, a well-furnished house in either the town or the country was essential. It was a sign of the owner’s social status and taste. In the 18th century ‘at homes’ were a new, fashionable form of domestic entertainment. Small groups of invited guests would arrive at intervals throughout the late morning and afternoon for tea and polite conversation. More people began to turn their attention towards the domestic interior, the way in which rooms were decorated, furnished and used. This course will use the V&A’s collections, contemporary literature and paintings to gain insight into the 18th century domestic interior within their social contexts.\r\n\r\n‘At Home’ in Town and Country: 18th Century Domestic Interiors has been developed with Birkbeck Faculty of Continuing Education,  University London. It is aimed at adults without specialist knowledge of the subjects covered and is open to anyone with an interest and enthusiasm for study. \r\n\r\nThe course is taught by a combination of lectures, seminars, group discussion and gallery visits. Students will be encouraged submit some written work or complete a self-assessment report on their achievements. Students completing the coursework may submit this as part of the Birkbeck Certificate in General Studies.\r\n\r\n Course taught by Dr Karen Lipsedge.\r\n\r\nTickets: Full rate: £70.00.
