He found fame as an actor and playwright and a musical impresario. Best known for his play “ Valley of Song” ( about two feuding Welsh choirs, which was made into a film) Cliff often found himself on the wrong side of the law, because he was a homosexual. After serving in the army with ENSA he worked almost non stop in London shows, with his own musical reviews at the famous Windmill Theatre. He also toured with Ivor Novello, and with Donald Houston ( In Dylan Thomas’ under Milk Wood) and did a good deal of work for BBC Wales, earning a high regard. He also made several feature films. After the death of Dylan Thomas in 1953, Cliff’s closest friend and confidante was Thomas’ widow, Caitlin, the two of them drunk each other under bars in London and in Italy. In the mid-late 1950s Cliff saw Shirley Bassey perform in Cardiff Bay and later invited her to tour with two of his shows, thus effectively giving Bassey her first ‘big break’ into show business. Ill- health overshadowed Cliff his whole life, in his last years he settled into marriage. A sad, brave but often amusing tale of a talented Welsh man, but born before his time who burnt the candle at both ends in pursuit of his dreams. He is hardly remembered by anyone, hence this tribute.", "additional_info": null, "duration": 120, "image_id": 2700, "added": "2018-06-19T23:05:26", "slug": "3053c4e9b3be74d3", "speakers": [{"id": 13766, "name": "Mr William  Cross", "slug": "mr-william-cross"}], "topics": [{"id": 4202, "name": "wales", "path": "/leisure/familyhistory/wales"}, {"id": 2169, "name": "comedy", "path": "/society/media/comedy"}, {"id": 2902, "name": "comedy", "path": "/arts/comedy/comedy"}, {"id": 4385, "name": "comedy", "path": "/leisure/entertainment/comedy"}], "supercategory": "leisure", "venue": {"id": 3214, "name": "Newbridge U3A", "slug": "newbridge-u3a", "city": "Newbridge, South Wales", "postcode": "NP11 5PE"}, "organizer": {"id": 2861, "name": "William Cross, FSA Scot", "slug": "william-cross-fsa-scot"}, "date": "2018-07-24", "dates": [{"id": 16758, "from_date": "2018-07-24", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "14:00:00", "ticket_cost": "Members and Guests", "ticket_info": "See Club Secretary", "additional_info": "William Cross is the author of the controversial book \" The Abergavenny Witch Hunt: An Account of the Prosecution of over twenty homosexuals in a small Welsh town in 1942.

As we know, Karski’s mission was hardly successful, which left the Polish hero with an enduring sense of guilt and failure. Another attempt to rally support for the causes Karski championed was his bestselling book, Story of the Secret State (1944). Yet, like his diplomatic mission, his memoirs achieved little in practical terms. Karski’s engagement with the Jewish cause was officially acknowledged in 1982 when he was recognized by Yad Vashem as Righteous Among the Nations, and when in 1994 he was made an honorary citizen of Israel. Then, in 2002 a statue of Jan Karski was unveiled in Washington and in 2012 Barack Obama posthumously awarded the Polish courier the Presidential Medal for Freedom. It is also in order to honour Karski’s courage and moral integrity that in 2009 French writer Yannick Haenel published a novel celebrating the Polish hero’s commitment to saving Europe’s Jews. At first favourably received, Jan Karski then caused a storm in the French media where the book was attacked by, amongst other, eminent figures such as Claude Lanzmann and Annette Wieviorka; the critics reproached Haenel for having distorted historical reality and misrepresented Karski himself. It is the aim of this presentation to shed some light on the heated debate surrounding Haenel’s controversial take on Karski’s story and, if possible, to evaluate the French writer’s contribution to preserving the legacy of the Polish resister and, more broadly, the memory of Holocaust victims.\r\n\r\nSpeaker:\r\n\r\nDr Helena Duffy is a Marie Sk&#322;odowska–Curie Research Fellow at Royal Holloway, University of London, where she is affiliated to the Holocaust Research Institute. She is working with Prof. Robert Eaglestone on an EU–funded project concerned with French Holocaust fiction. She is particularly interested in the interplay between the thematics and postmodern aesthetics of contemporary literature dealing with the Occupation of France and the Shoah, and with the potential ethical implications of this literature for Holocaust memory.\r\n\r\nPlease note that the talk by Dr Helena Duffy will commence at 6:30pm.", "additional_info": null, "duration": 120, "image_id": null, "added": "2017-02-02T10:30:09", "slug": "480ebfe51655eeee", "speakers": [{"id": 16473, "name": "Dr Helena Duffy", "slug": "dr-helena-duffy"}], "topics": [{"id": 107, "name": "wwii", "path": "/arts/books/history/military/wwii"}, {"id": 2692, "name": "history", "path": "/arts/finearts/film/film/history"}, {"id": 106, "name": "wwi", "path": "/arts/books/history/military/wwi"}, {"id": 108, "name": "army", "path": "/arts/books/history/military/army"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 1886, "name": "The Wiener Library for the Study of the Holocaust and Genocide", "slug": "the-wiener-library-for-the-study-of-the-holocaust-and-genocide", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC1B 5DP"}, "organizer": {"id": 1886, "name": "The Wiener Library for the Study of the Holocaust and Genocide", "slug": "the-wiener-library-for-the-study-of-the-holocaust-and-genocide"}, "date": "2017-03-23", "dates": [{"id": 16309, "from_date": "2017-03-23", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "18:00:00", "ticket_cost": "Admission is free, but booking is essential as space is limited", "ticket_info": "http://www.wienerlibrary.co.uk", "additional_info": null, "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 1886, "name": "The Wiener Library for the Study of the Holocaust and Genocide", "slug": "the-wiener-library-for-the-study-of-the-holocaust-and-genocide", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC1B 5DP"}, "organizer": {"id": 1886, "name": "The Wiener Library for the Study of the Holocaust and Genocide", "slug": "the-wiener-library-for-the-study-of-the-holocaust-and-genocide"}}]}, {"id": 4750, "title": "Family History Research Skills - Stage 2 - evening classes", "synopsis": "Stage 2 of the Society of Genealogists' highly successful Family History Research Skills evening classes begins in April.

Can structures that shape our understanding of music be gleaned from sonic information? Can music knowledge be formalized and represented mathematically? We shall consider these questions in the context of performance, the primary means by which music is communicated to the listener. \r\n      An important function of performance is the use of prosodic variation to communicate an understanding of music structure, broadly defined as the product of musical sense making. Music structure is more than simply sonata form or ABA structure. It refers to all manner of musical coherence as generated by surface features and deeper ones, musical entities and boundaries, movements and arrivals. Multiple plausible structural solutions almost always exist. The structure experienced is subject to the vicissitudes of individual perception, that of the performer and that of the listener. The performance thus shapes the listener's experience of the music and, in particular, the listener's perception of the music's structure and meaning.\r\n      What then are the hallmarks of a successful performance? While many have likened music composition to mathematical proof because of its pursuit of \"unexpectedness, combined with inevitability and economy\" (Hardy 1940), few have openly acknowledged the premium that performance places on these same qualities. We shall consider the problem of musical sense making, and how successful designations of structural solutions—from local weighting of anchor tones to melodic segmentations to placements of tipping points—manifest properties of surprise, inevitability, and parsimony.\r\n      \r\nThe lecture will include performances at the piano and visualisations of music structure.\r\n\r\nThe lecture will be followed by a free drinks reception. \r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 60, "image_id": 2572, "added": "2016-09-02T09:25:21", "slug": "16267a3873356c25", "speakers": [{"id": 16294, "name": "Professor Elaine Chew", "slug": "professor-elaine-chew"}], "topics": [{"id": 170, "name": "newtopic", "path": "/science/chemistry/biochemistry/catalysis/newtopic"}, {"id": 2576, "name": "digital", "path": "/academic/law/criminaljustice/digital"}, {"id": 778, "name": "engineering", "path": "/science/engineering/engineering/engineering"}, {"id": 1395, "name": "engineering", "path": "/academic/science/philosophy/engineering"}], "supercategory": "science", "venue": {"id": 2936, "name": "Arts Two Lecture Theatre", "slug": "arts-two-lecture-theatre", "city": "London", "postcode": "E1 4NS"}, "organizer": {"id": 3213, "name": "Events Office, Queen Mary University of London", "slug": "events-office-queen-mary-university-of-london"}, "date": "2016-10-11", "dates": [{"id": 16081, "from_date": "2016-10-11", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "19:00:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": "https://musicmathematics.eventbrite.co.uk", "additional_info": "For further information contact: b.prescott@qmul.ac.uk or visit http://www.qmul.ac.uk/events/meetprofessors/\r\n", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 2936, "name": "Arts Two Lecture Theatre", "slug": "arts-two-lecture-theatre", "city": "London", "postcode": "E1 4NS"}, "organizer": {"id": 3213, "name": "Events Office, Queen Mary University of London", "slug": "events-office-queen-mary-university-of-london"}}]}, {"id": 15519, "title": "The Future of Artificial Intelligence", "synopsis": "Artificial intelligence is attracting a lot of attention both from industry and from the media.

Far from being a factual or historical portrait of the four women, Possible and Imaginary Lives is attempted to convey the eccentricities and the imagination of these women so as to give their imaginings the same status as reality. In her talk, Yasmine Eid-Sabbagh reflects upon ways of gathering, sifting, listening to and making stories and words emerge, to recreate semi-fictional stories and words in the present in the most vivid possible way. Yasmine Eid-Sabbagh studied history, photography and visual anthropology in Paris. From 2006 to 2011, she lived in Burj al-Shamali, a refugee camp next to Tyr, Lebanon, where she carried out photographic research, including a dialogical project with young Palestinian refugees and archival work on family and studio photographs. Since 2008, Eid-Sabbagh is a member of the Arab Image Foundation. She is currently a doctoral candidate at the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna.

When the White House invoked executive privilege, legislators and citizens were remarkably determined in challenging it, and historians were unusually effective in exposing the self-interest hidden by official secrecy. More recent invocations of national security therefore stand in sharp contrast with America’s founders and their principles.\r\n\r\nProfessor Matthew Connelly is Philippe Roman Chair in History and International Affairs at LSE IDEAS for 2014-2015. Currently a professor in the Department of History at Columbia University, Matthew Connelly is also founder and director or the LSE-Columbia University Double Degree in International and World History. His current research focuses on planning and predictions, and using data science to analyse patterns in official secrecy. He received his B.A. from Columbia and his Ph.D. from Yale He has authored a wide-range of articles and publications, including the award-winning 'Diplomatic Revolution: Algeria’s fight for independence and the origins of the post-Cold War era', which has won five prizes since its publication. His most recent book, 'Fatal Misconception: the struggle to control world population', was chosen as one of the best books of the year by 'The Economist' and the 'Financial Times'.\r\n\r\nProfessor Arne Westad (@OAWestad) is the director of LSE IDEAS.\r\n\r\nSuggested hashtag for this event for Twitter users: #LSEConnelly", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 732, "added": "2014-08-26T21:23:45", "slug": "e0792a3e78b54e72", "speakers": [{"id": 14960, "name": "Professor Matthew  Connelly", "slug": "professor-matthew-connelly"}], "topics": [{"id": 3115, "name": "america", "path": "/business/economy/crisis/europe/america"}, {"id": 1741, "name": "america", "path": "/arts/history/worldhistory/america"}, {"id": 1243, "name": "america", "path": "/politics/history/america"}], "supercategory": "business", "venue": {"id": 1515, "name": "Old Theatre, Old Building", "slug": "old-theatre-old-building", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC2A 2AE"}, "organizer": {"id": 1287, "name": "London School of Economics & Political Science", "slug": "london-school-of-economics-political-science"}, "date": "2014-10-21", "dates": [{"id": 14484, "from_date": "2014-10-21", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "18:30:00", "ticket_cost": "FREE", "ticket_info": "This event is free and open to all with no ticket or pre-registration required.

On the 50th anniversary of their sentencing, LSE hosts its official commemorative event to honour the life of Nelson Mandela. Eminent contemporaries and leading scholars of the late President of South Africa reflect on the role of law in the struggle against apartheid - and on Mandela, the lawyer. Against the dramatic backdrop of one of the most iconic trials of the twentieth century, the distinguished panellists discuss Nelson Mandela’s personal commitment to the idea of law, the role of law in the making and breaking of apartheid, and the courtroom as a stage for freedom’s greatest orator. Unbeknownst to many, Mr Mandela cared deeply about his first vocation.

While postcolonial states of South Asia and the Middle East are heir to this arrangement, they are also distinct in that they retain religious laws for the regulation of family affairs. As a result, both minority and majority religious communities of these postcolonial polities continue to exert a fair degree of judicial autonomy over family affairs based on their religious traditions.

Such a question leads us to ask why students have to take so many GCSEs, English language exams, A levels, vocational assessments and so on. This seminar seeks to describe the part that examinations play in modern societies. Are they part of a widespread system of rules and regulations which constrain individuals? Or are they a route to new opportunities which lead to growth and self-fulfillment? Those who are working in the field of assessment might see themselves as trying to balance the tensions which pull in each of these directions. This seminar will be an opportunity to address such issues in the light of current discussions about educational assessment. \r\n\r\nThis seminar is part of the Assessment Principles series of seminars presented by Andrew Watts, a Principal Consultant for the Cambridge Assessment Network Division. The series focuses on five key topics in assessment: the purposes of assessment; the relationship between assessment and learning; the development of assessments; the validity and the reliability of assessments. Each session addresses one of these topics. Though the topics are the same each year, up-to-date issues are discussed which focus on recent news stories or which represent the latest thinking in that area. The series is for those who want to take a broad view of the field of educational assessment, in company with others working in the field. Participants will be able to share their own experiences and perceptions, and to reflect on those of others. A certificate is awarded for attendance at all five sessions (contact the Network team for details).\r\n\r\nDates for 2012 are:\r\n\r\n8 March: What is the purpose of public assessments (Cambridge)\r\n12 April: What is the purpose of public assessments (Coventry)\r\n10 May: How can assessment support learning?

If all organisms are on one physical continuum, then we should also be on the same moral continuum.\r\n\r\nIn a deliberate ‘wake-up call’ to challenge the morality of current practices where nonhuman animals are being exploited in research, in farming, domestically and in the wild, Richard Ryder uses an original critical framework - Speciesism - drawing deliberate parallels with the terms racism and sexism, to point out that all such prejudices are based upon physical differences that are morally irrelevant. There is no absolute barrier between species and transgenic animals and so-called chimeras contain the genes of several species. How would we treat hominids of a different species if some turned up, or aliens from outer space? The latter may be highly intelligent, autonomous and of a different species, but should intelligence or autonomy or species affect moral status? Suffering, surely is the essential feature. A novel doctrine to be gleaned from such lines of enquiry is Painism, an ethical theory that rejects the validity of the aggregation (i.e. the adding up) of the pains and pleasures of several individuals, as found in Utilitarianism, emphasizing instead the moral importance of each individual and especially of the “maximum sufferer”.

But despite his brilliance, Tocqueville was wrong on this point and it was just an early example of attributing a greater role to the press in democracy than the news media merit. Journalism is one institution for holding government accountable to the public but it has to be understood in the context of the (four) others. And news can serve democracy but in a variety of ways, informing citizens about government being but one and not always the most important. Recognizing the broader ecology of accountability in a democracy is especially important today in assessing the role of journalism in the digital age.\r\n \r\nAbout the speaker and the discussant\r\n\r\nMichael Schudson is Professor of Communication at Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism. He is author of six books and editor of two others concerning the history and sociology of the American news media, advertising, popular culture, Watergate, and cultural memory. Among his books are The Power of News (1995) The Good Citizen: A History of American Civic Life (1998) and Why Democracies Need an Unlovable Press (2008). He is the recipient of a number of honours; he has been a Guggenheim fellow, and a MacArthur Foundation \"genius\" fellow. In 2004, he received the Murray Edelman distinguished career award from the political communication section of the American Political Science Association and the International Communication Association. Schudson's articles have appeared in the Columbia Journalism Review, Wilson Quarterly, and The American Prospect, and he has published op-eds in The New York Times, The Washington Post, Newsday, and the Financial Times. Most recently, together with Leonard Downie, Jr. (former executive editor of The Washington Post) he wrote a report on the current state of American Journalism. The widely-discussed report entitled The Reconstruction of American Journalism was published by the Columbia Journalism Review in October 2009.\r\n \r\nNatalie Fenton is a Reader in Media and Communications in the Department of Media and Communication, Goldsmiths, University of London where she is also Co-Director of the Goldsmiths Leverhulme Media Research Centre: Spaces, Connections, Control and Co-Director of Goldsmiths Centre for the Study of Global Media and Democracy.
