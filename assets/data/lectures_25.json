Presently cancer is killing 8.5 million people per year and by 2030, this number is estimated to reach 12 million.\r\nOne of the most serious obstacles facing scientists involved in the development and assessment of new anti-cancer drugs and therapies is the failure of preclinical cancer models able to predict, in a reliable way, whether a given drug will have anti-cancer activity and acceptable toxicity in humans. Most animal models are not representative of human situations and currently, more than 70-80% of cancer research is based on 2D models.\r\nLeading Portuguese scientist Professor Rui L. Reis has been named as the 2017 winner of the IET Harvey Prize – a £350,000 research grant for the furtherance of research in medical, microwave, laser or radar engineering.\r\nReis has been working for decades on the development of innovative Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine (TERM) strategies. In his lecture, Prof. Reis will talk about how tissue engineering (TE) can help to solve this situation, by means of creating novel breakthrough and reliable 3D engineered functional cancer disease models that can help to predict the efficacy of novel cancer drugs and potential therapies, avoiding a range of unnecessary animal tests, and preclinical and clinical trials of doomed to fail new drugs.\r\nProfessor Reis will give a lecture on his research at IET London: Savoy Place on 20 March 2018.

This lecture provides a contextual overview of the experiences of gay men and lesbians under National Socialism, especially the ways in which the Nazi regime targeted homosexual men, and the varying degrees of tolerance and actual persecution directed by the regime toward lesbians. However, the surveillance, management, prosecution, and punishment of same-sex affectional and erotic bonds must be understood in relation to the evidence of juridical laws and practices and their precedents in German cultural history, such as Paragraph 175 and its subsequent revision by the Nazis, as well as the perceived threat of homosexuality to racial and national fantasy, the family, reproductive and population politics, and the elimination of so-called social degeneracy. This means that Nazi homophobia, rather than being a separate axis of power, was part of a larger system of social and cultural organisation and was an effect of historically specific cultural, material, and ideological conditions. \r\n\r\nAt the same time, however, the historical record alone is not sufficient; feminist scholarship has already indicated that Holocaust research in general has not paid sufficient attention to the unique experiences of women under Nazism until recently given a (hetero-)masculinist bias in the narration of Holocaust history and a reluctance to address new questions, as well as elisions and ambiguities, in the interpretation of historical records and sources. Asking new questions about sexuality, for example, helps contest the prevailing notion that lesbians were not as systematically persecuted as gay men because lesbian sex was not specifically criminalised in the Reich Penal Code. This denies the historical fact of lesbian existence under National Socialism and lesbians’ lived experiences of displacement, forced migration, separation from lovers, and actual persecution and deportation. \r\n\r\nGiven that Nazi homophobia must not be reduced to a momentary aberration in history, the lecture will conclude by addressing the ways in which homophobia continued to find expression in the post-war criminalisation of homosexuality in both the former West and East Germany, as well as the failure to recognise more broadly across Europe the crimes perpetrated against gay and lesbian victims of Nazi atrocities. By illuminating the ways in which homophobia intersects with other forms of domination and continues to shape contemporary society and culture, and by approaching historical sources of the period with new questions about sexuality and gender, we deepen the meaning of the Holocaust and help shape its ongoing significance.\r\n\r\nWilliam J Spurlin is Professor of English and Director of Teaching and Learning for Arts & Humanities at Brunel University London. Previously, he was Professor of English at the University of Sussex, where he directed the Centre for the Study of Sexual Dissidence & Cultural Change for five years (2006-2011). Professor Spurlin has written extensively on the politics of gender and sexual dissidence and is widely known for his work on queer theory. His latest monograph, Lost Intimacies: Rethinking Homosexuality under National Socialism (2009), uses queer theory as a hermeneutic tool with which to read against the grain of hetero-textual narratives of the Holocaust and as a way for locating sexuality at its intersections with race, gender, and eugenics within the National Socialist imaginary. His book also challenges prevailing assumptions in the received scholarship that lesbians were not as systematically persecuted by the Nazis. The research for Lost Intimacies was funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC), and the book is widely cited and has been reviewed in such journals as Men and Masculinities; German Studies Review; International Review of Social History; and Zeitscrift für Geschichtswissenscaft. Professor Spurlin gave a series of invited lectures on his work in Holocaust studies last year across New Zealand, sponsored by the New Zealand Holocaust Centre, at universities, in public forums, and at the International Lesbian and Gay Alliance (ILGA) conference for Oceania in Wellington, where he delivered the Inaugural Robin Duff Memorial Lecture “What We Can Learn from the Persecution of Lesbians and Gay Men during the Holocaust and the Impact on LGBTQI Communities Today.”  He was also interviewed twice on New Zealand public radio about his Holocaust work.

By focusing on key areas of criminal law and procedure, the lecture will assesses the extent to which the Lisbon Treaty has transformed European criminal justice and evaluate the impact of post-Lisbon legislation on national criminal justice systems. The lecture will address the new powers of the Union to harmonise substantive criminal law and the influence of European Union law on national substantive criminal law; the Europeanisation of prosecution from horizontal co-operation between national criminal justice to forms of vertical integration in the field of prosecution as embodied in the evolution of Eurojust and the establishment of a European Public Prosecutor's Office; the operation of the principle of mutual recognition (by focusing in particular on the European Arrest Warrant System) and its impact on the relationship between mutual trust and fundamental rights; and the relationship between mutual recognition and harmonisation of criminal procedure, in particular via the adoption of EU law on defence rights. Informed by the challenges of a potential Brexit, the lecture will address the impact of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights on the constitutionalisation of EU criminal law after Lisbon and highlight the possibilities that the Lisbon Treaty opens for the development of a new paradigm of European criminal justice, which places the individual (and not the state), and the protection of fundamental rights (and not security) at its core.\r\n\r\nThe lecture will be followed by a drinks reception and a book launch. \r\n\r\nInvited discussants: Advocate General Eleanor Sharpston QC, Court of Justice of the European Union, Professor Marise Cremona, Professor of European Law and formerly President ad interim, European University Institute and Professor Jörg Monar, Rector, College of Europe. \r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 60, "image_id": 2500, "added": "2016-04-10T09:55:59", "slug": "48389350c2784811", "speakers": [{"id": 16107, "name": "Professor Valsamis Mitsilegas", "slug": "professor-valsamis-mitsilegas"}], "topics": [{"id": 2940, "name": "europe", "path": "/academic/history/european/history/earlymoderneuropeanhistory/eu"}, {"id": 2482, "name": "europe", "path": "/business/economy/growth/welfare/europe"}, {"id": 2330, "name": "europe", "path": "/academic/law/intellectualpropertylaw/europe"}, {"id": 2790, "name": "europe", "path": "/academic/culture/modernjewishhistoryandculture/europe"}], "supercategory": "academic", "venue": {"id": 2936, "name": "Arts Two Lecture Theatre", "slug": "arts-two-lecture-theatre", "city": "London", "postcode": "E1 4NS"}, "organizer": {"id": 3213, "name": "Events Office, Queen Mary University of London", "slug": "events-office-queen-mary-university-of-london"}, "date": "2016-06-09", "dates": [{"id": 15853, "from_date": "2016-06-09", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "6:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Free - booking in advance is required", "ticket_info": "https://professorvalsamismitsilegas.eventbrite.co.uk ", "additional_info": "For any further information please contact b.prescott@qmul.ac.uk", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 2936, "name": "Arts Two Lecture Theatre", "slug": "arts-two-lecture-theatre", "city": "London", "postcode": "E1 4NS"}, "organizer": {"id": 3213, "name": "Events Office, Queen Mary University of London", "slug": "events-office-queen-mary-university-of-london"}}]}, {"id": 14941, "title": "A British-Owned Congo: Roger Casement’s Battle with Slavery in Peru (1910-1914)", "synopsis": "Talk focusing on anti-slavery lobbyist Roger Casement, who was hanged on a charge of treason by the British Government in 1916.", "keywords": "Congo, Casement, treason, slavery, Peru, human rights, brutal regime", "body": "Roger Casement was the twentieth century’s first outstanding humanitarian.

Along the various routes that make up the network of the ‘Silk Road’ - itself a misnomer - flourished an exotic mixture of cultures from Arabic, Turkic, Iranian, Indian, Mongolian, Chinese and Tibetan sources.\r\n\r\nThe richness of cultures is evident in spectacular sites ranging from abandoned cities and fortresses, Buddhist cave sites and Islamic mausoleums along the many trade routes that made the Silk Road network. The Taklamakan and Gobi desert regions yielded many artistic treasures to 19th and 20th century European archaeologists who explored - and plundered - many sites for their uniquely preserved artefacts. The research that came from these items revealed much more understanding about the relevance and significance of the Silk Road and its place in the economic history of the region.\r\n\r\nThe legacy of the Silk Road lives on through the artefacts, writings, maps and contribution of the many travellers throughout the region over many centuries.

It will look at the diverse cultures that practiced different religions and produced exotic items that were traded freely along the routes, and what became of them in later years.

What had been a minor regional school achieved international prominence and influenced the future of European art in general for centuries. Central to this achievement was the genius of a succession of painters from Giovanni Bellini and his brother Gentile, Carpaccio, Giorgione, to the great Titian and his younger contemporaries Tintoretto and Veronese. These painters worked in a city undergoing crisis and change: the decline of its maritime empire, the reduction of its monopoly of trade with the East, its near destruction as a state in the early sixteenth century, and the religious turmoil engendered by the Reformation and the reaction of the Roman Church to it. Governed by an oligarchy of merchant nobles who elected a Doge, Venice remained politically stable throughout this turbulent period and continued to flourish economically. The state, the lay confraternities (called scuole) and private individuals provided sufficient patronage and support for a brilliant school of painting to develop in both secular and religious art. The cultural context and history of this school will be studied in eight lectures, followed by a full-day visit to the National Gallery to consider first-hand its outstanding collection of Venetian renaissance paintings.\r\n \r\n\r\n", "keywords": "arts, art, history, Renaissance Venice, Giovanni Bellini, Antonello da Messina, 'Sacra Conversazione', Titian, public paintings, eligious paintings, Habsburg rulers, Van Dyck, 'Assumption of the Virgin Mary' in the Franciscan church of the Frari, Giorgione, Gabriele Vendramin, Accademia  Gallery in Venice, High Renaissance' style, Alfonso d'Este of Ferrara, Federico Gonzaga of Mantua, Bacchus and Ariadne' now in the National Gallery, Charles V, King Philip II of Spain", "body": "Titian's reputation soon spread well beyond Venice and he was by the 1520s working for the North Italian rulers like Alfonso d'Este of Ferrara and Federico Gonzaga of Mantua.

He was introduced by the latter to the Holy Roman Emperor, Charles V, whose court artist he became in 1532. It was the son of Charles V, King Philip II of Spain, who was to become Titian's principal patron from the 1550s onwards, commissioning from him the 'Poesie' based on Ovid's 'Metamorphoses', two of which now commute between the National Galleries of Scotland and England.", "additional_info": null, "duration": 300, "image_id": null, "added": "2014-05-02T09:34:55", "slug": "2853619ac5c5fae8", "speakers": [{"id": 14666, "name": "Dr Michael Douglas-Scott", "slug": "dr-michael-douglas-scott"}], "topics": [{"id": 131, "name": "authors", "path": "/arts/literature/fiction/british/21stcentury/authors"}, {"id": 106, "name": "wwi", "path": "/arts/books/history/military/wwi"}, {"id": 107, "name": "wwii", "path": "/arts/books/history/military/wwii"}, {"id": 108, "name": "army", "path": "/arts/books/history/military/army"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 2725, "name": "The University Women's Club", "slug": "the-university-womens-club", "city": "London", "postcode": "W1K 1DB"}, "organizer": {"id": 2290, "name": "THE COURSE", "slug": "the-course"}, "date": "2014-11-20", "dates": [{"id": 14177, "from_date": "2014-11-20", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "10:45:00", "ticket_cost": "£46", "ticket_info": "info@thecoursestudies.co.uk", "additional_info": "visit www.thecoursestudies.co.uk", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 2725, "name": "The University Women's Club", "slug": "the-university-womens-club", "city": "London", "postcode": "W1K 1DB"}, "organizer": {"id": 2290, "name": "THE COURSE", "slug": "the-course"}}]}, {"id": 13610, "title": "Treasures of the Court / Emperors Go-Y&#333;zei (r. 1586–1611) & Go-Mizunoo (r. 1611–1629) & &#8203;", "synopsis": "Covering 500 years, 38 patrons and several continents, this course is an examination of audacious acts of patronage and how they resulted in some of the finest art collections in the world.\r\n", "keywords": "arts, art, history, royal collections, royal patronage, Emperors Go-Y&#333;zei (r. 1586–1611),    Go-Mizunoo (r. 1611–1629)   &#8203;Empress T&#333;fukomon'in,   Japan\r\n", "body": "Emperors Go-Y&#333;zei (r. 1586–1611) & Go-Mizunoo (r. 1611–1629) & &#8203;Empress T&#333;fukomon'in of Japan\r\n\r\nEmperor Go-Y&#333;zei was highly cultured as was his son Go-Mizunoo.

He is an elected member of the International Sports Engineering Association executive committee.\r\n\r\nThe lecture is free to attend and will be followed by a networking drinks reception.\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 120, "image_id": 1664, "added": "2012-02-10T15:24:32", "slug": "bf059c8bb6a16a6e", "speakers": [{"id": 6776, "name": "Dr David James", "slug": "dr-david-james"}], "topics": [{"id": 778, "name": "engineering", "path": "/science/engineering/engineering/engineering"}, {"id": 2816, "name": "paralympics", "path": "/sport/paralympics"}, {"id": 777, "name": "engineering", "path": "/science/engineering/engineering"}, {"id": 1060, "name": "engineering", "path": "/society/technology/engineering"}, {"id": 2817, "name": "sportstechnology", "path": "/sport/sportstechnology"}], "supercategory": "science", "venue": {"id": 2622, "name": "IET London: Savoy Place", "slug": "iet-london-savoy-place", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC2R 0BL"}, "organizer": {"id": 1343, "name": "The IET", "slug": "the-iet"}, "date": "2012-05-24", "dates": [{"id": 11224, "from_date": "2012-05-24", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "18:00:00", "ticket_cost": "Free to attend", "ticket_info": "Book your place online at http://conferences.theiet.org/sportstech/index.cfm?origin=lecture-list", "additional_info": null, "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 2622, "name": "IET London: Savoy Place", "slug": "iet-london-savoy-place", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC2R 0BL"}, "organizer": {"id": 1343, "name": "The IET", "slug": "the-iet"}}]}, {"id": 10780, "title": "Creative Practice Seminar for Artists: The Place To Be", "synopsis": "Lecture on Networking, Blogging and Social Media, Making Applications, Writing Proposals & Arts Opportunities", "keywords": "Blogging, Networking, Artists, writing", "body": " \r\nCreative Practice Seminars for Artists.\r\n\r\nIn Partnership with Goldsmiths and Lewisham Arts Services\r\n\r\n£10 early bird tickets per seminar or £12.50 on the door.\r\n\r\n\r\nChaired by Rosalind Davis and Annabel Tilley, ZeitgeistArtsProjects\r\n\r\nTo book please go to www.ZeitgeistArtsProjects.com\r\n\r\nFurther information: diyeducate@gmail.com  \r\n\r\nPractical toolkits for artists: finance, marketing, writing funding applications and selling your work and using social media, with leading artists, arts professionals.  \r\n\r\nThe Place To Be!\r\n\r\nSpeakers: Jack Hutchinson, Rob Turner, Brigid Howarth (Lewisham Arts Service) , Matthew Couper, Deptford X, Julia Alvarez, (SLAM)  \r\n\t  \t  \t\t\r\n\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 240, "image_id": null, "added": "2012-02-05T13:37:50", "slug": "bfb62a0cc3559611", "speakers": [{"id": 12022, "name": "Mr Jack Hutchinson", "slug": "mr-jack-hutchinson"}, {"id": 11124, "name": "Mr Rob Turner", "slug": "mr-rob-turner"}, {"id": 12023, "name": "Ms Briget Howarth", "slug": "ms-briget-howarth"}, {"id": 12024, "name": "Mr Matthew Couper", "slug": "mr-matthew-couper"}, {"id": 12025, "name": "Ms Julia Alvarez", "slug": "ms-julia-alvarez"}], "topics": [{"id": 1026, "name": "artists", "path": "/religion/islam/women/artists"}, {"id": 433, "name": "writing", "path": "/arts/literature/writing"}, {"id": 1157, "name": "networking", "path": "/academic/arts/networking"}, {"id": 2598, "name": "artists", "path": "/arts/artists/artists"}], "supercategory": "religion", "venue": {"id": 939, "name": "Goldsmiths College, University of London", "slug": "goldsmiths-college-university-of-london", "city": "London", "postcode": "SE14 6NW"}, "organizer": {"id": 2470, "name": "Core Gallery", "slug": "core-gallery"}, "date": "2012-03-03", "dates": [{"id": 11211, "from_date": "2012-03-03", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "13:00:00", "ticket_cost": "£10 or £12.50 on the door", "ticket_info": "diyeducate@gmail.com\r\nwww.ZeitgeistArtsProjects.com", "additional_info": null, "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 939, "name": "Goldsmiths College, University of London", "slug": "goldsmiths-college-university-of-london", "city": "London", "postcode": "SE14 6NW"}, "organizer": {"id": 2470, "name": "Core Gallery", "slug": "core-gallery"}}]}, {"id": 10755, "title": "The archaeology and material culture of Hajj in sub-Saharan Africa", "synopsis": "Tim Insoll explores the history, processes, archaeology and material culture of Hajj in sub-Saharan Africa since the 8th-9th centuries AD.

Alan Johnson’s decision to remove Nutt for ‘campaigning against government policy’ led two other advisers to resign in protest, and nearly caused a mass rebellion of scientists. For some, Nutt has been punished for merely confirming what many already suspect: that illegal drugs are not as harmful as their legal counterparts such as alcohol and nicotine, and that drug policy is underpinned by moral concerns and tabloid appeal rather than scientific evidence.\r\n\r\nSome commentators argue, however, that in a democracy it's politicians who are elected to made decisions and not their scientific advisors. Furthermore, there’s nothing wrong with politicians basing judgement on morality. Meanwhile, Nutt's supporters point out the government is only happy to use scientific evidence when it suits them.\r\n\r\nWhat lies behind the rise of evidence-based policy-making?

Not Beatlemania but Burnsmania.\r\n\r\nWhy was the Burns legacy so powerful after his death - much more so than all of the great celebrity Scots who died after him, and why did Scots feel more passionately about what Burns represented in 1850 than they do now? Why was there a contest to 'own' Burns, with towns and cities, conservatives and radicals fighting to claim the bard as their own?\r\n\r\nRobert Burns is today a global icon, and his image is used to advertise a range of products, and to induce visitors to Scotland's places of interest, albeit that some have only a faint link with the poet.\r\n\r\nBurns is still celebrated, but in many respects Burns has been neutered, his memory an excuse for conviviality and good cheer, his name a device for selling food and drink.

Numerous projects and initiatives have developed over recent years and the international e-Biosphere conference, held in London in June 2009, has shown that the field of Biodiversity Informatics has come of age.  Our capacity to digitise natural history specimens and other taxonomic information and to distribute the resultant products online has great potential and some pitfalls. \r\n\r\nMalcolm will explore and illustrate selected developments in this field and their implication for taxonomists and for the future of taxonomy.  Traditional skills of identification, species description and natural history are declining as the current cohort of practitioners’ age (at least in the developed world): younger taxonomists are enthused more by the power of molecular systematics for resolving phylogenetic pattern.  But many are being attracted by the potential and the methods for democratising taxonomic information through online distribution.  A further consideration is that taxonomic data can now be made available not only by professional taxonomists, but by anyone moderately Web-literate.  Wider involvement is beneficial, although the issue of data quality arises.  This democratisation means that taxonomists will lose some control of what was a somewhat closed domain often with impenetrable jargon.  Instead of fighting the inevitable, taxonomists should perceive themselves more as information synthesisers and brokers.  While such a change in perception may blur the edges of taxonomy, it should attract a wider community to understand, enjoy and help conserve the natural world.\r\n\r\n\r\nDr Malcolm Scoble is an entomologist with research interests in the taxonomy of the Lepidoptera and in Web-based taxonomy.  In the last decade he and his colleagues have specialised in the taxonomy of Geometridae, the moths with ‘looper’ caterpillars, and in using this family as a model group to assess patterns of species description and regional richness.  Another area of interest is in developing new approaches to improve access to information in natural history collections.  He has held appointments at the Transvaal Museum (Pretoria, South Africa), Oxford University Museum of Natural History, and the Natural History Museum, London, where he is currently Keeper (Head) of the Entomology Department.  He received a PhD from Rhodes University and a DSc from the University of London.

If it goes unchecked, the consequences are likely to be catastrophic for human life on earth. Yet for most people, and for many policy-makers too, it tends to be a 'back of the mind' issue. We recognise its importance and even its urgency, but for the most part it is swamped by more immediate concerns. Politicians have woken up to the dangers, but at the moment their responses are mainly on the level of gesture rather than being, as they have to be, both concrete and radical.\r\n\r\nPolitical action and intervention, on local, national and international levels, is going to have a decisive effect on whether or not we can limit global warming, as well as how we adapt to that already occurring. At the moment, however, Anthony Giddens argues controversially, we do not have a systematic politics of climate change. Politics-as-usual won't allow us to deal with the problems we face, while the recipes of the main challenger to orthodox politics, the green movement, are flawed at source. Giddens introduces a range of new concepts and proposals to fill in the gap, and examines in depth the connections between climate change and energy security.\r\n\r\nAnthony Giddens is professor emeritus of sociology at LSE and former School director.

This lecture examines these perspectives and puts them in a historical context. ‘Ordinary lives’ have been a focus of documentary interest and ‘ordinary people’ have featured as media performers since the days of pre-war radio. There have however been significant historical shifts in how the ‘ordinary’ has been understood and represented. Since the 1960s it has developed a complex interplay with notions of ‘celebrity’ to the point where, nowadays, the ‘celebrification’ of the ordinary person is common. Opportunities are increasing for ordinary people to become celebrities not only in broadcasting but also in new social media and various forms of ‘web presence’.

About the Institut français du Royaume-Uni\r\n\r\nFounded in 1910 by a private benefactor, the Institut français is the official French government centre of language and culture, one of the 150 Instituts troughout the world and one of  the oldest French cultural centres based abroad. The Language Centre offers a wide range of courses in general or specialised French language, while the Cultural Centre stresses two areas: French, European and World cinema and cutting-edge writing and thought.\r\n\r\nh4. The Language Centre\r\n\r\nThe Language Centre offers tuition to over 6000 students a year and has 75 carefully selected, highly professional tutors. Courses are continually being adapted to suit the requirements of our students. In addition to traditional language courses, we have courses covering French culture, current affairs and business French.\r\n\r\nh4. Ciné lumière\r\n\r\nLaunched by Catherine Deneuve in March 1998, Ciné lumière is an independent showcase for the very best in French, European and world cinema. Our repertory features some 600 screenings a year. Festivals, seasons, retrospectives, premieres, new releases, guest star appearances: Ciné lumière is an everyday festival. A public cinema with 300 seats, Ciné lumière is open to everyone. You don't have to be a member of the Institut français - nor do you have to speak French! All films are shown in original version with English subtitles.\r\n\r\nh4. The Multimedia Library\r\n\r\nOur multimedia library offers free access to 52 000 items: books, French newspapers and magazines, videos & DVDs, CDs  and CD-ROMs aimed at Francophiles, French speakers or learners. The library also supplies information services such as the Quick Information Service which provides information and documentation on contemporary France and francophone countries, and the Studies in France Information Desk which promotes cultural and educational exchanges between France and Great Britain.\r\n\r\nh4. Talks Programme\r\n\r\nThe Institut français has a varied programme of talks, giving a wide range of speakers the opportunity to express themselves freely and enter into a dialogue with the public. Thanks to the book launches our audiences are the first to know about the latest translations from French and publications about France.\r\n\r\nh4. French Music Bureau\r\n\r\nThe French Music Bureau is a unique collaboration between the French Government (Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Culture) and the domestic music industry to improve the profile of French popular music in both the UK and worldwide markets.
