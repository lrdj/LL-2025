Julia Samuel is a psychotherapist specialising in grief, who has spent the last twenty-five years working with bereaved families. She was a counsellor at St Mary’s Hospital for over two decades, providing guidance and emotional support to those living through the tragedy of a child’s death. In 1994 she helped launch and establish Child Bereavement UK, as Founder Patron, a leading national charity which offers support for families who have lost a child and children who have themselves experienced loss.\r\n\r\nAlthough bereavement has become more openly discussed in recent decades, death itself remains one of the most taboo subjects in our society, one which we often struggle to address directly. As Julia herself has put it – “Death is the great exposer: it forces hidden fault lines and submerged secrets into the open, and reveals to us how crucial those closest to us have been.” Even in situations where we do not experience bereavement explicitly – in divorce, for example, or when events conspire to permanently deny us certain opportunities – we can experience this shattering dimension of loss.\r\n\r\nDrawing from her many years of professional experience, Julia will begin the evening by giving a talk on the nature of the grieving process: how we heal and how we come to terms with loss. This will include a detailed explanation of the eight ‘Pillars of Strength’ which she has identified in the course of her career – developing them into a comprehensive system of support for all those coping with bereavement. The evening will also involve (entirely voluntary) periods of interaction and participation; audience members will be invited to share their experiences of grief and will be invited to pose questions for Julia in a Q&A session.\r\n\r\nDifferent segments will be broken up by group song, as audience members are invited to join in concert, singing popular songs with uplifting messages of shared sorrow and the overcoming of pain.

", "keywords": "books, politics", "body": "How does the City of London exert such power on the global economy? The City is a key part of the mechanism by which economic power gets transferred to major companies. It handles 41% of all the world’s dealing in foreign exchange and nearly half of all interest rate derivative deals between banks and their clients. But while banks are at the centre of this network, they mainly act as the intermediaries for others. Big corporations are the drivers of these deals. They aim to boost their market power, especially through mergers and takeovers, and are helped by their access to financial markets.\r\n\r\nTony Norfield details, with shocking and insightful research, the role of the US dollar in global trading, the network of British linked tax havens, the flows of finance around the world and the system of power built upon financial securities. Samsung and Apple provide 40% of the world’s smartphones and just five companies produce half the world’s beer. Why do just fifty companies now have control of a large share of world economic production? How have we reached the point where this concentration of financial and economic power has accumulated in these few companies? And what does this say for the prospects of social and political change? \r\n\r\nThe City explains how this situation came about, examining the history of the world economy from the post-war period to the present day. If you imagine you don’t like “finance” but have no problem with the capitalist market system, think again: it turns out the two cannot be separated.\r\n\r\nThis event is part of Housman’s ‘London’s Burning’ season.\r\n\r\nReviews\r\n\r\n“How many Marxists are at work in the dealing rooms of the City?

The result is this fascinating book.”– Morning Star\r\n\r\n“It is not every day you read a book about global finance by a banker who quotes Lenin approvingly on page two. Unlike many of those who produce Marxist critiques of financial capitalism, Norfield writes from a position of experience: he has worked in the belly of the beast, and the book is the better for it...In The City, he has done the research and pulled together the financial statistics that explain how the bloodsucking works.”– Brooke Masters, Financial Times\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 60, "image_id": 2217, "added": "2016-06-18T09:42:18", "slug": "776207b1ac1554f4", "speakers": [{"id": 16245, "name": "Tony Norfield", "slug": "tony-norfield"}], "topics": [{"id": 106, "name": "wwi", "path": "/arts/books/history/military/wwi"}, {"id": 107, "name": "wwii", "path": "/arts/books/history/military/wwii"}, {"id": 108, "name": "army", "path": "/arts/books/history/military/army"}, {"id": 109, "name": "navy", "path": "/arts/books/history/military/navy"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 2783, "name": "Housmans Bookshop", "slug": "housmans-bookshop", "city": "London", "postcode": "N1 9DX"}, "organizer": {"id": 2783, "name": "Housmans Bookshop", "slug": "housmans-bookshop"}, "date": "2016-08-03", "dates": [{"id": 16010, "from_date": "2016-08-03", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "19:00:00", "ticket_cost": "£3 redeemable", "ticket_info": null, "additional_info": null, "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 2783, "name": "Housmans Bookshop", "slug": "housmans-bookshop", "city": "London", "postcode": "N1 9DX"}, "organizer": {"id": 2783, "name": "Housmans Bookshop", "slug": "housmans-bookshop"}}]}, {"id": 4753, "title": "Breaking Down Brick Walls: What’s Been Done Before?", "synopsis": "Else Churchill, the Society's Genealogist, presents a step by step guide for identifying manuscript and printed genealogical research material in the Society's Library.", "keywords": "family history, ancestors, records at SoG", "body": "This workshop gives you an opportunity to tackle genealogical brick walls and conundrums in a group environment.

With a   chequered  history of  Roman occupation,   Chartist  uprisings, and  as a    critically important  sea port and railway town   Newport  has  quickly  developed  to meet the expansion of  economic and industrial heartlands of Wales.  Newport is well  described as   a  haven of  modern Britain   with  its   exotic  mix  of settlers   of  Welsh, Irish,  English,  Italian, Arab and Asian origins, and it  is certainly one of the  most  lively multi-cultural and  cosmopolitan cities of  the country.\r\n\r\nThe town’s allegiance to the British monarchy has had its troubled past. As late as Queen Victoria’s Jubilee of 1897  the residents of Newport were only  lurkwarm  in their celebrations.  However the succession of   20th century Princes of Wales have all  found more love and   interest    created by their  actions and  high public profiles  with  more affection shown for them   in Wales across  religions, creeds and classes.  The charismatic Edward,  Prince of Wales was widely welcomed in Newport in 1921 when he rode  on the town’s famous Transporter  Bridge.   In 1937 the new King George VI and Queen  Elizabeth visited Newport to much praise and  public cheering.  After the Second World War  several members of the Royal family passed through Newport and received a  good Welsh welcome.    It has not just been Royals who have given Newport the pleasure of a visit,    many  VIPS  from all walks of life , politicians, Prime Ministers, stars of stage, screen and TV have also appeared in the town ( now a City).

In this session there will be two presentations looking at how examiners in different contexts arrive at their judgements, and what variables have an influence on the judgements that are made\r\n\r\nCognitive cherry picking: the patchwork process of examining A level essays (Victoria Elliott)\r\n\r\nThe assumption of the A level system is that examiners make their decisions in a rule-based, logical way. However, given the time constraints under which examiners work, and the amount of information which must be considered, it is unlikely that the cognitive process is as rational as it is conceived to be. Essay subjects, such as history and English (two subjects which are associated with difficulty of marking), are likely to form a particular challenge in terms of the limits of working memory. The fact remains that most examiners mark within accepted margins of reliability. How, then, do they make these decisions, given the amount of information and the limited time available?\r\n\r\nThis paper considers some of the data gathered during an in-depth study of examiners’ training and decision-making, utilising Verbal Protocol Analyses of live marking and recordings of training meetings. A wide range of cognitive processes are demonstrated in the data, which are used to varying degrees by different examiners, at different times within and between scripts, according to the most useful, and potentially the most economical method at any one time.\r\n\r\nInfluences on rater judgements of second language speech (Dr Talia Isaacs)\r\n\r\nThe overall goal of this presentation is to examine rater perceptions of second language (L2) speech to identify possible sources of rater bias and shed light on the focal construct. First, we will examine the effects of individual differences in rater cognitive variables (musical ability, phonological memory, and attention control) on raters’ judgements of L2 comprehensibility (ease of understanding), accentedness (degree of foreign accent), and fluency (speed of delivery and smoothness). If these cognitive variables are found to exert a measurable influence on the scores that raters assign, then this could pose a threat to the validity of the assessments. Next, we will examine the way that ‘comprehensibility’ is operationalised in current L2 speaking scales (e.g., Cambridge ESOL Common Scale for Speaking, IELTS pronunciation scale). We will then examine how a greater understanding of the linguistic dimensions that underlie listeners’ L2 comprehensibility ratings can elucidate our understanding of the construct at different levels of ability. Implications for rating scale validation and for rater training in high-stakes assessment settings will be discussed.\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 1403, "added": "2011-12-01T09:56:37", "slug": "0949cd2ce6426a3d", "speakers": [{"id": 11798, "name": "Victoria Elliott", "slug": "victoria-elliott"}, {"id": 11799, "name": "Dr Talia Isaacs", "slug": "dr-talia-isaacs"}], "topics": [{"id": 743, "name": "education", "path": "/academic/arts/linguistics/education"}, {"id": 2192, "name": "assessment", "path": "/academic/education/assessment"}, {"id": 744, "name": "education", "path": "/academic/linguistics/education"}, {"id": 745, "name": "education", "path": "/arts/language/education"}], "supercategory": "academic", "venue": {"id": 1424, "name": "Downing College", "slug": "downing-college", "city": "Cambridge", "postcode": "CB2 1DQ"}, "organizer": {"id": 2297, "name": "Cambridge Assessment Network", "slug": "cambridge-assessment-network"}, "date": "2012-09-06", "dates": [{"id": 10847, "from_date": "2012-09-06", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "16:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Free to attend", "ticket_info": null, "additional_info": "To book a place please contact the Network Team on 01223 553846 or thenetwork@cambridgeassessment.org.uk.", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 1424, "name": "Downing College", "slug": "downing-college", "city": "Cambridge", "postcode": "CB2 1DQ"}, "organizer": {"id": 2297, "name": "Cambridge Assessment Network", "slug": "cambridge-assessment-network"}}]}, {"id": 10364, "title": "Crowd Wise: Designing the Best Water Systems for Cities of the Future ", "synopsis": "Designing the Best Water Systems for Cities of the Future", "keywords": "Engineering, Water Resources", "body": "Some of the greatest global challenges are related to water.

Cosmologists talk about black-holes, objects so gravitationally powerful that nothing, not even light, can escape from them. Unwary space travellers passing too close will find themselves sucked in.\r\n\r\nOur contemporary cultural landscape contains numerous intellectual black-holes – belief systems constructed in such a way that unwary passers-by can similarly find themselves drawn in. While those of us lacking robust intellectual and other psychological defences will be most easily trapped by such self-sealing bubbles of belief, even the most intelligent and educated of us are potentially vulnerable. Some of the world’s greatest thinkers have fallen in, never to escape. If you find yourself encountering a belief system in which several of these mechanisms feature prominently, be wary. Alarm bells should be going off and warning lights flashing.

Underpinning this work was a belief in racial brotherhood rooted in the greatest moral movement of the age, for the abolition of slavery. \r\n\r\nBut slavery did not evolve out of existence; it had to be destroyed. Intractable slavery collided with Darwin's post-Christian progressivism during the American Civil War. The triumph of the abolitionists' `sacred cause' enabled him to carry `the grand idea of God hating sin and loving righteousness' into The Descent of Man, where the driving of formerly enslaved races out of existence is naturalized as a by-product of human progress.\r\n \r\nJames Moore has researched Darwin's life and times for many years while teaching at the Open University and abroad. With Adrian Desmond, he wrote the best-selling biography Darwin, now widely translated, and his other books include The Darwin Legend and The Post-Darwinian Controversies.

He is one of North Africa's most successful and acclaimed writers. Born in Fez, Morocco, in 1944, he emigrated to France in 1971 and now lives in Paris. His international reputation was heightened with L´Enfant de sable (The Sand Child) and its sequel, La Nuit sacrée (The Sacred Night) which won the prestigious Prix Goncourt in 1987.

Ageing is generally considered a process which converts healthy adults into frail ones with diminished reserves in most of our body systems and an increasing susceptibility to diseases and to death.\r\n\r\n\r\nAgeing is a mystery in the sense that cancer, hereditary development and infection were once mysteries.\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, there have been huge recent advances in understanding of some of the fundamental determinants of ageing.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese provide real possibilities not only for our increased lifespan, but also for an increased healthy lifespan.\r\n\r\n\r\nOver the past century there have been truly remarkable changes in the numbers and characteristics of older people throughout the world. The growth of the older population has occurred because a general increase in overall population size and a major decline in several of the leading causes of death. Because the increase in survival has been accompanied by a decline in birth-rate the proportion of the population over 65 years of age has increased dramatically and will continue to do so over the next 50 years. These demographic transformations have an enormous effect on society that reverberates well beyond the increased care needs associated with older people.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis lecture will discuss the reasons behind this age related demographic shift, recent advances in our knowledge of the ageing process and what determines poor health in ageing and frailty, and the current state of the art in preventing age related frailty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProfessor Rose Anne Kenny is head of the Department of Geriatric medicine in the University of Newcastle and has a long standing reputation in research in age related diseases, particularly heart disease, gait and mobility problems and stroke disease.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnless otherwise noted, lectures start at 5.30, last one hour and take place in the Curtis Auditorium, Herschel Building, which sits directly across the road from Haymarket Metro Station.
