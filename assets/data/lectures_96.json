Find out where to start and what to do.  The records that relate to the birth, a marriage and the death of an individual are referred to as the civil registration records. They are the fundamental building blocks of your family tree. Civil registration began in England in 1837, in Scotland records began in 1855 and in Ireland in 1864 (Irish non-Catholic marriages were recorded from 1845). However, registering a birth only became compulsory in 1874 so before then, children may not have been registered. Nineteenth and early twentieth century census returns give us a snapshot of a family living together in a household on the night of the census. It's true that the records are online now but just entering your ancestors' names in a search program may not give you any results or you may find people with similar names that aren't actually part of your direct family tree.\r\n\r\nIn this half-day course, Louise Taylor covers:\r\n- how to correctly trace certificates of birth, marriage and death (civil registration);\r\n- why it's important to find evidence of these milestones in your ancestors' lives;\r\n- how to find your ancestors in census records.\r\n\r\nThere are no special requirements for this workshop and you do not need to be a Member of the Society of Genealogists to attend.

During the break for tea or coffee, you can chat to other people attending who share your interests.\t\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 180, "image_id": 2279, "added": "2016-02-25T16:08:09", "slug": "family-history-for-beginners-births-marriages-deaths-and-census-records", "speakers": [{"id": 15389, "name": "Louise Taylor", "slug": "louise-taylor"}], "topics": [{"id": 3808, "name": "familyhistory", "path": "/society/education/familyhistory"}, {"id": 3807, "name": "adultworkshops", "path": "/society/education/adultworkshops"}, {"id": 3805, "name": "gettingstarted", "path": "/leisure/familyhistory/gettingstarted"}, {"id": 3806, "name": "recordsandarchives", "path": "/leisure/localhistory/recordsandarchives"}], "supercategory": "society", "venue": {"id": 1467, "name": "Society of Genealogists", "slug": "society-of-genealogists", "city": "London", "postcode": "EC1M 7BA"}, "organizer": {"id": 1467, "name": "Society of Genealogists", "slug": "society-of-genealogists"}, "date": "2016-04-02", "dates": [{"id": 15042, "from_date": "2016-04-02", "to_date": "2016-04-02", "time": "14:00:00", "ticket_cost": "£20.00", "ticket_info": "Visit our website (www.sog.org.uk), email us events@sog.org.uk or phone us 020 7553 3290.\r\n", "additional_info": "To hold a place for you, the workshop must be paid and booked in advance.", "members_only": "No", "members_info": "A discounted price of £16.00 is available for Members of the Society of Genealogists.", "venue": {"id": 1467, "name": "Society of Genealogists", "slug": "society-of-genealogists", "city": "London", "postcode": "EC1M 7BA"}, "organizer": {"id": 1467, "name": "Society of Genealogists", "slug": "society-of-genealogists"}}]}, {"id": 15114, "title": "Art, Literature and Environmental Justice ", "synopsis": "The role of arts in the fight for environmental justice in West Africa and beyond.", "keywords": "art/environment/Africa/panel/discussion/literature/justice", "body": "Just over twenty years ago writer and activist Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight Ogoni activists were executed by the Nigerian military government for their campaign against the exploitation of the Niger Delta by Shell.

Along the various routes that make up the network of the ‘Silk Road’ - itself a misnomer - flourished an exotic mixture of cultures from Arabic, Turkic, Iranian, Indian, Mongolian, Chinese and Tibetan sources.\r\n\r\nThe richness of cultures is evident in spectacular sites ranging from abandoned cities and fortresses, Buddhist cave sites and Islamic mausoleums along the many trade routes that made the Silk Road network. The Taklamakan and Gobi desert regions yielded many artistic treasures to 19th and 20th century European archaeologists who explored - and plundered - many sites for their uniquely preserved artefacts. The research that came from these items revealed much more understanding about the relevance and significance of the Silk Road and its place in the economic history of the region.\r\n\r\nThe legacy of the Silk Road lives on through the artefacts, writings, maps and contribution of the many travellers throughout the region over many centuries. However, this legacy may soon be found only in museums and collections, as the rapidly changing landscape of modern technology changes the face of this region.\r\n\r\nThe course aims to understand how and why the Silk Road trade network came into being and to explore reasons for the success and demise of its cities and traders in certain areas and eras. It will look at the diverse cultures that practiced different religions and produced exotic items that were traded freely along the routes, and what became of them in later years.

The feature-length film by Becky Edmunds follows Deborah Hay and 20 selected artists as they engage with the intensive process of adapting a solo dance. The film traces Hay’s practice as she continues to redefine what performance is and how performers perform.\r\n\r\nDeborah Hay was born in Brooklyn. Her mother was her first dance teacher, and directed her training until she was a teenager. She moved to Manhattan in the 1960’s, where she continued her training with Merce Cunningham and Mia Slavenska. In 1964, Hay danced with the Cunningham Dance Company during a 6-month tour through Europe and Asia.\r\n\r\nDeborah Hay was a member of a group of experimental artists that was deeply influenced by Merce Cunningham and John Cage. The group, later known as the Judson Dance Theater, became one of the most radical and explosive 20th century art movements.\r\n\r\nBy 1967, Hay had already achieved a prominent status as a young choreographer, and her unique style began to emerge as a distinct voice within the aesthetics of Judson. Sharing with her colleagues the ideas that dance engage with other art forms, and that the artificial distinction between trained and untrained performers be challenged, she focused on large-scale dance projects involving untrained dancers, fragmented and choreographed music accompaniment, and the execution of ordinary movement patterns performed under stressful conditions.\r\n\r\nIn 1970 she left New York to live in a community in northern Vermont. Soon, she distanced herself from the performing arena, producing 10 “Circle Dances,” performed on 10 consecutive nights within a single community and no audience whatsoever. Thus began a long period of reflection about how dance is transmitted and presented. Her first book, Moving Through the Universe in Bare Feet (Swallow Press, 1975), is an early example of her distinctive memory/concept mode of choreographic record, and emphasizes the narratives underlining the process of her dance-making, rather than the technical specifications or notations of their form.\r\n\r\nIn 1976 Hay left Vermont and moved to Austin, Texas. Her attention focused on a set of practices (\"playing awake\") that engaged the performer on several levels of consciousness at once. While developing her concepts over the course of 15 years, she instituted a yearly four-month group workshop that culminated in large group public performances and from these group pieces she distilled her solo dances. Her second book, Lamb at the Altar: The Story of a Dance (Duke University Press, 1994), documents the unique creative process that defined these works.\r\n\r\nIn the late 1990’s Deborah Hay focused almost exclusively on rarified and enigmatic solo dances based on her new experimental choreographic method, such as The Man Who Grew Common in Wisdom, Voilà, The Other Side of O, Fire, Boom Boom Boom, Music, Beauty, The North Door, The Ridge, Room, performing them around the world and passing them on to noted performers in the US, Europe, and Australia. She also choreographed a duet for herself and Mikhail Baryshnikov, Single Duet, which toured with the Past/Forward project in 2000.\r\n\r\nHay’s work has now reached a new stage, where she redefines the inimitable choreographic method of her solo pieces in collaboration with highly trained dancers. In 2004 she received a NYC Bessie award for her choreography of the quartet The Match, which toured in Austin, Houston, London, Nottingham, Montpellier, and Paris in 2005.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 180, "image_id": 1768, "added": "2014-08-21T19:55:55", "slug": "bd2d3aa3971a3daa", "speakers": [{"id": 14913, "name": "Deborah Hay", "slug": "deborah-hay"}], "topics": [{"id": 2351, "name": "scotland", "path": "/arts/history/britain/scotland"}, {"id": 2676, "name": "dance", "path": "/arts/arts/education/dance"}, {"id": 1869, "name": "performance", "path": "/arts/film/videoart/performance"}, {"id": 3399, "name": "performance", "path": "/arts/art/contemporaryart/performance"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 1781, "name": "Independent Dance", "slug": "independent-dance", "city": "London", "postcode": "SE1 6ER"}, "organizer": {"id": 1781, "name": "Independent Dance", "slug": "independent-dance"}, "date": "2014-09-06", "dates": [{"id": 14454, "from_date": "2014-09-06", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "18:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Screening: £7/£5 (concessions) Talk: £10/£7 (concessions) Screening/talk joint offer: £14/£10 (conce", "ticket_info": "Please call Siobhan Davies reception on 020 7091 9650 or email info@independentdance.co.uk.", "additional_info": null, "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 1781, "name": "Independent Dance", "slug": "independent-dance", "city": "London", "postcode": "SE1 6ER"}, "organizer": {"id": 1781, "name": "Independent Dance", "slug": "independent-dance"}}]}, {"id": 13757, "title": "Re-greening the Arctic ", "synopsis": "What will the Arctic look like in the 2050’s?

Many intellectuals, writers, philosophers and journalists had preceded Bahari since the Iranian Revolution in 1979.

Art, genius and tradition", "synopsis": "Does looking back stop us looking forward? Where are today’s Schumanns – or do we even need any?", "keywords": "Art, Genius, Tradition", "body": "The German composer Robert Schumann praised the Polish composer Frederic Chopin’s early works, calling him a genius and lauding the music’s ‘intense nationalism’. But, Schumann wrote, ‘Art requires more. The minor interests of the soil on which he was born had to sacrifice themselves to the universal ones.’ And Chopin’s later works are indeed said to edge further and further towards this internationalist style. But can we think in terms of artistic universals today? Is greatness conceivable in local or national terms, or global ones? What are contemporary artists aiming to achieve, and is it for everyone?\r\n\r\nIt’s easy to look at the contemporary arts and bemoan a lack of greatness or ambition. How can we compare a light going on and off to a painting by Rembrandt? New classical music seems ghettoised and unappealing to the general public, and jazz is perhaps also shutting itself off from new audiences. But can we speak of a decline without endorsing a Schumannesque belief in universalism – if art has changed its scope, is this defeatism or progress? Furthermore, from where do artists themselves draw inspiration? Do the masterpieces of the canon inspire fresh work, or does their continual presence stifle creativity? Now that even avant-gardism seems to have run its course, are new works forever in a grim dialogue with the great remains of former, better artistic times?\r\n\r\nIn any case, Tate Modern audiences are growing ever higher, after all, and there is plenty of interest as well for ‘blockbuster’ exhibitions of past greats. But will the emerging artists today provoke the same level of reverence as their predecessors do today in coming centuries? And is it really the art of the past that we love so much, or the stories and mythology which surround them? Either way, there is no stopping efforts at broadening the artistic canon’s cultural reach, in music as much as visual art – from worldwide opera broadcasts from the Met, to Venezuela’s vaunted music programme El Sistema taking Western classical music as an agent for social change. Can we call efforts to bring the arts to all classes and cultures a noble sort of universalism – or is it just globalisation? Finally, what does it really mean to live in a world with such an obsession with the art of the past, in all its greatness? Does looking back stop us looking forward?

Yet with all of the changes, the future for Burma's stateless Rohingya community in the North Rakhine State--recognized as one of the most oppressed people in the world--has received little or no attention and remains one of the most sensitive issues not only in Burma but also in the SE Asia region. \r\n\r\nThis event corresponds to the photography exhibition and book launch of, 'Exiled To Nowhere: Burma's Rohingya' by Greg Constantine. It discusses the situation for the Rohingya in Burma, Bangladesh and beyond as well as how protracted statelessness, exclusion and the denial of citizenship and fundamental rights have impacted this community. \r\n\r\nGreg Constantine is a freelance photojournalist from the United States. Since early 2006, he has worked on one long-term project titled \"Nowhere People,\" which documents the struggles of stateless minority groups around the world.

His work has been widely published and exhibited and has been recognized with numerous awards. \r\n\r\nIn 2011, he was selected by the Open Society Institute for the group exhibition, Moving Walls 19 and he was shortlisted for the Amnesty International Media Award for Photojournalism in the UK. His first book, \"Kenya’s Nubians: Then & Now,\" was published in late 2011 and his second book, \"Exiled To Nowhere: Burma’s Rohingya,\" will be released in June 2012.

She previously worked as international advocacy officer for the Jesuit Refugee Service and has coordinated the International Coalition on the Detention of Refugees, Asylum Seekers and Migrants. She has worked as a human rights advocacy trainer in the Dominican Republic, where her focus was on the issue of statelessness. She has also worked as legal advisor to a local nongovernmental organization in the Solomon Islands combating domestic violence and child abuse.

While Nightingale believed in the value of education for nurses she was realistic about its aspirations, rejecting the notion that nurses could be educated in universities on the basis that there was insufficient knowledge in the nursing curriculum. She also argued against nursing being a ‘bookish’ business at the expense of practical supervision and the character of the nurse. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, Professor Rafferty will consider the strange ambivalence towards nurses being well educated, particularly in the university sector. 2013 will see the move towards a nursing degree as the entry level into practice. But have nurses become ‘too posh to wash’ and is education really the culprit in recent concerns about the quality of nursing care?

Administrator Rajiv Shah will discuss how fundamental reforms, coordinated approaches, and new U.S. Presidential initiatives on food security and global health are helping achieve more effective, cost-efficient, results-oriented development. \r\n\r\nDr Rajiv Shah was sworn in as the 16th Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) on December 31, 2009. USAID, a U.S. Government agency, has provided economic and humanitarian assistance worldwide for almost 50 years. \r\n\r\nPreviously, Dr Shah served as Under Secretary for Research, Education and Economics and as Chief Scientist at the U.S. Department of Agriculture, where he was responsible for safe, sustainable, competitive U.S. food and fiber system, as well as strong communities, families, and youth through integrated research, analysis, and education. At USDA, he launched the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, a new scientific institute that elevated the status and funding of agricultural research to be more in line with other major scientific groups. He also produced innovative initiatives in bio-energy, climate, global food security, child-hood obesity, and food safety. \r\n\r\nPrior to joining the Obama Administration, Shah served as director of Agricultural Development in the Global Development Program at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. In his seven years with the Gates Foundation, Shah served as the Foundation's director of Strategic Opportunities and as deputy director of policy and finance for the Global Health Program. In these roles, he helped develop and launch the foundation's Global Development Program, and helped create both the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa, and the International Finance Facility for Immunization-an effort that raised more than $5 billion for child immunization. \r\n\r\nPrior to joining the Gates Foundation in 2001, Shah was the health care policy advisor on the Gore 2000 presidential campaign and a member of Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell's transition committee on health. He is the co-founder of Health Systems Analytics and Project IMPACT for South Asian Americans. In addition, he has served as a policy aide in the British Parliament and worked at the World Health Organization.\r\nOriginally from Detroit, Michigan, Shah earned his M.D. from the University of Pennsylvania Medical School and his Master of Science in health economics at the Wharton School of Business. He has attended the London School of Economics, is a graduate of the University of Michigan, and has published articles on health policy and global development. Shah previously served on the boards of the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA), the Seattle Public Library, and the Seattle Community College District.

It is my overall argument that this is indeed the case and that the Malinowskian recourse to empirical evidence as the ultimate criterion for anthropological knowledge is misguided. Some phenomena dealt with by anthropologists are beyond empirical experience. As examples, I take two classical topics - the ‘soul’ and ‘ritual blood sacrifice’. I will show how both are essentially metaphysical issues, not empirical ones. Understanding them, therefore, is not a question of advancement in the actual material practice of fieldwork, but of the power of the scholar's speculative imagination. This finds an echo in Frazer, the last survivor of the old ‘armchair school’. His style of anthropology was marked by a deliberate speculative interrogation of ethnography - a process whereby abstract thinking gives force and meaning to ethnographic observations. \r\n\r\nDr Rane Willerslev has his PhD from the University of Cambridge (2003) and his MA in Visual Anthropology from the University of Manchester (1996). In 2006, he was awarded the ‘Young Elite Researcher’s Award’ by the Independent Research Councils of Denmark. Since 2007, Willerslev has been the editor of Acta Borealia: Nordic Journal of Circumpolar Societies. His main field of research has been hunting and spiritual knowledge among Siberia’s indigenous peoples. In 2007, his monograph Soul Hunters: Hunting, Animism and Personhood among the Siberian Yukaghirs was published by University of California Press, Berkeley and his popular book På flugt i Sibirien (On the Run in Siberia) was published by Gyldendal in 2009. From 2004-6, Willerslev was associate professor at the Granada Centre for Visual Anthropology in the Department for Social Anthropology at the University of Manchester and he is the author of several articles about vision and visuality. In 2006, he was appointed Associate Professor at the Institute for Anthropology, Archaeology and Linguistics, University of Aarhus. Since August 2008, he has been the director of the Ethnographic Collections at Moesgård Museum, Denmark. \r\n\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 60, "image_id": 732, "added": "2010-04-10T16:21:05", "slug": "068fe7fc39ac8af3", "speakers": [{"id": 9619, "name": "Dr Rane Willerslev ", "slug": "dr-rane-willerslev"}], "topics": [{"id": 348, "name": "anthropology", "path": "/academic/anthropology"}], "supercategory": "academic", "venue": {"id": 2131, "name": "Old Theatre", "slug": "old-theatre", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC2A 2AE"}, "organizer": {"id": 1287, "name": "London School of Economics & Political Science", "slug": "london-school-of-economics-political-science"}, "date": "2010-05-13", "dates": [{"id": 8547, "from_date": "2010-05-13", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "18:00:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": null, "additional_info": "This event is free and open to all with no ticket required.

We will also see how love is so closely linked with our heart…\r\nActivating our Heart…\r\nHeart is such an important and vital organ for us. It provides the power needed for life and it beats more than 2.5 billion times in an average life time without pausing to rest…Why is heart so closely linked to love and to spirituality? Join us this Saturday to discuss what is the relationship between our heart, love and spirituality…\r\nAbout Valentine…\r\nValentine’s Day is named after two Early Christian martyrs named Valentine, Valentine of Rome- a priest in Rome who was martyred about 269 AD and Valentine of Terni- a bishop of Interamna (Terni) who was martyred around 197 AD. Although their lives may have shown a strong devotion to God and living a life dedicated to spirituality, how did the lives of these two men turn into a remembrance of love? And how can our own life offer a remembrance of love by the very actions we live out?\r\nAbout The Workshop…\r\nDuring the workshop we will have the opportunity to try several spiritual practices to bring us in tune with our own heart and experience its wonderful benefits, such as peace, clarity, inner silence etc. Some of the practices we use in Gnosis which you will get the chance to explore is a mantra to help activate the heart chakra as well as various meditations on the heart, such as concentration on the heartbeats, concentration on the physical heart, concentration of the heart as a spiritual temple and as a forest…\r\nWhen?\r\nThe workshop will be on the 13th of  February Saturday 2PM- 4PM, at the Gnostic Centre-London.\r\nAs usual, there will be refreshments available in our Café area before and after the workshop.\r\n\r\nThe event is free of charge and you are all welcome!\r\n\r\nThe London Gnostic Centre\r\n\r\nContact name: Olga Kaniak\r\nEmail: london@gnosticmovement.com\r\nPhone: 020 77 01 69 00\r\nAddress: \r\nThe London Gnostic Centre\r\n59b Denmark Hill, Camberwell, London, SE5 8RS.\r\n\r\nThe London Gnostic Center is completely dedicated to bringing the connection of spiritual experiences to ordinary life.

Professor Simon Emmerson argues that with the right approach this can be seen as ‘humanising the technology’ and not the reverse. Technology may expand what music means, potentially leading us to deeper and richer experiences of the world, helping the world (and maybe beyond) to become a musical instrument.\r\n\r\nProfessor Simon Emmerson studied sciences at Cambridge before convincing his tutors he wanted to switch to music (through music education studies). He taught physics and music in a secondary school before gaining a PhD Studentship in Electronic Music at City University where he worked through to becoming professor. He is now Professor of Music, Technology and Innovation at De Montfort University. He has always composed with electronics, usually with instruments or voices and has two recent solo CDs on the Sargasso label. He has contributed to and edited The Language of Electroacoustic Music (Macmillan, 1986, still in print), Music, Electronic Media and Culture (Ashgate, 2000) and Living Electronic Music (Ashgate, 2007).

Despite the expose, however, T.Lobsang Rampa went on to write twenty three other books, and has the distinction of being the most widely-read twentieth-century author on Tibetan mysticism.\r\n\r\nIn this lecture, Phil Hine examines the affair of the so-called “Bogus Lama”. From the initial reception of The Third Eye to the scholarly response and detective story which led to the exposure of Lobsang Rampa in the media. He will discuss Rampa’s relationship to the imagining of Tibet as a mystical Shangri-La and his influence of modern occulture in general. He will also look at key features of Lobsang Rampa’s teachings and his unique approach to the presentation of occult knowledge.\r\n\r\nIf you’re one of the estimated 15 million people who’ve read one of Lobsang Rampa’s books, or have an interest in the representation of Tibet in modern occultism, then this talk is for you.\r\n\r\nTonight's speaker, Phil Hine, is a magician with a strong interest in examining occultism as a cultural formation and in looking at its relationship with other discursive constructions.

Whilst his most well-known works are on chaos magic, his research over the past few years has concentrated on the reception and reformulations of South Asian philosophies in the West, from Tantra to Theosophy.

Are the changes fundamental or just technology substitution ?\" \r\n\r\nTony’s interest in photography and imaging started at the age of 11 with his parent's Kodak Brownie 127 camera.

The expected gains were, however, abruptly thwarted by the AIDS pandemic and by government policy, but this only temporarily halted the push for queer freedom. \r\n\r\nThe homophobic backlash of the 1980s produced a defiance and radicalism that paved the way for all the eventual gains of the last few years.\r\n\r\nh3.
