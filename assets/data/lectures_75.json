The book launch will include a talk by Professor Stone, followed by a reception with light refreshments.\r\n\r\nConcentration camps are a relatively new invention, a recurring feature of twentieth century warfare, and one that is important to the modern global consciousness and identity. Although the most famous concentration camps are those under the Nazis, the use of concentration camps originated several decades before the Third Reich, in the Philippines and in the Boer War, and they have been used again in numerous locations, not least during the genocide in Bosnia. They have become defining symbols of humankind's lowest point and basest acts.\r\n\r\nIn this book, Dan Stone gives a global history of concentration camps, and shows that it is not only \"mad dictators\" who have set up camps, but instead all varieties of states, including liberal democracies, that have made use of them. Setting concentration camps against the longer history of incarceration, he explains how the ability of the modern state to control populations led to the creation of this extreme institution. Looking at their emergence and spread around the world, Stone argues that concentration camps serve the purpose, from the point of view of the state in crisis, of removing a section of the population that is perceived to be threatening, traitorous, or diseased. Drawing on contemporary accounts of camps, as well as the philosophical literature surrounding them, Stone considers the story camps tell us about the nature of the modern world as well as about specific regimes.\r\n\r\nDan Stone is Professor of Modern History at Royal Holloway, University of London, where he is also Director of the Holocaust Research Centre. He is the author or editor of sixteen books, including Histories of the Holocaust (OUP, 2010) and The Liberation of the Camps: The End of the Holocaust and its Aftermath (Yale, 2015), and some seventy scholarly articles.

None of the six safety systems designed to contain such a leak were operational, allowing the gas to spread throughout the city of Bhopal. Half a million people were exposed to the gas and 25,000 have died to date as a result of their exposure. More than 120,000 people still suffer from ailments caused by the accident and the subsequent pollution at the plant site.\r\n\r\nThe first part of the project depicts the entire boundary wall of Union Carbide, the disaster site. Supposedly creating a barrier between what is safe, and what is not, the images expose the level of the walls degradation, which allows easy access to toxins harmful to human health and the environment. There are cavernous holes in the wall at ground level, steps and ledges that lead up and over the wall, security gates left open, parts where the wall is only knee high. The perimeter wall has rows and rows of residents’ houses backing on to it. Children clamber over the wall or pass through the holes – getting to what appears an appealing grassy spot for a game of cricket. Photographed from a child’s height, who cannot see the dangers of the abandoned factory within, each image of the wall joins the next, forming a continuum when presented.\r\n\r\nWhilst the wall represents 30 years of pain and suffering, the residents surrounding the contaminated site appeared to be resilient and optimistic. To reflect this perception, the wall is presented with a series of formal family portraits of the people who live in the slums that surround the disaster site. The portraits reference the traditional Indian studio portraits usually acquired by wealthy higher castes, and given the opportunity, the people of Bhopal could register their own dignity, values and resilience through the medium of the family portrait.\r\n\r\nThe people of Bhopal are not victims as a result of their own actions, or simply through poverty; they were subject to a system that facilitated the economic growth of a multinational company, at the expense of life and the environment – as if less important or disposable.

Best known for his 'Southwark Mysteries', his style has been described in 'Time Out' as 'like Shakespeare on acid'. The poems in this book encompass political satires and magical realist lyrics. In the line of Blake, they reveal the eternal, spiritual forms of our transitory, material world, celebrating the dynamic interplay of Contraries to challenge rigid belief-systems.\r\n\r\nThis transforming vision in action, as exemplified in ‘The Southwark Mysteries’ and in the later ‘Cross Bones’ poems, illuminates Constable's work as the urban shaman John Crow. In ‘Winchester Cathedral: Time Out Of Mind’, different ages, perspectives and literary styles collide to evoke a complex, and deeply conflicted, sense of place.\r\n\r\nThe other prose poem, ‘Wennefer’, is an hallucinatory, visceral, cautionary tale, retelling the Isis and Osiris myth in contemporary south London club culture.\r\n\r\n'Past and present, sacred and profane jostle and collide in a glorious tumult... couched in verse that is muscular, ribald, and often dazzlingly rich...' The Times\r\n\r\n'Blakean verse that resonates with modern life...' Freedom\r\n\r\n'Like Shakespeare on acid...' Time Out\r\n\r\nThis event is part of Housmans' 'London's Burning' season, which explores the capital's radical past, present and future.\r\n\r\nAbout the author:\r\n\r\nJohn Constable is a poet, playwright, performer and purveyor of unusual walks. ‘The Southwark Mysteries’, his cycle of poems and contemporary Mystery Plays, was performed in Shakespeare's Globe and Southwark Cathedral.\r\n\r\nHis stage adaptation of ‘Gormenghast’, his ‘Sha-Manic Plays’, ‘The Southwark Mysteries’ and ‘Secret Bankside –Walks In The Outlaw Borough’ are all published by Oberon Books.  His Radio 4 dramatisations of ‘The Kraken Wakes’ and ‘Chocky’ were released as BBC Audiobooks. His solo work includes ‘I Was An Alien Sex God’ and ‘SPARE’.\r\n\r\nIn his John Crow persona, he has conducted ritual dramas and vigils at Cross Bones cemetery in Southwark, where he has established a shrine and a garden of remembrance to 'honour the outcast'.

Recent years have seen a panic over “online red light districts,” which supposedly seduce vulnerable young women into a life of degradation. But rarely do these fearful, salacious dispatches come from sex workers themselves, and rarely do they deviate from the position that sex workers must be rescued from their condition, and the industry simply abolished—a position common among feminists and conservatives alike.  In Playing the Wh***: The Work of Sex Work ((Verso, 2014), journalist Melissa Gira Grant challenges the myths about selling sex and those who perpetuate them.

Over the past five centuries, a rotating cast of kings and conquerors, presidents and dictators have set their sights on the European heartland, desperate to seize this pivotal area or at least prevent it from falling into the wrong hands.  From Charles V and Napoleon to Bismarck and Cromwell, from Hitler and Stalin to Roosevelt, Gorbachev and the achitects of the European Union nearly all the key power players of modern history have staked their titanic visions on this vital swath of land. \r\n\r\nIn Europe, Brendan Simms presents an authoritative account of the past half-millennium of European history, demonstrating how the battle for mastery there has shaped the modern world. Beginning in 1453, when the collapse of the Byzantine Empire laid Europe open to Ottoman incursion and prompted the attempted reform of the Holy Roman Empire, Simms leads readers through the epic struggle for the heart of Europe. Stretching from the Low Countries through Germany and into the North Italian plain, this relatively compact zone has historically been the richest and most productive on earth. For hundreds of years, its crucial strategic importance stoked a seemingly unending series of conflicts, from the English Civil War to the French Revolution to the appalling world wars of the 20th century. But when Europe is in harmony, Simms shows, the entire world benefits—a lesson that current leaders would do well to remember. \r\n\r\nA bold and compelling work by a renowned scholar, Europe integrates religion, politics, military strategy, and international relations to show how history—and the West itself—was forged in the crucible of Europe.\r\n\r\nBrendan Simms is professor of the history of international relations at the University of Cambridge.", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 732, "added": "2013-09-12T05:48:58", "slug": "130c782a664fe620", "speakers": [{"id": 14057, "name": "Professor  Brendan  Simms", "slug": "professor-brendan-simms"}], "topics": [{"id": 2940, "name": "europe", "path": "/academic/history/european/history/earlymoderneuropeanhistory/eu"}, {"id": 3528, "name": "war", "path": "/academic/history/european/history/war"}, {"id": 106, "name": "wwi", "path": "/arts/books/history/military/wwi"}], "supercategory": "academic", "venue": {"id": 2796, "name": "Sheikh Zayed Theatre (New Academic Building, LSE)", "slug": "sheikh-zayed-theatre-new-academic-building-lse", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC2A 3LJ"}, "organizer": {"id": 1287, "name": "London School of Economics & Political Science", "slug": "london-school-of-economics-political-science"}, "date": "2013-11-12", "dates": [{"id": 13494, "from_date": "2013-11-12", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "18:30:00", "ticket_cost": "FREE", "ticket_info": "This event is free and open to all with no ticket required.

By the year 2008, India was the fourth largest economy in the world in purchasing power parity terms. For a nation that once believed that the ‘Hindu rate of growth’ was its destiny, this remarkable growth performance became a trigger for setting off aspirations for double-digit growth.\r\n\r\nThose aspirations have moderated significantly with growth moderating below trend in the post-crisis period owing to the impact of the global downturn as also a host of domestic policy and operational bottlenecks. The post-crisis period has also been characterized by a large fiscal deficit, historically high current account deficit and inflation persisting above the comfort level. Macroeconomic management during this period has had to contend with balancing between stimulating growth and reining in inflation, dealing with the short-term pressures in external sector without compromising long-term sustainability and returning to a path of fiscal responsibility.\r\n\r\nDr Subbarao, governor of the Reserve Bank of India will reflect on these challenges from the Reserve Bank perspective and illustrate the dilemmas encountered in making policy choices. \r\n\r\nDr Duvvuri Subbarao assumed office as the twenty-second governor of the Reserve Bank of India on 5 September 2008. Prior to this appointment, Dr Subbarao served as finance secretary to the Government of India from April 2007 to September 2008 and as secretary to the Prime Minister’s Economic Advisory Council from March 2005 to March 2007, and was a lead economist in the World Bank (1999 - 2004). Dr Subbarao came into the Reserve Bank just a week before the global financial crisis erupted in full in mid-September 2008. He led the Reserve Bank’s effort to mitigate the impact of the crisis on India and was actively engaged in the G-20 effort to coordinate an international response to the crisis. \r\n\r\nSuggested hashtag for this event for Twitter users: #LSEIndia \r\n\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 732, "added": "2013-02-15T13:21:34", "slug": "1cc8f11afeb1b4f5", "speakers": [{"id": 13469, "name": "Dr Duvvuri  Subbarao", "slug": "dr-duvvuri-subbarao"}, {"id": 5620, "name": "Professor Meghnad Desai", "slug": "professor-meghnad-desai"}], "topics": [{"id": 3346, "name": "india", "path": "/politics/economics/macroeconomics/india"}], "supercategory": "politics", "venue": {"id": 2113, "name": "Sheikh Zayed Theatre", "slug": "sheikh-zayed-theatre", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC2A 2AE"}, "organizer": {"id": 1287, "name": "London School of Economics & Political Science", "slug": "london-school-of-economics-political-science"}, "date": "2013-03-13", "dates": [{"id": 12631, "from_date": "2013-03-13", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "14:30:00", "ticket_cost": "FREE", "ticket_info": "This event is free and open to all however a ticket is required, only one ticket per person can be requested.\r\n\r\nMembers of the public, LSE staff, students and alumni can request one ticket via the online ticket request form which will be live on this listing after 10pm on Monday 4 March until at least 12noon on Tuesday 5 March.

Central to the Parasol unit philosophy is a total commitment to artists and their creative endeavour, an attitude which leads to a singular relationship developing between each exhibiting artist and the foundation.\r\nEvery year the foundation organises four challenging and thought-provoking exhibitions of works in various media by contemporary artists, and also sets up a variety of other artistic projects. Each exhibition is accompanied by a publication and related educational events. The foundation does not bear the founder’s name, and its exhibitions are not derived from the founder’s collection. Admission to exhibitions is free of charge.\r\nParasol unit operates like publicly funded institutions in London. Currently 58% of the funding is provided by the founder and 42% through Gift Aid, charitable organisations, private donations and the sale of merchandise. The exhibition space has been put at the disposal of the foundation free of charge by the founder. Thanks to this new model between private funding and public support one of London’s most vibrant contemporary art spaces has come to exist. \r\n\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 60, "image_id": null, "added": "2012-03-01T16:29:10", "slug": "artist-talk-helene-appel-in-conversation-with-oliver-basciano", "speakers": [{"id": 12092, "name": "Mr Oliver Basciano ", "slug": "mr-oliver-basciano"}], "topics": [{"id": 2845, "name": "installationart", "path": "/arts/interactivesculpture/installationart"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 1887, "name": "Parasol unit", "slug": "parasol-unit", "city": "London", "postcode": "N1 7RW"}, "organizer": {"id": 1887, "name": "Parasol unit", "slug": "parasol-unit"}, "date": "2012-03-02", "dates": [{"id": 11293, "from_date": "2012-03-02", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "19:00:00", "ticket_cost": "£5/£4 concessions", "ticket_info": "Payment: To secure your place payment can be made via phone (020 7490 7373), email (events@parasol-unit.org) or paypal (www.parasol-unit.org, please go to the events tab on the left)\r\n", "additional_info": "Event Booking Information\r\nBooking is recommended for all events to avoid disappointment.", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 1887, "name": "Parasol unit", "slug": "parasol-unit", "city": "London", "postcode": "N1 7RW"}, "organizer": {"id": 1887, "name": "Parasol unit", "slug": "parasol-unit"}}]}, {"id": 10846, "title": "Anglo Saxon Paganism: Texts, Rites, and Contemporary Practice", "synopsis": "Anglo Saxon Pagan practices and beliefs inspire contemporary heathens/pagans.", "keywords": "pagan occult anglo-saxon heathen", "body": "Anglo Saxon Pagan practices and beliefs inspire contemporary heathens/pagans, and in this lecture Pete Jennings talks about the sources (textual, archaeological) which are drawn upon -- and talks as well about how the ways people (including himself) are inspired by them.

Dave is venal, sexually predatory, but ultimately conformist, whereas Alec is intellectually alert and kind-hearted, but suffers from a lack of familial security – which he later finds with Olive. By the end Alec has discovered his voice and mission in revolutionary politics, and this new-found passion sweeps the novel to its conclusion.\r\nThe world portrayed here is truly unremitting. The factory scenes are brilliantly done, bringing to life the reality of sweatshops and sweated labour, and vividly portraying the exhaustion produced by long hours, unforgiving deadlines and cut-throat competition. \r\n\r\nCritics praised the warmth and colour of the scenes from Jewish life which were new to them – the synagogue wedding, the rituals of Yom Kippur, the concert evenings, the cafes and restaurants, street markets – even if at times the political message seemed too assertive for middlebrow Britain.

The thing families wanted most was for more for young people to do. Joblessness among low-skilled young people is extremely high in East London and other poor areas. Employers lose confidence and look for more highly qualified, more experienced and more privileged recruits, creating a vicious cycle for young people from troubled neighbourhoods. Families strive hard for their children, but young people need support. \r\n\r\nParents told us what helps most and what works best. They explained what pushes families over the brink.

Most people brought to trial after the riots came from highly disadvantaged and fragmented urban communities. \r\n\r\nIain Duncan Smith, Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, will talk about the importance of families to society; and explain how we can create better futures for our most disadvantaged children. Education, Sure Start for all ages, crime prevention, job training, outdoor space and youth activities all build community resilience. \r\n\r\nProfessor Jane Waldfogel from Columbia University, a specialist in family and child poverty will respond. \r\n\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 732, "added": "2011-10-09T12:46:23", "slug": "c38ddf831994f275", "speakers": [{"id": 5301, "name": "Professor Sir John Hills", "slug": "professor-sir-john-hills"}, {"id": 11669, "name": "Mr Ian Duncan Smith", "slug": "mr-ian-duncan-smith"}, {"id": 11670, "name": "Professor Jane Waldfogel", "slug": "professor-jane-waldfogel"}], "topics": [{"id": 1947, "name": "social", "path": "/society/social"}], "supercategory": "society", "venue": {"id": 2277, "name": "LSE Campus, venue TBC to ticket holders", "slug": "lse-campus-venue-tbc-to-ticket-holders", "city": "London ", "postcode": "WC2A 2AE"}, "organizer": {"id": 1287, "name": "London School of Economics & Political Science", "slug": "london-school-of-economics-political-science"}, "date": "2011-12-01", "dates": [{"id": 10715, "from_date": "2011-12-01", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "18:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": "This event is free and open to all however a ticket is required.

By inverting this practice and employing bacteria as an external light source; objects and bodies, surfaces and skin were exposed to the blue green, ethereal glow of the living bacteria, establishing new points of contact and visual punctures. What is usually seen under the lens of the microscope is the source of light that reveals the features of human bodies. The images restage the long exposure of the camera lens in the improbable and at times disquieting bioluminescence that gradually fades as the bacteria die. Brodie’s lens quietly captures the ineffableness of life’s formation and the fleeting reality of subjectivity. In her photographs, the air is black but not because it is night. The hour does not matter. Bodies are exposed as if on a laboratory slide.\r\n\r\nThe project began in 2008 in a purpose made ‘bioluminescent photographic booth’ in a cupboard behind the Lecture theatre at the Royal Institution, with photographic portraits of the staff of the Ri and eminent professors including Lord Krebs, Richard Ashcroft, Marcus Du Sautoy, Chris Mason and Christopher Rapley.

Often subconsciously artists are drawn to the same structures that fascinate mathematicians.

Essential for her artistic research are methods such as appropriation, repetition and collage, as well as acting out such different roles as: hacker, cyberfeminist, researcher, activist, entrepreneur, thief, peeper or trick-  shot artist. Her continuous questioning of traditional models of authorship and originality determines Sollfrank’s conflictual – and productive – relationship to copyright and concepts of intellectual property. This book, with essays by Sabine Himmelsbach, Jacob Lillemose, Silke Wenk, Rahel Puffert, Gerald Raunig and Cornelia Sollfrank, gathers recent projects by the German artist, including the Internet-  based software Déjà Vu: First Plagiarism Detection Software for Fine Arts, developed especially for the Edith Russ Site for Media Art.

Language is the main channel in which human beings share the contents of their consciousness. It thereby offers a window into human nature, revealing the hidden workings of our thoughts, our emotions, and our social relationships. Pinker explores an example of each: everyday metaphor as a window into human cognition; swearing and taboo words as a window into human emotion; and indirect speech-veiled threats and bribes, polite requests, and sexual come-ons-as a window into human relationships. And, with this book, he also shows just how stimulating and entertaining language can be.\r\n\r\nSteven Pinker is the Johnstone Family Professor in the Department of Psychology at Harvard University.

It begins by exploring what is meant by utopia, the tension between what is desirable and what is possible, and the quest for fulfillment that lies at utopia's core, figured as 'looking for the blue'. Against this must be set the fear of utopia, that attempts at its imposition will lead to inevitable failure or totalitarianism. However, this fear and/or danger arises principally from the treatment of utopia as goal, rather than as method. Its power as method can be illustrated by application to contemporary politics, in the idea of the 'inclusive society', the quest to 'make poverty history', and the need for a more sustainable future. The positive power of utopia rests not only in the representation of the world 'otherwise' but on the treatment of that imaginary reconstitution of society as a provisional, reflexive, and dialogic exploration of future possibilities. The lecture is accompanied by photographic and musical illustration. \r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 60, "image_id": null, "added": "2007-06-01T16:43:53", "slug": "5b1da136df60f5ea", "speakers": [{"id": 5410, "name": "Professor Ruth Levitas", "slug": "professor-ruth-levitas"}], "topics": [{"id": 170, "name": "newtopic", "path": "/science/chemistry/biochemistry/catalysis/newtopic"}, {"id": 687, "name": "society", "path": "/arts/architecture/planning/society"}, {"id": 1024, "name": "society", "path": "/arts/literature/french/society"}, {"id": 123, "name": "mobility", "path": "/society/urbanisation/planning/mobility"}], "supercategory": "science", "venue": {"id": 1327, "name": "University of Kent", "slug": "university-of-kent", "city": "Canterbury", "postcode": "CT2 7NZ"}, "organizer": {"id": 1321, "name": "AHRC Centre for Law, Gender and Sexuality", "slug": "ahrc-centre-for-law-gender-and-sexuality"}, "date": "2007-05-02", "dates": [{"id": 4460, "from_date": "2007-05-02", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "18:00:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": null, "additional_info": "Followed by a drinks reception", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 1327, "name": "University of Kent", "slug": "university-of-kent", "city": "Canterbury", "postcode": "CT2 7NZ"}, "organizer": {"id": 1321, "name": "AHRC Centre for Law, Gender and Sexuality", "slug": "ahrc-centre-for-law-gender-and-sexuality"}}]}, {"id": 4280, "title": "The Poetry Show", "synopsis": "An evening of poetry with the Performer Poets.", "keywords": "Poetry\r\nTheatre", "body": "Through their own poetry, the Performer Poets take an audience on an \r\nemotional and uplifting journey into past relationships, lost love, a second world war childhood, the torments of clinical despair and confinement, and back out into joy and laughter.
