Wild animal translocations alter host-parasite encounters in the destination environment because each translocated animal represents a biological package of the host and their parasites.  Research and observational studies show that changes in host-parasite relations affect the risk of epidemic disease outbreaks in natural ecosystems.  Stressors acting on wild animals during transport, or during captive rearing, influence the pathogenicity of commensal parasites through immune-suppression.  In addition, non-infectious hazards, such as toxins, have detrimental effects on translocated populations post release.  Difficulties in predicting the risks from disease stem from our poor understanding of the identity, number, distribution and pathogenicity of parasites, and inadequate knowledge of the degree of exposure to non-infectious hazards.  Making decisions about disease risk management where there is poor knowledge often requires risk evaluation by experts to help inform decision makers in a transparent and defendable way.\r\n\r\nThis two-day symposium will review the impact of disease on species restoration through translocation, and consider lessons learned to guide effective planning and implementation of future translocation projects. Health management of conservation interventions will be discussed, including methods of disease-risk analysis, evaluation of disease management alternatives, use of molecular tools to unravel disease risks, mitigation of diseases and methods for post-release health monitoring.\r\n\r\nOrganised by Tony Sainsbury (ZSL), Katherine Walsh (Natural England), Ian Carter (Natural England), John Ewen (ZSL), Matt Hartley (RSPB).", "additional_info": null, "duration": 480, "image_id": null, "added": "2014-08-21T19:53:33", "slug": "4f5d4e5335508ae8", "speakers": [{"id": 14944, "name": "Tony Sainsbury", "slug": "tony-sainsbury"}], "topics": [{"id": 1068, "name": "disease", "path": "/science/genetics/chromosomes/disease"}, {"id": 1826, "name": "disease", "path": "/science/biology/microbiology/disease"}, {"id": 2031, "name": "england", "path": "/politics/history/europe/england"}, {"id": 2916, "name": "england", "path": "/arts/photography/photojournalism/england"}], "supercategory": "science", "venue": {"id": 2612, "name": "Huxley Lecture Theatre", "slug": "huxley-lecture-theatre", "city": "London", "postcode": "NW1 4RY"}, "organizer": {"id": 2612, "name": "Huxley Lecture Theatre", "slug": "huxley-lecture-theatre"}, "date": "2015-05-14", "dates": [{"id": 14463, "from_date": "2015-05-14", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "9:00:00", "ticket_cost": "£50-£150", "ticket_info": "http://www.zsl.org/science/whats-on/health-and-disease-in-translocated-wild-animals", "additional_info": "Discounts are applicable for Students, Members and Fellows.\r\n\r\nFor further information, please contact the Scientific Events Coordinator by emailing linda.davolls@zsl.org, or 0207 449 6272.", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 2612, "name": "Huxley Lecture Theatre", "slug": "huxley-lecture-theatre", "city": "London", "postcode": "NW1 4RY"}, "organizer": {"id": 2612, "name": "Huxley Lecture Theatre", "slug": "huxley-lecture-theatre"}}]}, {"id": 13929, "title": "The End of Authenticity: Artworks in the age of perfect replication", "synopsis": "What happens to notions of originality and uniqueness in artworks, as the advance of 3D printing brings us closer to an era of perfect replication?", "keywords": "visual culture,  art, 3d printing, bitcoin, technology, aesthetics, economics", "body": "Will scarcity lose its salience?

What accounts for the difference?\r\n\r\nThe key is the amount of inequality in each society. The picture is consistent whether we compare rich countries or the 50 states of the USA.  The more unequal a society is, the more ill health and social problems it has. \r\n\r\nInequality has always been regarded as divisive and socially corrosive.  The data show that even small differences in the amount of inequality matter.  Material inequality serves as a determinant of the scale and importance of social stratification. It increases status insecurity and competition and the prevalence of all the problems associated with relative deprivation. Particularly important are effects mediated by social status, friendship and early childhood experience. However, although the amount of inequality has its greatest effect on rates of problems among the poor, its influence extends to almost all income groups: too much inequality reduces levels of well-being among the vast majority of the population. \r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 120, "image_id": 1755, "added": "2012-09-22T11:59:43", "slug": "holyoake-lecture-inequality-the-enemy-between-us", "speakers": [{"id": 12700, "name": "Professor Kate  Pickett", "slug": "professor-kate-pickett"}, {"id": 6156, "name": "Mr Richard Wilkinson", "slug": "mr-richard-wilkinson"}], "topics": [{"id": 1024, "name": "society", "path": "/arts/literature/french/society"}, {"id": 687, "name": "society", "path": "/arts/architecture/planning/society"}, {"id": 2687, "name": "society", "path": "/arts/literature/writing/society"}, {"id": 123, "name": "mobility", "path": "/society/urbanisation/planning/mobility"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 2732, "name": "Friends Meeting House Main Hall", "slug": "friends-meeting-house-main-hall", "city": "Manchester", "postcode": "M2 5NS"}, "organizer": {"id": 1832, "name": "British Humanist Association", "slug": "british-humanist-association"}, "date": "2012-10-16", "dates": [{"id": 11834, "from_date": "2012-10-16", "to_date": "2012-10-16", "time": "18:30:00", "ticket_cost": "£7 general, £5 BHA and GMH members, and students", "ticket_info": null, "additional_info": null, "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 2732, "name": "Friends Meeting House Main Hall", "slug": "friends-meeting-house-main-hall", "city": "Manchester", "postcode": "M2 5NS"}, "organizer": {"id": 1832, "name": "British Humanist Association", "slug": "british-humanist-association"}}]}, {"id": 10817, "title": "THE GARDEN OF EARTHLY DELIGHTS: MEDIEVAL GARDENS AND THEIR MEANINGS / PARADISE REGAINED", "synopsis": "The garden in medieval Europe was more than just a space where nature was cultivated and enjoyed.

Most people feel uneasy about markets in sexual or reproductive services, and though there is a substantial global trade in body tissues, the illicit trade in live human organs is widely condemned. But what, if any, is the problem with treating bodies as resources and/or possessions? Is there something about the body that makes it particularly inappropriate to apply to it the language of property, commodities, and things? Or is thinking the body special a kind of sentimentalism that blocks clear thinking about matters such as prostitution, surrogate motherhood, or the sale of spare kidneys? \r\n\r\nThe related question is whether there is something about feminism that makes it particularly resistant to the body as property. The critique of objectification suggests there is, but there is also an influential strand that defends the commodification of sexual and reproductive services and queries the idea of the body as special. In this lecture, Anne Phillips defends the idea that the body is special, but argues that debates about body ownership are best understood as debates about market relations, not simply claims about the body per se. \r\n\r\nAnne Phillips joined the LSE in 1999 as Professor of Gender Theory, and was Director of the Gender Institute until September 2004. She subsequently moved to a joint appointment between the Gender Institute and Government Department. She is a leading figure in feminist political theory, and writes on issues of democracy and representation, equality, multiculturalism, and difference. Much of her work can be read as challenging the narrowness of contemporary liberal theory. \r\n\r\nIn 1992, she was co-winner of the American Political Science Association's Victoria Schuck Award for Best Book on Women and Politics published in 1991 (awarded for Engendering Democracy). She was awarded an honorary Doctorate from the University of Aalborg in 1999; was appointed Adjunct Professor in the Political Science Programme of the Research School of Social Sciences, Australian National University, 2002-6; and was elected a Fellow of the British Academy in 2003.  In 2008, she received a Special Recognition Award from the Political Studies Association, UK, for her contribution to Political Studies. Her latest book is Gender & Culture, published in April 2010. \r\n\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 732, "added": "2010-09-02T12:51:33", "slug": "fe3499d2df4281f0", "speakers": [{"id": 6622, "name": "Professor Anne Phillips", "slug": "professor-anne-phillips"}, {"id": 6417, "name": "Chair: Professor Emily Jackson", "slug": "chair-professor-emily-jackson"}], "topics": [{"id": 1513, "name": "gender", "path": "/academic/society/gender"}, {"id": 1614, "name": "feminism", "path": "/arts/literature/feminism"}, {"id": 1718, "name": "feminism", "path": "/society/gender/feminism"}, {"id": 1777, "name": "gender", "path": "/academic/history/gender"}], "supercategory": "academic", "venue": {"id": 2131, "name": "Old Theatre", "slug": "old-theatre", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC2A 2AE"}, "organizer": {"id": 1287, "name": "London School of Economics & Political Science", "slug": "london-school-of-economics-political-science"}, "date": "2010-09-29", "dates": [{"id": 9095, "from_date": "2010-09-29", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "18:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": "This event is free and open to all with no ticket required.

Find out how one religion addressed these paradoxes. Tonight, Jonathan Hill takes us on a journey through the formation of Christian mysticism, as it struggled towards a place of acceptability, despite its inherent dangers and un-christian roots. The site of the ideas in the talk is the Mediterranean in the first centuries after Christ, and our speaker first shows us the influences upon Christians provided by the pagans, by the Jews and (deep breath!) the Gnostics.  We are taken through the developments in Christian mysticism in Alexandria, before turning to very different ideas that were being worked out by the thinkers in the mountains of Cappadocia amongst the Arian heretics. Jonathan concludes his talk with the synthesis of Christian mysticism provided by Pseudo-Dionysius, where some of the paradoxes of mysticism seem to be satisfactorily resolved. Or are they?\r\n\r\nThis a lecture of ideas about spiritual experience, and will provide rich food for thought for people from any tradition. If you are interested in ways of interpreting mystical or magical experience, you will find much to learn from what the Christians struggled with in their early days.  The discussion after the talk will encourage comparisons from modern traditions such as Thelema, Wicca, Sufism, Western Mysteries and other paths to which members of the audience may belong.\r\n\r\nJonathan Hill is a lively and gifted speaker with a fondness for making “big questions” of religion and mysticism accessible to the non-specialist. He is the author of five books focusing on church history and theology. He studied philosophy and theology as an undergraduate at Oxford, from where he also received an M.Phil. in theology (writing on Gregory of Nyssa). After several years in “the real world” of publishing and broadcasting, he escaped again and is now finishing a Ph.D. in philosophy from Singapore, his dissertation being on Leibniz.

He is former high commissioner of Pakistan to Great Britain, and has advised Prince Charles and met with President George W. Bush on Islam. His numerous books, films and documentaries have won prestigious awards and his books have been translated into several languages including Chinese and Indonesian. He is also a senior fellow at The Case Foundation in Washington, D.C. He spoke at the Chairman’s Distinguished Speakers Lecture Series at the Pentagon and gave the inaugural lecture for the first Chair in Jewish-Muslim Studies at the University of Illinois-Chicago. Akbar Ahmed is the principal investigator for the \"Islam in the Age of Globalization\" project, sponsored by the Brookings Institution, American University and the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life.
