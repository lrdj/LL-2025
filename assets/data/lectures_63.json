How do Jews respond and attempt to re-shape their images, stereotyped by the majority societies surrounding them? How does Jewish material culture them?

The ubiquitous associations between Rome and Stone are a common aspect of scholarly discussion surrounding these buildings and structures. Building on these established understandings of symbolic significance and material importance, this paper moves from the macro context of stone, that traditionally shapes the identity of these ecclesial structures, to a more micro encounter with their sacred spaces – looking at their surfaces, thresholds and coverings; at the extant materials that provide an immediate encounter for those viewing them in a contemporary context, but also considering those adornments now only perceived in textural accounts to consider in detail the material identities, forms and concepts that shaped sacred spaces in Anglo-Saxon England. These complex material identities and understandings rooted in socio-political contexts were widely borrowed by the Church to construct its specific identity and they contained echoic and deliberate resonances with materials of past sacred structures and the envisioned eschatological site of the heavenly kingdom to come, carrying significances across time and space.Speaker\r\nDr Meg Boulton graduates from the University of York in 2013 after completing her AHRC-funded PhD on the conceptualisation of sacred space in Anglo-Saxon Northumbria from the 6th-9th centuries, working with Professor Jane Hawkes.

There are several streets in Newport named after the Firbanks. A homosexual fop and eccentric Ronnie’s mother was descended from the Earls of Lucan ( of the nanny murder fame). Ronnie lived the latter part of his madcap life in London, and touring the bohemians quarters of North Africa and Europe to inspire his writing. His books are now cult classics, the covers also carry rare designs by the artists Keith Vaughan and Andy Warhol, both devotees of Firbank. Ronnie at his best includes some of the funniest, but most brutal caricatures of his contemporaries that roamed in the likes of the Café Royal and posh London hotels. Ronald Firbank died suddenly in Rome in 1926. The death created a story script that is as farcical and warped as any of Ronnie’s books with his internment alongside John Keats and Percy B Shelley in Rome’s Protestant Cemetery. This act was only to be met with horror from Ronnie’s odd ball sister Heather, who pointed out that Ronnie was in fact a Catholic. He was exhumed but could not be buried quickly as the famous Campo Verano Catholic Cemetery in Rome was still planning a space for non Roman Europeans who died in the City. After lying abandoned in a crypt for 8 months ultimately Ronnie was laid to rest , but his grave was overlooked and neglected for 80 years. William Cross ( and his co-writer Monty Dart ) have spent several years cleaning up Ronnie’s grave.

While this was true, Cohen provides an alternative narrative to the post-Holocaust picture of survivors’ renewal. She argues that many postwar Jewish families were built on the remnants of ruptured ones: widowed parents who remarried and became blended families of survivors that included children born before or during the war. What did this mean to child survivors who found themselves in new reconfigured groups composed of two-generations of survivors now under one roof? Synthesizing oral testimonies and archival documents, Cohen’s talk will highlight the complexity and long-lasting repercussions of rebuilt families from the children’s perspective.\r\n\r\nBeth B. Cohen received her Master’s Degree in psychology from Harvard University and her Ph.D. in Holocaust History from Clark University.

Yet governments, central banks and politicians have been unable to deal with it because conventional economics lacks any insight into the relationship between money, interest and debt.\r\nContrary to the insights of the great thinkers from Aristotle to Marx and Keynes, money is passive, with no impact on inflation, output or employment and banks simply lend money deposited by savers. In reality, however, money is not a thing but a social institution or a legal relationship, a set of tokens, deriving value from its being accepted by the state in settlement of taxes.\r\nThe cause of the crisis, correctly identified by Adair Turner of the FSA, lies with unrestrained credit creation by banks. Virtually all our money supply originates as debt in the form of interest bearing loans created out of nothing, that is, without any supporting collateral such as savings or government bonds. In the absence of controls, debt expands exponentially to the point where it exceeds capacity to pay, the production of goods and services. While the expansion of credit - £1trn in ten years - leverages growth and asset prices, sooner or later, the process reverses with devastating effect. If all debts were to be repaid tomorrow, the consequence would be economic collapse, in the absence of any alternative source of new money.\r\nIt is excess private debt which has simultaneously made banks insolvent and created public deficits. Austerity programmes, however, are ideological rather than being based on any economic logic and will not address either deficits which are a fact of basic macroeconomic accounting or public debt which is unnecessary.\r\nQuestions\r\n• What is the ethical basis for charging interest on a debt which costs nothing to produce, giving a private cartel sole control over a public good?\r\n• Why with the most productive economy in history do we suffer recessions, unemployment, poverty and inequality? \r\n• How would government-issued money work? Would it encourage reckless spending or inflation?\r\nThe talk will be given by Ken MacIntyre, an independent researcher who holds Masters degrees from both Edinburgh and London University.\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": null, "added": "2013-03-12T19:26:40", "slug": "sunday-lecture-money-austerity-and-the-financial-crisis", "speakers": [{"id": 13520, "name": "Ken MacIntyre", "slug": "ken-macintyre"}], "topics": [{"id": 1822, "name": "philosophy", "path": "/academic/religion/religion/philosophy"}, {"id": 2388, "name": "philosophy", "path": "/arts/literature/philosophy/philosophy"}, {"id": 2287, "name": "banks", "path": "/politics/capitalism/banks"}, {"id": 316, "name": "philosophy", "path": "/arts/art/philosophy"}], "supercategory": "academic", "venue": {"id": 1620, "name": "SPES", "slug": "spes", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC1R 4RL"}, "organizer": {"id": 1620, "name": "SPES", "slug": "spes"}, "date": "2013-03-17", "dates": [{"id": 12684, "from_date": "2013-03-17", "to_date": "2013-03-17", "time": "11:00:00", "ticket_cost": "£3", "ticket_info": "Entry on the door", "additional_info": "Free Tea & Coffee will be available.", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 1620, "name": "SPES", "slug": "spes", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC1R 4RL"}, "organizer": {"id": 1620, "name": "SPES", "slug": "spes"}}]}, {"id": 12161, "title": "Elections in Kenya: Is bloodshed inevitable?", "synopsis": "As Kenyans head to the election polls, we will be examining the results and what they mean for the future of the country.", "keywords": "Frontline club, Frontline Club Talk, Kenya, elections, ", "body": "In 2007, Kenya’s disputed presidential election descended into violence in which more than 1,000 people were killed.

Ironically enough, the accession of the island to the EU added a new dimension to its division. According to Protocol 10 on Cyprus of the Act of Accession 2003, the application of the acquis is 'suspended in those areas of the Republic of Cyprus in which the Government of the Republic of Cyprus does not have effective control.' The scope of the talk is twofold: on the one hand it provides for a concise but accurate analytical framework of the derogations to the suspension of the acquis and on the other, it assesses the pragmatic approach that the Union has adopted when dealing with issues arising from the conflict such as the isolation of the Turkish Cypriots, the \"settlers\" etc. The main thesis of the paper is that although the application of the acquis is suspended in northern Cyprus, the territorial character of the suspension has allowed a limited integration of those Areas within the EU. In addition and with regard to a possible future settlement of the Cyprus issue, the paper argues that the Union is 'ready to accommodate the terms of such a settlement in line with the principles on which the EU is founded. \r\n\r\nDr Nikos Skoutaris is a A.N.

This is especially the case for an economy with weak international competitiveness as well as weak institutions and capacity, making it particularly difficult to control inflation. Greece cannot sustain inflation above its euro partners, since its international trade volume is heavily affected by inflation differentials between the country and those partners. This study adds to the relevant literature by attempting to explain inflation dynamics in Greece over the period 1981-2009. It uses three distinct approaches: the inflation persistent hypothesis, the identification of spillover effects among various sectors in the economy through a Vector Autoregressive Model (VAR) and the investigation of the domestic Balassa-Samuelson effect. \r\n\r\nNicholas Apergis is Professor in Economics, Department of Banking and Financial Management, University of Piraeus.   \r\n\r\nDr Vassilis Monastiriotis is a Senior Lecturer in the Political Economy of South Eastern Europe and Acting Director of LSEE-Research on South Eastern Europe. \r\n\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 732, "added": "2012-09-22T12:15:15", "slug": "2c47b903b0fd1fb5", "speakers": [{"id": 12921, "name": "Nicholas  Apergis", "slug": "nicholas-apergis"}, {"id": 12904, "name": "Dr  Vassilis  Monastiriotis ", "slug": "dr-vassilis-monastiriotis"}], "topics": [{"id": 2940, "name": "europe", "path": "/academic/history/european/history/earlymoderneuropeanhistory/eu"}, {"id": 2482, "name": "europe", "path": "/business/economy/growth/welfare/europe"}, {"id": 2947, "name": "economics", "path": "/politics/environment/environment/economics"}], "supercategory": "academic", "venue": {"id": 2758, "name": "COW 1.11,", "slug": "cow-111", "city": "London School of Economics & Political Science", "postcode": "WC2A 2AE"}, "organizer": {"id": 1287, "name": "London School of Economics & Political Science", "slug": "london-school-of-economics-political-science"}, "date": "2012-10-09", "dates": [{"id": 12063, "from_date": "2012-10-09", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "18:00:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": "This event is free and open to all with no ticket required.

We conclude the sale of shares is not as important as the intensity of the regulatory framework and political (not management) maneuvering when it comes to labor unions.

His works challenge the establishment and people’s existing systems, as well as perceptions about their daily lives.

Despite a conventional education at art university in Japan, where he studied painting, Ozawa, from the start of his artistic career, has always resisted creating his work in an isolated environment. He frequently collaborates with other artists, and often draws on audience participation, using his work as a kind of \"art weapon\" for opening dialogue. \r\n\r\nIn this artist talk, Tsuyoshi Ozawa will reveal to the UK audience for the first time the unique artistic path he has walked over the past decades, explaining the creative process behind many of his compelling works. In a discussion to follow, he will be joined by Adrian Favell, Professor of Sociology in Paris and a writer on Japanese contemporary art, to further examine Ozawa’s relation to contemporary Japanese society, his significance in a global context, and issues of \"relational art\" in his work, part of an important trend in contemporary art practice.", "additional_info": null, "duration": 120, "image_id": 1581, "added": "2011-09-16T11:13:36", "slug": "cbf80560e6a3cdd7", "speakers": [{"id": 11492, "name": "Mr Tsuyoshi Ozawa", "slug": "mr-tsuyoshi-ozawa"}, {"id": 11493, "name": "Professor Adrian Favell", "slug": "professor-adrian-favell"}], "topics": [{"id": 1018, "name": "talk", "path": "/arts/education/debate/talk"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 1853, "name": "The Japan Foundation", "slug": "the-japan-foundation", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC1B 5EH"}, "organizer": {"id": 1853, "name": "The Japan Foundation", "slug": "the-japan-foundation"}, "date": "2011-09-20", "dates": [{"id": 10570, "from_date": "2011-09-20", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "18:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Free, booking essential", "ticket_info": "This event is free to attend but booking is essential.

There are 62 indigenous language groups, many of which have multiple dialects.\r\nIn different periods of the development of anthropology in Mexico, there are concepts that endure, change their meaning and coexist with new conceptualisations, such as indio and indígena. The times and places when these definitions are being made are dynamic, they transcend, change route or become out of fashion and forgotten. \r\n\r\nAnthropologists are important in constructing and reproducing stereotypes and present dramatic figures, strongly idealised of the subjects being represented (indígenas) and pretend neutrality. Indio and indígena are unavoidable categories in the analysis of the ethnic and national difficulties in Mexico. Historically, these terms have been stigmatised by referring in a generic way to a group that is presented as homogenous but that emerged from conquest and colonisation and is both culturally and linguistically diverse. \r\n\r\nThe concepts produced by anthropologists that construct images of the indio and of the indígena, paradoxically contribute to the domination of indigenous people while simultaneously serving their struggle against that same domination. \r\n\r\nFrom its origins as a science, anthropology has influenced the ethnic policies of the State and its social institutions. The anthropologist has a social responsibility which is a crucial issue for their academic practice. Furthermore, such responsibility also means critical analysis of anthropological science itself.\r\n\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 120, "image_id": null, "added": "2011-03-19T14:11:28", "slug": "the-indigenous-peoples-in-mexican-anthropology-concepts-and-representations", "speakers": [{"id": 10949, "name": "Professor Castellanos Guerrero", "slug": "professor-castellanos-guerrero"}], "topics": [{"id": 2488, "name": "mexico", "path": "/academic/anthropology/mexico"}], "supercategory": "academic", "venue": {"id": 2443, "name": "The Old Library Building, Third Floor", "slug": "the-old-library-building-third-floor", "city": "Newcastle upon Tyne", "postcode": "NE1 7RU"}, "organizer": {"id": 2441, "name": "Newcastle University School of Geography, Politics & Sociology", "slug": "newcastle-university-school-of-geography-politics-sociology"}, "date": "2011-03-30", "dates": [{"id": 10021, "from_date": "2011-03-30", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "16:00:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": "Please register at http://www.ncl.ac.uk/gps/about/events/item/public-lecture2", "additional_info": null, "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 2443, "name": "The Old Library Building, Third Floor", "slug": "the-old-library-building-third-floor", "city": "Newcastle upon Tyne", "postcode": "NE1 7RU"}, "organizer": {"id": 2441, "name": "Newcastle University School of Geography, Politics & Sociology", "slug": "newcastle-university-school-of-geography-politics-sociology"}}]}, {"id": 9282, "title": "Private Equity Insider: A candid chat with Tony James ", "synopsis": "Department of Finance public lecture", "keywords": "finance, private equity, economics", "body": "Although the private equity industry has existed for more than three decades and has grown to be an important actor in the world economy, it is still an industry surrounded by controversy.

From the national smoking ban in public places, to local authorities designating certain streets and parks booze-free zones, the urge to legislate against ‘wrong personal choices’ has grown ever stronger in recent years. While some saw such Nanny State-ism as peculiar to New Labour, the new coalition has announced that it too will encourage the public ‘to make the right choices about what they eat, drink and do in their leisure time’. Despite the language of right and wrong, we are reassured that this is not moralism. Policy-makers are simply responding to what the latest research shows. But the type of evidence cited, and the conclusions drawn, reflect a broader change in the role of public health. Where once it was about society-wide schemes such as mass vaccinations or sanitation, now its focus is on micro-managing individuals’ lifestyle choices. As primary health care has shifted away from diagnosis and treatment towards managing patients’ behaviour to prevent future illnesses, GPs are often on the front line of delivering endless evidence-based ‘advice’ as to how patients should live.\r\n\r\nCritics object that in this context, medical evidence has become politicised. Indeed, Richard Smith, former editor of the British Medical Journal, and one of the experts responsible for government recommendations on how many ‘units’ of alcohol we should drink, has admitted the figures were ‘plucked out of the air’. When research published in April showed the much-vaunted ‘five a day’ (portions of fruit and vegetables) confers only marginal health benefits, campaigners insisted the advice should be promoted anyway, to drum home a wider message about obesity and junk foods. And while politicians have embraced ‘evidence-based policy’, when government advisor David Nutt went off-message on drugs policy, he was punished for overstepping his jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nHow far can evidence go in deciding what is a ‘right’ or ‘wrong’ choice? The consensus seems to be that healthy means good, regardless of anything else. Healthy, clean-living restraint may appeal to some, but others may feel more sympathy for Clement Freud’s famous quip that in giving up life’s irresponsible pleasures, ‘You don’t actually live longer; it just seems longer’. Do preventative health initiatives risk becoming moralism in disguise, or are they simply a responsible way of stopping people harming themselves?

However, there are many examples of apparent altruism in nature. Meerkats help to raise others' offspring, primates groom one another and share food, and some insects even sacrifice themselves to protect their colony. Humans are among the most cooperative of all species. We willingly help individuals we do not know and are unlikely to ever meet again. Indeed, this tendency may explain our huge ecological success. However, our failure to cooperate is also responsible for several global problems, including climate change, freshwater depletion and overfishing. This meeting aims to elucidate common factors driving cooperation in humans and non-human animals. In doing so we may gain important insights into resolving these and other global cooperation problems.\r\n\r\n_Organised by Nichola Raihani, Institute of Zoology, ZSL._\r\n\r\nThis event in the 'Communicating Science' series will begin at 6.00pm (doors from 5.00pm) and talks are scheduled to finish at 7.30pm; admission is free and open to everyone (no advance booking or registration required).

Well, sort of. Certainly parent power is in vogue in English schools. Education Minister Michael Gove’s big idea is to back the likes of writer and celebrity parent Toby Young in allowing parents to set up their own ‘free’ schools. It is claimed these will be truly local schools, with boards of governors consisting of parents of children at the school. The New Schools Network already has 450 parent groups on its books from across the social spectrum. This suggests substantial dissatisfaction with the state of British education. Who can blame so many parents for reacting against the previous government’s target culture, factory schooling, its devaluation of subject-based academic learning, the micromanagement of everything from homework to school dinners, dumbed-down examinations and watered-down curriculum? Despite the ‘education, education, education’ rhetoric of New Labour, many parents simply don’t trust the state to educate their offspring. While it’s understandable that parents want to ensure their children get the best schooling possible, opponents of the free schools policy, from teachers’ unions to former education ministers, complain it will divert resources from state provision and that only ‘the sharp-elbowed and better off’ will set up free schools. \r\n\r\nLess remarked upon is the possible effect of parent power on teachers’ autonomy. Might pushy parents intervening in the minutiae of school life undermine the authority of teachers? Do mummy and daddy always know best when it comes to judging how children should learn, what should be taught? If parents claim they know what is best educationally for their particular child, where does that leave the ideal of universal access to decent education for all and teachers control in the classroom? Indeed might it foster a climate of mistrust between teachers and parents? Already in state (‘unfree’?) secondary schools from September 2010, parents will have the right to monitor every aspect of their child’s schooling online; every interaction between a pupil and teacher must be recorded and made public. Will such surveillance improve teaching standards or hinder teachers’ freedom in disciplining and teaching the young?\r\n\r\nMore broadly, what will society’s attitude be to those parents who don’t want to be more involved in their child’s education? Might they be stigmatised as indifferent and irresponsible? What will our attitude be to those children whose parents are not interested in becoming self-trained pedagogues or amateur educational bureaucrats? Might their parents be scapegoated for poor educational attainment? Who will govern the parent governors?

Capitalism is cyclical – and increasingly bankrupt. Boom-and-bust is its model. Laying bare the follies of the international financial system, eminent academic David Harvey looks at the nature of capitalism and why it's time to call a halt to its unbridled excesses. \r\n\r\nHe examines the vast flows of money that surge round the world in daily volumes well in excess of the sum of all its economies. He looks at the cycles of boom and bust in the world's housing and stock markets and shows that periodic episodes of meltdown are not only inevitable in the capitalist system but essential to its survival. \r\n\r\nThe essence of capitalism is its amorality and lawlessness and to talk of a regulated, ethical capitalism is to make a fundamental error. The Enigma of Capital considers how crises of the current sort can best be contained within the constraints of capitalism, and makes the case for a social order that would allow us to live within a system that really could be responsible, just, and humane. \r\n\r\nDavid Harvey is Distinguished Professor of Anthropology at the City University of New York Graduate School and former Professor of Geography at Johns Hopkins and Oxford Universities. The author of numerous books, he was awarded the Patron's Medal of the Royal Geographical Society in 1995 and elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2007.

In particular, since many psychic phenomena seem to involve a direct interaction between mind and the physical world, this suggests that any theoretical framework for the subject requires some sort of extension of physics. This talk discusses whether physics, in either its present or some future form, will ever be able to accommodate psi or indeed any other type of mental experience. Although some phenomena which are labelled “psychic” may turn out to be explicable in terms of current physics, Bernard Carr will argue that most are not and that these will require a different physical paradigm from the ones that currently prevail. This is not too implausible since physics regularly undergoes paradigm shifts. The new paradigm must assign a central role to consciousness and there are already indications that this is a fundamental rather than incidental feature of the Universe. He will present his own view as to what form the new paradigm might take. This entails a radical reassessment of the divide between matter and mind, famously introduced by Descartes as a way of delineating the domain of science.\r\n\r\nBernard Carr is Professor of Mathematics and Astronomy at Queen Mary, University of London. His professional area of research is cosmology and includes such topics as the early universe, black holes, dark matter and the anthropic principle. He has recently edited a book entitled Universe or Multiverse? His other academic interest is psychical research and he has been a member of the Society for Psychical Research for some 30 years, serving as its President in the period 2000-2004. His approach to the subject is mainly theoretical but he emphasizes its experiential as well as experimental aspects.

Birds have been particularly well studied and we can benefit from the wealth of previous studies and analyses of existing long-term datasets to help understand the implications of climate change on wildlife.  Dr Humphrey Crick will review studies of changes in phenology, breeding performance, population size, distributions and migratory behaviour on birds.  The weakest form of evidence is in the form of anecdote (i.e. observations of distributional change without statistical correlations to climate change).  Next there are studies of relationships between an aspect of biology and weather, with the inference that future changes in climate will cause long-term changes in the performance of an organism.  Then there are observations of long-term changes that can be related to long-term changes in climate.  The ideal, where we know the short-term mechanisms underlying observed long-term changes, is extremely rare, as are confident predictions of the consequences of long-term changes for aspects such as life-time reproductive success, fitness, population trajectories and distributional change.  Birds, through flight, should be rather immune to the impacts of climate change because theoretically they should be able to fly from their current habitat to occupy new ones as conditions change.  However, there is evidence building that not all birds may be able to fly from the impacts of climate change. \r\n\r\nDr Humphrey Crick is a Senior Ecologist at the British Trust for Ornithology who has studied the impacts of climate change on birds over the past 10 years.  He has promoted the use of the extensive, nation-wide datasets held by the BTO which, by the long-term nature, provide fascinating insights into current changes in the light of past events.  He was invited to help review the 3rd and 4th reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and has helped brief incoming Government Ministers on the effects of climate change on biodiversity.\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 120, "image_id": null, "added": "2007-08-23T21:31:05", "slug": "british-wildlife-and-climate-change-can-birds-fly-from-climate-change", "speakers": [{"id": 5803, "name": "Dr Humphrey Crick", "slug": "dr-humphrey-crick"}], "topics": [{"id": 1105, "name": "ecology", "path": "/science/ecology"}, {"id": 225, "name": "environment", "path": "/science/environment"}, {"id": 70, "name": "biology", "path": "/science/biology"}, {"id": 868, "name": "climate", "path": "/science/climatechange/climate"}, {"id": 468, "name": "naturalhistory", "path": "/science/naturalhistory"}, {"id": 467, "name": "zoology", "path": "/science/zoology"}], "supercategory": "science", "venue": {"id": 1433, "name": "at a Birkbeck lecture theatre/University of London", "slug": "at-a-birkbeck-lecture-theatreuniversity-of-london", "city": "London", "postcode": "W C1E"}, "organizer": {"id": 1069, "name": "Ecology and Conservation Studies Society", "slug": "ecology-and-conservation-studies-society"}, "date": "2007-11-02", "dates": [{"id": 4786, "from_date": "2007-11-02", "to_date": "2007-11-02", "time": "18:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": "For free tickets and venue details, contact tel:  020 7679 1069, or e-mail:   environment@fce.bbk.ac.uk", "additional_info": "For queries on lecture content, contact tel:  020 7485 7903, or e-mail:   jeremy.wright@walkern.org.uk", "members_only": "No", "members_info": "Details of the Society and application forms will be available at the door, and are on our website http://www.bbk.ac.uk/ce/environment/ecssociety/index.shtml", "venue": {"id": 1433, "name": "at a Birkbeck lecture theatre/University of London", "slug": "at-a-birkbeck-lecture-theatreuniversity-of-london", "city": "London", "postcode": "W C1E"}, "organizer": {"id": 1069, "name": "Ecology and Conservation Studies Society", "slug": "ecology-and-conservation-studies-society"}}]}, {"id": 4504, "title": "Art and Immaterial Labour", "synopsis": "Conference organised by the Centre for Research in Modern Philosophy.

He is responsible for the greatest change in the recorded history of Europe so far: the adoption and patronage by the Roman establishment of the Christian religion. He was acclaimed emperor by his troops in York on the death of his father in 306. His father's main residence had been at Trier and Constantine must have spent much time there both during and after his father's life, before he crossed the Alps with an army in 312 eventually to defeat his western rival outside Rome at the \"Battle of the Milvian Bridge\". It was in 313 that he met with his ally in the East, Licinius, in Milan. Constantinople was founded in 324 and dedicated in 330. The first ecumenical council was held at Nicaea (Iznik as now) in 325. Constantine's mother, Helena, visited the Holy Land in 326/7. Constantine finally died in 337, but then there come the Successors to Constantine!\r\n\r\nThe series of talks makes no claims to be comprehensive, but is intended to stimulate interest and provide information on this period of fundamental importance. \r\n\r\nLocation: the Holst Room.

Gallery visits will use the great collections of the Museum to look at developments in sculpture, metalwork, textiles, furniture and ceramics. The course will concentrate on those areas of Europe where innovation occurred, mainly Italy, France, Germany, the Netherlands and England. Patronage, both courtly and civic, will be examined. The increasing prosperity of the middle classes, especially in England and the Netherlands, made consumer goods widely available, and we will look at the ways in which people could acquire them. The effects of war, revolution and economic policies will be related to the production of art and artefacts; and the trading voyages of the Dutch, Portuguese and English, resulting in imports of oriental goods, will be examined.\r\n\r\nThe Renaissance of fifteenth century Italy filtered gradually through other parts of Europe, profoundly affecting all the arts. The invention of printing in the 1450&#8217;s meant that the printed word and the illustrated book could reach a new audience; we will examine the role of books and prints in the promotion of new styles in the sixteenth century. At the same time the Reformation wrought havoc with the established order, and a century of war and revolution followed throughout Europe. In England, parts of Germany and the Netherlands, waves of iconoclasm meant the destruction of much religious art and led to a new and more austere Protestant church. By the mid-seventeenth century Europe was divided into Catholic and Protestant states.  This was followed by a new spirit of enquiry, and the arts and sciences flourished. \r\n\r\nTickets: \r\nFull course: £1525, Concessionary rate(V&A members and patrons): £1375\r\n\r\nPer Term: full rate: £525, senior citizens, V&A members and Patrons: £475, Students, disabled and ES40 holders £132.\r\n\r\nCertificate Option: £350 (in addition to full course fees and payable in full before commencing the course, no concessions).\r\n\r\nDay Rate: Full rate:£45, senior citizens, V&A members and Patrons: £41, students, disabled and ES-40 holders £11.\r\n\r\nMorning coffee/tea is included.

Join an artist, scientist and historical curator for a tour of thought-provoking medical objects from the past, present and future.\r\n\r\nCan you tell who you are from looking in the mirror? What if your face were to be rearranged in some way? Artist Paddy Hartley has created unique face corsets that alter the shape of the wearer's face and will be demonstrating these on the audience. Through the corsets, Hartley examines perceptions of beauty and alternative means of achieving the wearer's ideals of perfection.\r\n\r\nThe corsets have been developed with Ian Thompson from the tissue-engineering group at Imperial College London, who uses cutting-edge material implants to repair facial injuries. Ian's research involves making and refining bioactive glass implants to reconstruct faces badly damaged by accidents or surgery. Bioactive glass has a very similar composition to bone, which encourages surrounding bone to grow around it. Ian will talk about these implants and how, through his collaboration with Paddy, science and art have converged to develop pioneering techniques.\r\n\r\nAndrew Bamji, an expert on the historical origins of facial reconstruction and historical curator of the Gillies Archive, Queen Mary's Hospital, will look at the history of facial surgery. Queen Mary's was one of the pioneering hospitals performing plastic surgery of the face between 1917 and 1925. The Gillies Archive documents the pioneering facial reconstruction work of Dr Gillies during the First World War. It holds many facial plaster casts of the treated serviceman and illustrations and photographs documenting facial injury during the war. Andrew will show some of these artefacts and talk about his collaboration with Paddy and Ian.\r\n\r\nJoin Paddy, Ian and Andrew at this object handling and discussion evening. You'll be able to try on the face corsets, handle the bio-implants, watch footage of them in the making and find out more about the inspiration behind them.

Why do some people enjoy dance and not others?  What does creativity mean? Poetry, sculpture, painting, music and dance will be presented and analysed by a team of leading neuroscientists, offering audiences a rare opportunity to look into the minds of artists, performers and musicians.\r\n\r\nMidsummer Celebration: Arts & the Mind includes a live contemporary dance which will be broken down to reveal how movement stimulates the brain; the story of a former builder who since suffering a stroke has become a prolific artist, and an exploration into how the brain processes music through the interpretation of a jazz and classical recital.  Finally, visitors will be able to express their own opinions and queries in a debate on creativity with a panel of artists, musicians and scientists.\r\n\r\nSpeakers include Professor Margaret Boden, University of Sussex, Dr Mark Lythgoe, Institute of Child Health and Tony Gilland from the Institute of Ideas.

But how does dance stir our emotions and senses?   How does the brain interpret the 'vocabulary' of dance?  Why do some people get pleasure from watching dance and not others? Neuroscientist Dr Sarah-Jayne Blakemore analyses the performance of dancers - choreographed by Laban dance specialists, Henrietta Bannerman and Susan Sentler - to investigate how unpredictable movement stimulates the brain's activities.\r\n\r\nART & THE ALTERED MIND \r\nd.study: 19.45 – 20.15\r\nSince suffering a stoke in 2001 former builder Tommy McHugh has felt an insatiable need to create, from painting and drawing to writing and sculpting.   The dramatic change to McHugh’s character and his newfound creativity is investigated by leading neurophysiologist Dr Mark Lythgoe, who will be using a series of interactive experiments to explore the mind of Tommy.  \r\n\r\nWHAT IS CREATIVITY? \r\n(d.studio: 19.45 - 20.15 )\r\nRenowned author of The Creative Mind and Research Professor of Cognitive Science at the University of Sussex, Margaret Boden, uses the humanities, science and technology to explain the enigma of creativity, how science and arts are different and how we come up with creative ideas.\r\n\r\nWHAT DRIVES ARTISTIC CREATIVITY\r\n(Panel Discussion d.studio: 20.30 – 21.30)\r\nCan scientific monitoring of brain activity really illuminate our understanding of artistic processes? Does genius reside in the brain or is it a more complex social phenomenon? Is there a danger of biological based explanations of creativity squeezing out an appreciation of social factors, schooling and raw talent?
