What reliance can we put upon our perceptions?\r\n\r\nIn Plato's Republic these questions are directly addressed by a passage which is commonly called \"the divided line\": it presents an image of a line with four sections, each corresponding to a level of reality with its appropriate human faculty of perception.  Plato takes us through an ascent from the most ephemeral and temporal of perceptions to the most fundamental and stable of insights – but are our experiences as he describes them? And why should he make such distinctions?\r\n\r\nThe Republic is a dialogue concerned with the choices of life – our attempts to live well, to act justly, to play our part in the whole – and for Plato wise choices are impossible without understanding.

These evenings will be run at Cecil Sharp House, just off Regents Park, on a fortnightly basis.  The emphasis will be on audience participation and any lectures will be relatively short, and have plenty of time set aside for collective exploration of emerging themes and ideas.\r\n\r\nAs this is the Prometheus Trust's first regular meeting in London we thought we might begin with an attempt at a broad brushstroke lecture on philosophy and the Platonic tradition.  We'll look at some fundamental questions – What is philosophy?  What is the wisdom which it cultivates?  What part does it play in human life?  How do we go about finding a stable foundation for philosophical enquiry?  What powers does a human being need to exercise in the philosophical exploration of truth?\r\n  \r\nAfter what will necessarily be a brief look at such questions, we'll go on to look at the Platonic tradition as the great tap-root of Western culture: what did Plato, his predecessors and his successors think they were doing as they philosophized?  How did they address the differing levels of human experience?  In what way did their approach to philosophy differ from what is now considered to be \"doing philosophy\"? What (self-imposed) demands were placed upon a would-be philosopher? \r\n \r\nFinally, and perhaps most importantly, we will attempt to look at the Platonic tradition not as a historical artefact, but as a living, breathing, growing tradition – one which, should any individual so choose, can be entered and which both gives and receives insights to and from today's men and women.\r\n\r\nWe will aim to keep the formal lecture to no more than 45 minutes so that we have a least an hour for an open forum discussion of these ideas.  Although we hope to offer some firm foundations for future meetings, the evening will be very much a starting point and one which will raise far more questions than it answers.\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 2119, "added": "2014-10-22T10:39:20", "slug": "51fd57c8c8fecca2", "speakers": [{"id": 3573, "name": "  Tim Addey", "slug": "tim-addey"}, {"id": 10620, "name": "Mr Guy Wyndham-Jones", "slug": "mr-guy-wyndham-jones"}], "topics": [{"id": 1822, "name": "philosophy", "path": "/academic/religion/religion/philosophy"}, {"id": 2388, "name": "philosophy", "path": "/arts/literature/philosophy/philosophy"}, {"id": 365, "name": "platonism", "path": "/arts/philosophy/platonism"}, {"id": 2080, "name": "spiritual", "path": "/academic/philosophy/spiritual"}], "supercategory": "academic", "venue": {"id": 3106, "name": "Cecil Sharp House", "slug": "cecil-sharp-house", "city": "London", "postcode": "NW1 7AY"}, "organizer": {"id": 2041, "name": "The Prometheus Trust", "slug": "the-prometheus-trust"}, "date": "2014-11-03", "dates": [{"id": 14692, "from_date": "2014-11-03", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "19:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Donations between £3-5 encouraged", "ticket_info": "At the door.", "additional_info": null, "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 3106, "name": "Cecil Sharp House", "slug": "cecil-sharp-house", "city": "London", "postcode": "NW1 7AY"}, "organizer": {"id": 2041, "name": "The Prometheus Trust", "slug": "the-prometheus-trust"}}]}, {"id": 14132, "title": "Horseshoes & Nails, Sharp & Blunt Knives - High Court Ceremonial", "synopsis": "Lecture by The Revd David Chesters OBE", "keywords": "Law, Ceremony", "body": "Learn more about High Court Ceremonial", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": null, "added": "2014-10-05T17:44:42", "slug": "37d82283b0d271f7", "speakers": [{"id": 14458, "name": "Revd David Chesters", "slug": "revd-david-chesters"}], "topics": [{"id": 3733, "name": "ceremony", "path": "/academic/law/ceremony"}], "supercategory": "academic", "venue": {"id": 331, "name": "Grosvenor Museum", "slug": "grosvenor-museum", "city": "Chester", "postcode": "CH1 2DD"}, "organizer": {"id": 331, "name": "Grosvenor Museum", "slug": "grosvenor-museum"}, "date": "2015-05-19", "dates": [{"id": 14645, "from_date": "2015-05-19", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "19:30:00", "ticket_cost": "£4 or £2", "ticket_info": "pay on door", "additional_info": "Grosvenor Museum Lecture Theatre", "members_only": "No", "members_info": "Grosvenor Museum Society members free, Non members £4, students with valid card £2", "venue": {"id": 331, "name": "Grosvenor Museum", "slug": "grosvenor-museum", "city": "Chester", "postcode": "CH1 2DD"}, "organizer": {"id": 331, "name": "Grosvenor Museum", "slug": "grosvenor-museum"}}]}, {"id": 13905, "title": " CFI UK Conference: Vampires, Werewolves and Witches", "synopsis": "Deborah Hyde, Jessica Monteith, and Owen Davies introduce us to the myth and the reality regarding some of the most horrific creatures imaginable.

Such stereotypes still persist even today.\r\n\r\nIn her book 'Not Just Beer and Bingo! The Social History of Working Men’s Clubs’, Dr. Ruth Cherrington seeks to go beyond these, offering instead the first, comprehensive account of clubs from their mid-19th century origins to their current state of decline.  In this talk, she will provide a brief introduction to her book, outlining the main historical trends across 150 years of club life. The sweep of her work goes across right across the country but there will be focus on London clubs, which played a huge part in the club movement. Many early clubs were set up in London and the Home Counties, and some of them remain open to this day- such as Walthamstow WMC (established 1860) and the Mildmay Radical which dates back to the 1880s.  \r\n\r\nShe will outline the key areas of club life, which go beyond the beer and bingo of popular imagination. The early establishment of Club and Institute convalescent homes, for example, will be mentioned alongside the importance of charitable work that clubs have always been involved in.  The links to the rise of the entertainment industry and the continued importance of clubs as a training ground for talent will also feature. So many of our most popular entertainers began their careers in clubs- from Dame Vera Lynn, to Tom Jones and many more contemporary performers.  Women were excluded from some clubs it is true – but not from all and Ruth will outline how women found a place for pleasure within the traditional patriarchal arrangements of clubs.\r\n\r\nThis will include aspects of women as members as well as entertainers.  Children and older people were also traditionally catered for and activities for them will be briefly outlined such as the Christmas parties and trips to the seaside.  And what of education and politics which were central in many early clubs? Their importance will be outlined but also how these did diminish.  Finally, the decline of clubs will be outlined with the main reasons for this cited along with their prospects for the future. \r\n\r\nA central theme running through the talk will be how clubs were a key part not only of working class leisure time but also of working class communities. Yet their contributions have barely been acknowledged by those outside the club movement.", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": null, "added": "2013-06-22T14:32:06", "slug": "20b8a3f7d6d95092", "speakers": [{"id": 13858, "name": "Ruth Cherrington", "slug": "ruth-cherrington"}], "topics": [{"id": 3439, "name": "clubs", "path": "/society/communities/clubs"}, {"id": 3438, "name": "men", "path": "/society/communities/men"}, {"id": 3437, "name": "workingclass", "path": "/society/communities/workingclass"}], "supercategory": "society", "venue": {"id": 2783, "name": "Housmans Bookshop", "slug": "housmans-bookshop", "city": "London", "postcode": "N1 9DX"}, "organizer": {"id": 2783, "name": "Housmans Bookshop", "slug": "housmans-bookshop"}, "date": "2013-07-10", "dates": [{"id": 13168, "from_date": "2013-07-10", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "19:00:00", "ticket_cost": "Entry £3, redeemable against any purchase", "ticket_info": "At the door on the night", "additional_info": "HOW TO FIND US:\r\nWe're very easy to find - just a two minute walk from King's Cross/St.Pancras terminals.

After learning all he could from imported prints and books he resolved to cross the Alps to study Italian art at first hand. Rather than travelling to Florence or Rome, Dürer stopped and stayed in Venice. On his arrival, Venetian artists received him with great honour but with some jealousy. The technical brilliance of his graphic work had made a big impact in Italy, yet his paintings were said to lack such qualities as the deep, rich colour for which Venetian art was renowned. Dürer was determined to ‘stop the mouths’ of his critics before returning to effect a revolution, a ‘renaissance’ in the arts in Germany. Close links between Venice and Germany had been long established and this course will examine this direct cultural cross-fertilisation, focusing on works Dürer produced in Italy under the inspiration of Giovanni Bellini, Giorgione and others, together with the influence Dürer’s work had upon them.

", "keywords": "Drama, Debate, Play", "body": "Carl Djerassi’s new play Insufficiency is concerned with contentious topics among scientists, including suspicion of commercial-research funding and the dangers of conservative and conformist thinking amongst academics. Yet attempts to dramatise important scientific debates are themselves notoriously difficult and controversial. While there are undoubted successes, such as Brecht’s Life of Galileo and Michael Frayn’s Copenhagen, universal acclaim across the science and arts world is rare. John Adams’ Doctor Atomic may have offered an operatic vision of Robert Oppenheimer, for example, but offered little of historical or scientific value. Alternatively, it can be difficult to know in Inherit The Wind whether the audience is cheering on a thrilling depiction of the Scopes Monkey Trial, or applauding themselves for being on the ‘right’ side of the argument over teaching evolution.\r\n\r\nIt is a question which becomes even more vexed in an age where leading scientists such as Sir Paul Nurse express concerns over the ‘scientific illiteracy’ of the public and detect an increasingly confused and occasionally hostile attitude towards science in political life. Leading science commentators have declared it is time to ‘mobilise the geeks’ and there is a thriving community of celebrity scientists and science communicators dedicated to challenging ‘bad science’ and better educate society on increasingly complex scientific issues. The question of artistic licence becomes ever-more fraught with considerations in this climate. Playwright Richard Bean may have thrilled Royal Court audiences with his dark comedy on climate change scepticism, but some questioned whether it merely played upon the prejudices of a non-scientific audience. At the same time, Stephen Emmott’s Ten Billion may have been an innovative attempt to ‘perform’ a lecture as a piece of art but, in choosing to present one side of the debate on overpopulation as ‘The Science’, it could be accused of misrepresentation.\r\n\r\nGood drama can thrive even if the audience does not subscribe to its politics, but what about scientific inaccuracy? Is it true that there are few good plays about scientists, and even fewer about science itself? Does drama have a duty to educate and inform as well as entertain or engage? Can it successfully offer a bridge between the two cultures, or does it invariably drive them further apart?\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 240, "image_id": 1747, "added": "2012-09-13T11:56:27", "slug": "91f6ab6743b7dde6", "speakers": [{"id": 1030, "name": "Professor Carl Djerassi", "slug": "professor-carl-djerassi"}, {"id": 751, "name": "Timandra Harkness", "slug": "timandra-harkness"}, {"id": 1198, "name": "Dr Ruth Padel", "slug": "dr-ruth-padel"}, {"id": 7070, "name": "Dr  Jennifer Rohn", "slug": "dr-jennifer-rohn"}, {"id": 7443, "name": "David Bowden", "slug": "david-bowden"}], "topics": [{"id": 942, "name": "debate", "path": "/arts/books/poetry/debate"}, {"id": 1779, "name": "debate", "path": "/arts/books/nonfiction/debate"}, {"id": 552, "name": "play", "path": "/children/learning/play"}, {"id": 1842, "name": "play", "path": "/arts/philosophy/play"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 2743, "name": "Riverside Studios", "slug": "riverside-studios", "city": "London", "postcode": "W6 9RL"}, "organizer": {"id": 45, "name": "Institute of Ideas", "slug": "institute-of-ideas"}, "date": "2012-10-06", "dates": [{"id": 11878, "from_date": "2012-10-06", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "14:30:00", "ticket_cost": "£20", "ticket_info": "Call 020 8237 1111 or visit http://www.riversidestudios.co.uk/", "additional_info": "Visit www.battleofideas.org.uk for more information.", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 2743, "name": "Riverside Studios", "slug": "riverside-studios", "city": "London", "postcode": "W6 9RL"}, "organizer": {"id": 45, "name": "Institute of Ideas", "slug": "institute-of-ideas"}}]}, {"id": 11419, "title": "What does the Marikana massacre mean for South Africa?", "synopsis": "We will be joined by a panel of experts to discuss the root causes in society and politics in South Africa that lead to the Marikana massacre.", "keywords": "Frontline club, Frontline Club Talk, South Africa, Marikana, Marikana Massacre, Marikana miners, ANC, Dr Sue Onslow", "body": "The Marikana miners' strike in South Africa which resulted in the shooting dead of 34 workers by police is becoming a pivotal moment in South Africa's post-apartheid history.

Or is there more to say about the positive effect of examinations and external assessments on learning? \r\n\r\nThis seminar is part of the Assessment Principles series of seminars presented by Andrew Watts, a Principal Consultant for the Cambridge Assessment Network Division. The series focuses on five key topics in assessment: the purposes of assessment; the relationship between assessment and learning; the development of assessments; the validity and the reliability of assessments. Each session addresses one of these topics. Though the topics are the same each year, up-to-date issues are discussed which focus on recent news stories or which represent the latest thinking in that area.

'Our chief jester' was, as Winston Churchill said, 'a very dangerous man to his friends', with a darker and more political side. He was a complex figure, in whom many of the conflicts and contradictions of his times mingled. \r\n\r\nThe Dreadnought hoax in 1910 scandalised the Edwardian establishment and provided the tabloid newspapers with a story that would run and run. The man behind it has lived in the popular imagination ever since as the world's greatest practical joker. But he was much more than that. He was a socialist whose hoaxes were intended as skewers to pomposity; a socialite who moved as easily through Soho and Whitechapel as Belgravia; an Anglo-Irish eccentric in whose character violence mingled with dreamy romanticism and high-minded poetic idealism. Once the toast of society and the popular press, he lost his fortune and died alone in poverty. For his most famous hoax, Cole and a group of friends (including the youthful Virginia Woolf) impersonated a delegation of Abyssinian princes and talked their way into an inspection of the Royal Navy's flagship, HMS Dreadnought. Showing a distinctly modern flair for media manipulation, Cole fed the press the story, making him an overnight celebrity and the Navy a laughing stock. With unique access to Cole's papers and letters, Martyn Downer has written the first biography of this fascinating, quixotic and complex man. Now that a century has passed since Cole's audacious stunt, it is surely time for his story to be told. In The Sultan of Zanzibar, Downer conjures up a vanished pre-war world of seedy nightclubs, artistic battles and doomed love affairs with, at its heart-roaring, blustering and raging - its chief jester Horace de Vere Cole. \r\n\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 60, "image_id": null, "added": "2011-02-23T08:10:14", "slug": "sultan-of-zanzibar", "speakers": [{"id": 10844, "name": "Martyn Downer", "slug": "martyn-downer"}], "topics": [], "supercategory": "academic", "venue": {"id": 2153, "name": "The Wheatsheaf", "slug": "the-wheatsheaf", "city": "London ", "postcode": "W1T 1DG"}, "organizer": {"id": 2149, "name": "Sohemian Society", "slug": "sohemian-society"}, "date": "2011-03-28", "dates": [{"id": 9855, "from_date": "2011-03-28", "to_date": "2011-03-28", "time": "19:30:00", "ticket_cost": "£3", "ticket_info": "From door on evening.", "additional_info": "Website:www.sohemians.com", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 2153, "name": "The Wheatsheaf", "slug": "the-wheatsheaf", "city": "London ", "postcode": "W1T 1DG"}, "organizer": {"id": 2149, "name": "Sohemian Society", "slug": "sohemian-society"}}]}, {"id": 9188, "title": "Rethinking Capitalism: emotions as commodities", "synopsis": "Department of Media and Communications public lecture \r\n", "keywords": "capitalism, consumption, production, sociology", "body": "Capitalism has long been seen as promoting a cold rationality, reducing close relationships to self-preoccupation.

One is how achieving greater equality within the rich countries may contribute to tackling the inequalities between rich and poor countries. Another is a discussion of both the compatibility and relative merits of greater equality and economic growth as sources of improvements in the quality of life among rich countries. There is a page discussing how greater equality may contribute to policies designed to tackle global warming, and lastly, a page (The Remedies) pointing out that there are many different ways of increasing equality in our societies.\r\n\r\nThe data we use comes from the most respected international sources including The World Bank, World Health Organisation, United Nations, UNICEF, and US Census Bureau.

He is the author of Liberalism and the Limits of Justice, Democracy's Discontent: America in Search of a Public Philosophy, Public Philosophy: Essays on Morality in Politics, and The Case against Perfection: Ethics in the Age of Genetic Engineering. His undergraduate course, \"Justice,\" has enrolled over 14,000 students. A recipient of the Harvard-Radcliffe Phi Beta Kappa Teaching Prize, Sandel was named a Harvard College Professor in 1999, and in 2008 was recognized by the American Political Science Association for a career of excellence in teaching. He has been a visiting professor at the Sorbonne (Paris), and delivered the BBC Reith Lectures earlier this year. \r\n\r\nFrom 2002 to 2005, Sandel served on the President's Council on Bioethics. Sandel is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the Council on Foreign Relations. A more unusual claim to fame is that Professor Sandel is believed to be the inspiration for the nuclear power magnate Montgomery Burns in The Simpsons cartoon. The series' creator Matt Groening and his writers included a host of references to Harvard in the television series. As a joke, Professor Sandel, famed for his Justice course, was turned into the cartoon's least just character.

All cakes would be lemon. We’d have to have secret stashes of vegetables. And what would happen to Belgium? The frightening possibilities could have come to pass more easily than most of us realise, since chocolate depends on such complicated science that it’s a wonder we were ever able to make it. After last year’s successful ‘Chocology’ event, we’re revisiting the topic for another journey through the remarkable science of chocolate. We’ll investigate chocolate’s history, how it’s made, some of its possible health benefits and more. Where does chocolate get its melt-in-the-mouth sensation? Does it deserve its reputation as an antidepressant and aphrodisiac? Any idea what chocolate has in common with ketchup? Stephen Beckett will answer all of these questions, and you may even be asked to take part in one of his delicious demonstrations! As a special treat, Sara Jayne Stanes from the Academy of Chocolate will lead our audience in a fabulous tasting with Amedei chocolate. This event will be chaired by another chocolate insider, Ri Council member Bob Eagle. His 30-year career in the food industry was mainly spent working with chocolate. \r\n\r\nDr Stephen Beckett holds degrees from Durham University and the University of York.
