In the Republic, Plato has Socrates argue that natural talents are distributed alike among both genders and that women should be educated, trained and employed in the same fields and disciplines as men – in music, gymnastics and war, as well as in philosophy. \r\nWe will explore the importance and roles of women philosophers connected with the Platonic tradition, focusing on Axiothea and Lastheneia, female students in Plato’s Academy, Plutarch’s wife Timoxena and his colleague Clea (who was also a priestess), Gemina the Elder and Younger and Amphiclea, female philosophers who were members of Plotinus’ philosophical school, Porphyry’s wife Marcella, Sosipatra, one of the successors of Iamblichus’ philosophical school, and the famous Alexandrian philosopher, Hypatia.

Taylor for a discussion on politics and life in Britain and the impact of austerity.\r\n\r\nBritain’s welfare state, one of the greatest achievements of our post-war reconstruction, was regarded as the cornerstone of modern society. Today, that cornerstone is wilfully being dismantled by a succession of governments, with horrifying consequences. The establishment paints pictures of so-called ‘benefit scroungers’; the disabled, the sickly and the old.\r\n\r\nIn Cut Out: Living Without Welfare (Left Book Blub/Pluto Press), Jeremy Seabrook speaks to people whose support from the state – for whatever reason – is now being withdrawn, rendering their lives unsustainable. In turns disturbing, eye-opening, and ultimately humanistic, these accounts reveal the reality behind the headlines, and the true nature of British politics today.\r\n\r\nJ.D. Taylor, on the other hand, cycled all round Britain, interviewing and staying with strangers from all walks of life. Without a map and travelling with the most basic of gear, the journey revels in serendipity and schadenfreude.\r\n\r\nTaylor’s book, Island Story (Repeater), weaves histories, experiences and ideas to tell another kind of story: one of rebellion and retail parks, migration and inertia, pessimism and disappearing ways of life, and a fiery, unrealised desire for collective belonging and power.\r\n\r\nReviews for Island Story\r\n\r\n“In the spirit of Cobbett this is a beautifully written account of a journey around contemporary Britain which is both political and poetic - a rare combination.” -Anna Minton, author of Ground Control \r\n\r\n“If you want to know what Starkey, Fox, Bryson and Paxman miss, because they travel different roads, this book is for you.” - Danny Dorling\r\n\r\nReview for Jeremy Seabrook\r\n\r\n“For half a century, in one delicately textured study after another, Seabrook has established himself as perhaps Britain’s finest anatomist of class, deindustrialisation, migration and the spiritual consequences of neoliberalism.” - Sukhdev Sandhu, The Guardian\r\n \r\nAbout the Authors\r\n\r\nJeremy Seabrook is a journalist and writer who has written for the New Statesman, Guardian, Time, and Independent.

Yet in the space of a few short years, major and radical challenges developed that would set South Africa on a new path. \r\n\r\nThis lively and original book tells the story of a generation of activists who embraced new forms of opposition politics that would have profound consequences. In the process it rescues the early 1970s from previous neglect and shows just how crucial these years were in the struggle to transform society. It explores the influence of Black Consciousness, the new trade unionism, radicalisation of students on both black and white campuses, the Durban strikes, and Soweto 1976, and concludes that these developments were largely the result of home-grown initiatives, with little influence exercised by the banned and exiled movements for national liberation.\r\n\r\n “Fascinating and important insight into the emergence of a brave young radicalism of the early 1970s embracing white campuses, black consciousness and trade unionism, which raised questions and challenges not only for the apartheid-capitalist nexus but also for the mainstream liberation movement.  Looking back, there is much need for honest reflection and the author does us a service with his well-worked research and writing. It leaves one with tantalising thoughts as to whether the incipient democratic left challenges from civil society and trade union circles in South Africa today might fundamentally change our political landscape.” - Ronnie Kasrils, chief of intelligence for Umkhonto we Sizwe and government minister from 1994 to 2008\r\n\r\nGlenn Moss was a student leader at Wits University in the 1970s.

Despite this, women workers have made major strides since the Ford machinists’ strike led to the Equal Pay Act 1970, as dramatised in the recent film Made in Dagenham. While there are still chauvinists in the high-powered world of business who think women are best suited for administrative roles – if not the kitchen sink - in truth women no longer suffer the gross discrimination they once did. Most workplaces are desperate to recruit more women to senior positions, and even some feminists acknowledge it is women themselves who sometimes choose less demanding careers in order to take responsibility for their children, inevitably earning less money and prestige.\r\n\r\nThe very idea of equality in the workplace is no longer just about this one issue. The 238-page Equality Act 2010 is intended to protect workers against discrimination not only on the grounds of sex, but also race, age, disability, gender reassignment, religion or belief and sexual orientation. Moreover, the act goes beyond prohibiting direct discrimination: employers will also be responsible for ‘perceived discrimination’ and ‘third-party harassment’. As one HR website explains: ‘If a heterosexual is perceived to be gay, lesbian or bisexual – perhaps because of mannerisms or rumours – and becomes the butt of banter’, or ‘if an employee is subjected to joking about their partner’s disability or a friend’s sexual orientation’, they have grounds for complaint. Should we welcome this as an extension of women’s struggle for equal treatment, or has the historic fight for equal rights at work now been reduced to policing one another’s comments and attitudes, and running off to the boss if colleagues indulge in un-PC banter?\r\n\r\nDo the much quoted statistics on women failing to reach the top of the ladder really merit a fight for equality, or does a narrow focus on the top corporate jobs miss the point that different people make different choices? Should we, at the very least, focus more on practical obstacles like the lack of child-care options, rather than conjuring up misogynist employers and blaming supposedly sexist attitudes? Do we need to examine workplace issues through the historical prism of gender and oppression at all? Indeed, is equality something we should be worried about at the moment? In the middle of a recession, with public sector cuts and new redundancies announced daily, is arguing for workplace equality a non-starter? Or will women have a fight on their hands to ensure job cuts don’t undo the progress made over the past few decades?

She is best known for her collaborations wth First Nations peoples of western Canada, and has published extensively on wild foods and nutrition, materials, and many other topics. This is a rare opportunity to hear her speak at a European venue.\r\n\r\nTalk summary: Indigenous peoples of northwestern North America are identified by anthropologists mainly as fishers and hunters. Yet, their traditional food systems include many, diverse plant species, as well as some marine algae, lichens and fungi. Plant foods include roots and other underground parts, green leaves and stems, many fruits, inner bark of trees, and a range of beverage teas. These foods collectively provide essential nutrients and have been part of a healthy Indigenous diet over thousands of years. The knowledge required to use these nutritional resources effectively and sustainably is part of an overall system of knowledge that incorporates ecological understanding, taxonomic, and biogeographical expertise, specialized practices of harvesting, processing, and maintaining resource populations, and belief systems that guide their use and management. Women have been the holders and practitioners of much of this plant-based knowledge.\r\n\r\nIn recent years, for a variety of reasons, many of these important Indigenous foods have been declining in use, a dietary trend known as the \u001cnutrition transition,\u001d that is occurring with local and Indigenous Peoples' food systems worldwide. People who once gathered and prepared healthy local food are turning towards more processed and marketed foods many of which are high in unhealthy fats and refined carbohydrates. The result is increased risk of diabetes and heart disease and other health problems. Today, Indigenous communities are using a range of strategies to maintain and strengthen their use of their original foods, and have found partners in universities, NGOs, and government agencies to support this endeavor.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, I will describe some of the diverse Indigenous \u001cwild\u001d foods of the Cascadia Region, including Angiosperms, Gymnosperms, and some Algae, Lichens and Fungi, and discuss the ways in which Indigenous Peoples have maintained and enhanced these resources, what has happened to these food species, and how they are now being reclaimed and re-incorporated into Indigenous Peoples' foodways.\r\n\r\nAdmission is free but must be prebooked using:\r\nhttp://www.eventbee.com/view/nancyturner/event?eventid=62117", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 461, "added": "2009-09-04T04:04:13", "slug": "9134e76e1de44e34", "speakers": [{"id": 8662, "name": "Prof Nancy Turner", "slug": "prof-nancy-turner"}], "topics": [{"id": 142, "name": "books", "path": "/leisure/food/home/cooking/books"}, {"id": 217, "name": "botany", "path": "/science/biology/botany"}, {"id": 939, "name": "plants", "path": "/leisure/gardening/plants"}, {"id": 1655, "name": "ethnobotany", "path": "/academic/anthropology/ethnobotany"}, {"id": 1837, "name": "canada", "path": "/society/canada"}], "supercategory": "leisure", "venue": {"id": 1247, "name": "Jodrell Lecture Theatre", "slug": "jodrell-lecture-theatre", "city": "Richmond", "postcode": "TW9 3DS"}, "organizer": {"id": 1453, "name": "Sustainable Uses Group", "slug": "sustainable-uses-group"}, "date": "2009-10-20", "dates": [{"id": 7364, "from_date": "2009-10-20", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "17:00:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": "Admission is free but must be prebooked using:\r\nhttp://www.eventbee.com/view/nancyturner/event?eventid=62117", "additional_info": "The Jodrell Laboratory is accessed via the Jodrell Gate on Kew Road, equidistant between Kew Bridge and Kew Gardens stations.

The conference has an international profile attracting delegates from around the world with the aim of encouraging dialogue and discussion. Past conferences have attracted a wide range of internationally renowned speakers, from the World Health Organisation, United Nations, Government and NGOs.\r\n\r\nThe 2008 Medsin National Conference will look at the nature and distribution of power in global health and consider health in the context of international politics, economics and society.   In doing so, we hope to enable these future healthcare workers to understand the wider social context of their profession.  Finally we also seek to motivate these students to address questions of how we as students can engage with the democratic process to empower the disenfranchised.\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 480, "image_id": null, "added": "2008-09-17T04:23:32", "slug": "medsin-national-conference-power-politics-in-global-health", "speakers": [{"id": 2659, "name": "Mr Martin Wolf", "slug": "mr-martin-wolf"}, {"id": 7296, "name": "PhD infectious diseases Elizabeth Pisani", "slug": "phd-infectious-diseases-elizabeth-pisani"}, {"id": 7297, "name": "Professor Nancy Scheper-Hughes", "slug": "professor-nancy-scheper-hughes"}, {"id": 7298, "name": "Professor Maureen Mackintosh", "slug": "professor-maureen-mackintosh"}, {"id": 6156, "name": "Mr Richard Wilkinson", "slug": "mr-richard-wilkinson"}, {"id": 7300, "name": "Professor Jonathan Woolf", "slug": "professor-jonathan-woolf"}, {"id": 7115, "name": "Dr Richard Horton", "slug": "dr-richard-horton"}, {"id": 7309, "name": "Clare Short MP", "slug": "clare-short-mp"}], "topics": [{"id": 1029, "name": "health", "path": "/science/medicine/health"}, {"id": 1480, "name": "health", "path": "/science/beauty/health"}, {"id": 299, "name": "health", "path": "/academic/health"}, {"id": 300, "name": "health", "path": "/politics/health"}], "supercategory": "science", "venue": {"id": 1762, "name": "Cruciform Lecture Theatre, University College London", "slug": "cruciform-lecture-theatre-university-college-london", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC1E 6BT"}, "organizer": {"id": 1478, "name": "Medsin UCL", "slug": "medsin-ucl"}, "date": "2008-10-25", "dates": [{"id": 6086, "from_date": "2008-10-25", "to_date": "2008-10-25", "time": "9:00:00", "ticket_cost": "Entry only valid with ticket.

His major anthology of poetries of innovation and renewal, Poems for the Millenium, co-edited with Pierre Joris, was published in two volumes by the University of California Press (1995 and 1998). He is also a founder of Ethnopoetics, a commitment to the study and translation of tribal and pre-modern texts (oral and written) in a context of ethnographic investigation. His two large collections of translations, Technicians of the Sacred (1968) and Shaking the Pumpkin (1972), have been key markers in our understanding of the aliveness and complexity of the verbal art of non-modern societies. He also co-edited Alcheringa, the first journal of ethnopoetics.He has published several books of essays, including The Book of the Book (2000, with Steven Clay), and Prefaces (1981).\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 60, "image_id": null, "added": "2007-09-11T11:22:18", "slug": "the-life-of-the-avant-gardefrom-romanticism-to-the-present", "speakers": [{"id": 5873, "name": "Jerome Rothenberg", "slug": "jerome-rothenberg"}], "topics": [{"id": 1317, "name": "poetry", "path": "/arts/books/poetry/poetry"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 487, "name": "Birkbeck College", "slug": "birkbeck-college", "city": "LONDON", "postcode": "WC1E 7HX"}, "organizer": {"id": 1269, "name": "Birkbeck Institute for the Humanities", "slug": "birkbeck-institute-for-the-humanities"}, "date": "2007-10-04", "dates": [{"id": 4834, "from_date": "2007-10-04", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "18:00:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": null, "additional_info": null, "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 487, "name": "Birkbeck College", "slug": "birkbeck-college", "city": "LONDON", "postcode": "WC1E 7HX"}, "organizer": {"id": 1269, "name": "Birkbeck Institute for the Humanities", "slug": "birkbeck-institute-for-the-humanities"}}]}, {"id": 4515, "title": "Adult  Workshop -  How to Release and maximise your Creativity.

On Thursday 15 December, he will present his ideas at a debate on the future of creativity and innovation at the Dana Centre – the Science Museum’s bar and café dedicated to discussing contemporary and controversial science.\r\n\r\nThe discussion is the fifth in a series of Christmas Lectures conducted by Cybersalon, a pioneer of critical debate and a platform for breakthroughs in new media and digital art, and NMK, which supports and develops the UK's emerging digital media industries. The series exists as an opportunity for leading members of those industries to talk freely about their work, and to speculate about the effect of media and communications technologies on society, economics, politics and culture. \r\n\r\nAt the Christmas lecture, Cybersalon and NMK will also launch a new research project and publication initiative, ‘Sorted’.\r\n“In tomorrow's living room, the mobile phone is a remote control unit that runs your computer games, your television and the videoconferencing calls you make to your granny (she has a Webcam, too),” said Professor  Woudhuysen.  \r\n\r\n“But what kind of creative content can we expect to see on wall-sized, wafer-thin TVs that are coming. And will the homes of the future be built efficiently enough for young people to be able to afford them?\r\n\r\n“The educated classes in Britain talk a lot about both this nation’s strengths in creativity, and its need to accelerate innovation in the face of challenges from Asia.\r\n\r\n“Yet from consumer electronics to construction and transport, government is more interested in cutting down energy use than in turning British science into technological breakthroughs. \r\n\r\n“That’s a shame. All over British and European industry, and especially in services, there is not nearly enough of the right kind of R&D going on. By contrast, the regulation of science and technology, by both Whitehall and Brussels, has grown apace.\r\n\r\n“I will be examining some of today’s barriers to successful innovation, and showing how we can overcome them.”\r\n\r\nKat Nilsson, head of programmes at the Dana Centre, said:  “This is a fantastic opportunity for the Dana Centre to debate the future landscape of innovation.  The Centre exists to engage audiences with exciting and contemporary innovations in science, medicine and technology.”\r\n\r\nIn previous Cybersalon Christmas lectures, Eva Pascoe has described her experiences in founding Cyberia, the world's first Internet Café, and how Internet Cafes have continued to evolve and impact on society. Professor Jonathan Briggs has discussed the role of Internet technologies in helping to rebuild war-torn Kosova. Journalist Bill Thompson has wondered if big business is destroying the Internet, and Dr Richard Barbrook has pondered the shape of Nets to come.

Understanding cellular events involving myosin has been a driving force in the development and application of biophysical techniques such as synchrotron radiation and the manipulation and study of single molecules.", "additional_info": null, "duration": 480, "image_id": 84, "added": "2004-04-30T09:05:33", "slug": "myosin-muscle-and-motility", "speakers": [{"id": 302, "name": "Organised by:", "slug": "organised-by"}, {"id": 303, "name": "Professor Kenneth Holmes FRS", "slug": "professor-kenneth-holmes-frs"}, {"id": 304, "name": "Dr David Trentham FRS", "slug": "dr-david-trentham-frs"}, {"id": 305, "name": "Professor Robert Simmons FRS", "slug": "professor-robert-simmons-frs"}], "topics": [{"id": 171, "name": "muscles", "path": "/science/biology/muscles"}, {"id": 172, "name": "motility", "path": "/science/biology/motility"}], "supercategory": "science", "venue": {"id": 44, "name": "The Royal Society", "slug": "the-royal-society", "city": "London", "postcode": "SW1Y 5AG"}, "organizer": {"id": 44, "name": "The Royal Society", "slug": "the-royal-society"}, "date": "2004-05-17", "dates": [{"id": 226, "from_date": "2004-05-17", "to_date": "2004-05-17", "time": "10:00:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": "Register here:\r\n<a href=\"https://www.royalsoc.ac.uk/events/forms/may04_form.htm\">https://www.royalsoc.ac.uk/events/forms/may04_form.htm</a>", "additional_info": "Two day event: 17 and 18 May.\r\n\r\nFree entry.
