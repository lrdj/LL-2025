Through short lectures and lively discussion, the event will delve into challenging questions around women’s careers, family lives and roles in the political movements of this period.\r\nProgramme\r\n6.00pm: Drinks reception\r\n6.15pm:\r\nExhibition tour of ‘This vexed question’ (pre-book only, places are limited)\r\n7.00pm: Short talks: \r\nBattles not yet won: women doctors between the Wars Dr Lesley Hall\r\nVexing Questions for Medical Women, 1860-1918 Dr Claire Brock\r\n7.40pm:\r\nLesley Hall and Claire Brock in conversation with Royal College of Physicians museum curator, Dr Kristin Hussey\r\n8.15pm (approx.): Exhibition viewing and pay bar\r\n9.00pm: Close\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 180, "image_id": 2584, "added": "2018-12-06T16:50:53", "slug": "41c06cf3185f057e", "speakers": [{"id": 10887, "name": "Dr Lesley Hall", "slug": "dr-lesley-hall"}, {"id": 16912, "name": "Dr Claire  Brock", "slug": "dr-claire-brock"}], "topics": [{"id": 1397, "name": "medicine", "path": "/academic/science/philosophy/engineering/biology/medicine"}, {"id": 170, "name": "newtopic", "path": "/science/chemistry/biochemistry/catalysis/newtopic"}, {"id": 2692, "name": "history", "path": "/arts/finearts/film/film/history"}, {"id": 106, "name": "wwi", "path": "/arts/books/history/military/wwi"}], "supercategory": "academic", "venue": {"id": 2684, "name": "Royal College of Physicians", "slug": "royal-college-of-physicians", "city": "London", "postcode": "NW1 4LE"}, "organizer": {"id": 2684, "name": "Royal College of Physicians", "slug": "royal-college-of-physicians"}, "date": "2018-11-12", "dates": [{"id": 16894, "from_date": "2018-11-12", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "18:00:00", "ticket_cost": "£8 (students and concessions £5) including a free drink", "ticket_info": "https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/in-conversation-activism-medicine-and-the-fight-for-equality-tickets-48405213296", "additional_info": "Event Phone Number:\r\n020 3075 1543\r\nEvent Email Address:\r\nhistory@rcplondon.ac.uk \r\n\r\n", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 2684, "name": "Royal College of Physicians", "slug": "royal-college-of-physicians", "city": "London", "postcode": "NW1 4LE"}, "organizer": {"id": 2684, "name": "Royal College of Physicians", "slug": "royal-college-of-physicians"}}]}, {"id": 16343, "title": "\"Leo Abse and the Reform of the Sexual Offences Acts\"", "synopsis": "William Cross, author of THE ABERGAVENNY WITCH HUNT, a case from 1942 that saw the prosecution of over 20 homosexuals in a small Welsh town looks at the changes made to the law in 1967 by Leo Abse and others", "keywords": "Leo Abse, sexual law reform.

This has induced fantasies of control, the capability to shape technology and the depiction of consumer choice as the ultimate expression of individual autonomy. Still, the more choices are available, the more we feel surrounded by uncertainty; similar to the dark energy in the universe. Coping with uncertainty raises questions about the limits of what can be predicted. While unprecedented computational power increases the amount of data and hence complexity, it promises at the same time ever more certainty. Yet the cunning of uncertainty is at work underneath these forays into managing complexity.\r\n\r\nScience thrives at the cusp of uncertainty and its cunning operates in creative ways. Today, the promises of innovation dominate the political agenda, while downplaying the inherent uncertainty and its forces of creative destruction. In the social world intervention and manipulation cannot be pursued like in an experimental system. The cunning of uncertainty is at work through competition and the strategies to influence its outcome. Innovation cannot be planned, but ‚trading zones’ offer new spaces for negotiating uncertainty. Finally, what about errors and their propagation, leading to false certainties? If society is to thrive at the cusp of uncertainty, instead of being stifled by it, the openness of the future and the degrees of freedom which uncertainty offers need to be embraced.\r\n\r\nHelga Nowotny is President of the European Research Council (ERC).

Events of the Irish revolution are often viewed through a nationalist prism, but during this period significant class struggles took place, of which the Lock-out is the most remembered.\r\n\r\nThe Dublin lock-out was the single greatest confrontation between the forces of labour and capital in Irish history, with 300 employers pitted against approximately 20,000 workers and their 80,000 dependants. It lasted from August 1913 to January 1914.\r\n\r\nThe workers in the dispute were led by the charismatic James Larkin, who sought to mobilise the city’s poverty-stricken unskilled labour force in order to bring about improved pay and conditions. A consortium of Dublin businessmen forced all remaining employees to sign a pledge never to join or support a trade union. All employees who refused to sign were sacked or locked out, with strike-breakers brought in by employers where possible.\r\n\r\nIt was a dispute during which international solidarity and the tactic of the sympathetic strikes were central to the workers. Larkin succeeded in bringing socialist politics to a very significant percentage of the Dublin working class. The lock-out marked a watershed moment in Irish labour culture by firmly asserting worker solidarity.\r\n\r\nJoining Danny will be Donnacha Delong who will discuss ‘Misfit: A Revolutionary Life’  the autobiography of Irish revolutionary Captain Jack White, which has recently been republished.\r\n\r\nJack White was one of the founders of the Irish Citizens Army, a small group of trained trade union volunteers established in Dublin for the defence of worker’s demonstrations from the police. Other prominent members included James Connolly, Seán O'Casey, Constance Markievicz, and Francis Sheehy-Skeffington. In 1916, it took part in the Easter Rising – an armed insurrection aimed at ending British rule in Ireland.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhite later went to Spain with the International Brigade and became an anarchist, working with the CNT and Emma Goldman.\r\nCopies of ‘Misfit: A Revolutionary Life’ and other related books will be available on the evening.", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 1944, "added": "2013-08-24T10:43:29", "slug": "4f011beb74572c1d", "speakers": [{"id": 13911, "name": "Daniel Finn", "slug": "daniel-finn"}, {"id": 13912, "name": "Donnacha DeLong", "slug": "donnacha-delong"}], "topics": [{"id": 3241, "name": "class", "path": "/society/social/socialstatus/class"}, {"id": 3048, "name": "class", "path": "/society/unitedstates/class"}, {"id": 3442, "name": "class", "path": "/politics/class/class"}, {"id": 2435, "name": "labour", "path": "/politics/government/labour"}], "supercategory": "society", "venue": {"id": 2783, "name": "Housmans Bookshop", "slug": "housmans-bookshop", "city": "London", "postcode": "N1 9DX"}, "organizer": {"id": 2783, "name": "Housmans Bookshop", "slug": "housmans-bookshop"}, "date": "2013-09-25", "dates": [{"id": 13224, "from_date": "2013-09-25", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "19:00:00", "ticket_cost": "Entry £3, redeemable against any purchase", "ticket_info": "At the door on the night", "additional_info": "HOW TO FIND US:\r\nWe're very easy to find - just a two minute walk from King's Cross/St.Pancras terminals.

Today, exciting scientific advances provide new insight into this cosmological mystery: Not only can something arise from nothing, something will always arise from nothing.  Lawrence Krauss will present a mind-bending trip, based on his bestselling new book, back to the beginning of the beginning and the end of the end, reviewing the remarkable developments in cosmology and particle physics over the past 20 years that have revolutionized our picture of the origin of the universe, and of its future. In the process, it has become clear that not only can our universe naturally arise from nothing, but that it probably did.  \r\n\r\nLawrence M. Krauss is a renowned cosmologist and science popularizer, and is Foundation Professor in the School of Earth and Space Exploration, and director of the Origins Project at Arizona State University. Hailed by Scientific American as a rare public intellectual, he is also the author of more than three hundred scientific publications and nine books, including the international bestseller, The Physics of Star Trek, and his most recent bestseller entitled A Universe from Nothing|, now being translated into 17 languages.  He received his PhD from MIT in 1982 and then joined the Society of Fellows at Harvard, and was a professor at Yale University and Chair of the Physics Department at Case Western Reserve University before taking his present position. Internationally known for his work in theoretical physics, he is the winner of numerous international awards, and is the only physicist to have received major awards from all three US physics societies, the American Physical Society, the American Institute of Physics, and the American Association of Physics Teachers.   Krauss is also a commentator and essayist for newspapers such as the New York Times, and the Wall St. Journal, and has written regular columns for New Scientist, Scientific American, and Slate, and appears regularly on radio and television. He serves as co-chair of the Board of Sponsors of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, and on the Board of Directors of the Federation of American Scientists. \r\n\r\nSuggested hashtag for this event for Twitter users: #LSEuniverse", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 732, "added": "2012-09-14T17:36:05", "slug": "a-universe-from-nothing", "speakers": [{"id": 12805, "name": "Professor Lawrence M.

Foreign soldiers and merchants tore apart the great empires which had once formed the heart of civilization. It was clear that for Asia to recover a vast intellectual effort would be required.\r\n\r\nPankaj Mishra’s fascinating new book tells the story of a remarkable group of men from across the continent who met the challenge of the West. Incessantly travelling, questioning and agonising, they both hated the West and recognised that an Asian renaissance needed to be fuelled in part by engagement with the enemy. Through many setbacks and wrong turns, a powerful, contradictory and ultimately unstoppable series of ideas were created that now lie behind everything from the Chinese Communist Party to Al Qaeda, from Indian nationalism to the Muslim Brotherhood.\r\n\r\nPankaj will discuss this, with a question and answer session to follow, and the opportunity to purchase copies of the book for signing.\r\n\r\nPankaj Mishra is the author of Butter Chicken in Ludhiana, The Romantics, An End to Suffering and Temptations of the West.

Literature in an age of ‘globish’", "synopsis": "Is it ever valid to judge literature with reference to its nationality, linguistic distinctions aside? Are some national traditions simply more important than others?", "keywords": "Books, literature, Culture, World", "body": "‘Nothing human is alien to me,’ claimed Roman playwright Terence in the second century BC. If he were alive today, he might find good company among 21st century readers. Browsing the shelves of a high-street bookstore, one easily find see a range of world literature, from Chinua Achebe to Zadie Smith; international literature prizes and festivals abound, while World Book Day has become a fixture in the literary calendar. The Nobel Prize for Literature continues to offer a snapshot of the global literati even if, as is alleged by some, it may never again be won by an American.\r\n\r\nYet while the Nobel committee proclaims that it ‘is not a contest between nations’ there can be no denying that national literature has a particular place in the literary consciousness. Whether it is ‘imperial’ writers such as Virgil or Spenser, or modern nationalists such as Yeats and Mahmoud Darwish, or distinct national bodies of literature (19th century Russian, 20th century American and English), we certainly use nationality as a shorthand when talking about literature. To take America as an example, there can be no doubt that its writers influenced each other in developing a distinctive body of literature: from Henry James and Edith Wharton to Ezra Pound and TS Eliot, Hemingway and Faulkner, Updike and Roth, Pynchon and DeLillo… Today celebrating indigenous or foreign language writers has become the hallmark of a cosmopolitan sophistication or Western intellectual guilt, depending on your perspective. Genres such as ‘Jewish’ or ‘immigrant’ literature, meanwhile, find commonalities between peoples that transcend geographical location but imply a certain specific cultural bond.\r\n\r\nIs it ever valid to judge literature with reference to its nationality, linguistic distinctions aside? Are some national traditions simply more important than others? Or, to paraphrase Oscar Wilde, does it matter more to the modern reader whether books are well written or badly written? Is the interest in global literature evidence of a rootless cosmopolitanism, hostile to the influence of the social and political realities of a particular author’s nationality and cultural background?

At the launch of the government’s social mobility strategy Opening Doors, Breaking Barriers, he revealed that early in his career, family friend Lord Carrington had arranged for him to take up a position at the European Commission. ‘I’m not the slightest bit ashamed of saying that we all inhabited a system which was wrong,’ he said. Subsequently the coalition has divided over its plans for ‘fairer’ internships, but it remains united in the conviction that social mobility in the UK is unacceptably low, and that education is both a cause of and a solution to the problem. Education secretary Michael Gove chides those who see deprivation as destiny, and promises ‘urgent, focused, radical action’. Schools, he argues, should become ‘engines of social mobility’. The Opening Doors strategy suggests what happens to pupils in their school years will ‘to a great extent, determine their future life chances’. It concludes that social mobility could be improved by raising educational standards, providing extra funding for the disadvantaged, and ensuring better careers advice.\r\n\r\nCertainly, the OECD rates the UK very poorly for social mobility compared with other developed countries. But some argue social mobility is just one aspect of a broader problem of inequality or disadvantage, and that a narrow focus on individual opportunities is a distraction from bigger issues, such as the lack of good jobs and general economic dynamism. So should we be focusing on creating better opportunities for all rather than bickering over who gets the few cushy jobs? Or is it a matter of principle that every child should have an equal chance of advancing in any given career? \r\n\r\nInitiatives such as the English Baccalaureate, which will encourage state schools to teach traditional high status subjects, are designed to level the playing field. But will positioning schools as ‘engines of social mobility’ just give them yet another set of distracting political objectives that they are ill-equipped to address? Is social mobility the right issue to focus on, or does it offer little more than escape route for the lucky few, leaving wider social inequality untouched?", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 1566, "added": "2011-09-10T20:31:57", "slug": "b2ce24329d071fe9", "speakers": [{"id": 11427, "name": "Christine  Blower", "slug": "christine-blower"}, {"id": 11428, "name": "Stephen  Gorard", "slug": "stephen-gorard"}, {"id": 10122, "name": "Siôn Humphreys", "slug": "siôn-humphreys"}, {"id": 10120, "name": "Sally Millard", "slug": "sally-millard"}, {"id": 11429, "name": "David  Skelton", "slug": "david-skelton"}, {"id": 5860, "name": "Toby Marshall", "slug": "toby-marshall"}], "topics": [{"id": 123, "name": "mobility", "path": "/society/urbanisation/planning/mobility"}, {"id": 743, "name": "education", "path": "/academic/arts/linguistics/education"}, {"id": 744, "name": "education", "path": "/academic/linguistics/education"}, {"id": 745, "name": "education", "path": "/arts/language/education"}], "supercategory": "society", "venue": {"id": 1636, "name": "Hamilton House", "slug": "hamilton-house", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC1H 9BD"}, "organizer": {"id": 45, "name": "Institute of Ideas", "slug": "institute-of-ideas"}, "date": "2011-10-06", "dates": [{"id": 10515, "from_date": "2011-10-06", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "19:00:00", "ticket_cost": "£7.50 (£5 concessions) per person", "ticket_info": "Tickets are available from the Institute of Ideas website.\r\nhttp://www.instituteofideas.com/tickets/battlesatellites2011.html", "additional_info": "visit www.battleofideas.org.uk", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 1636, "name": "Hamilton House", "slug": "hamilton-house", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC1H 9BD"}, "organizer": {"id": 45, "name": "Institute of Ideas", "slug": "institute-of-ideas"}}]}, {"id": 10068, "title": "Changing Fortunes: income mobility and poverty dynamics in Britain", "synopsis": "CASE book launch and debate", "keywords": "economics, social policy, income, britain, poverty, mobility, LSE", "body": "Stephen Jenkins launches his book, Changing Fortunes: income mobility and poverty dynamics in Britain, a comprehensive and original study of how people's incomes change between one year and the next.\r\n\r\nStephen Jenkins is professor of economic and social policy at LSE.\r\n\r\nJohn Hills is professor of social policy and director of the Centre for the Analysis of Social Exclusion (CASE) at LSE.\r\n\r\nSimon Burgess is professor of economics and director of the Centre for Market and\r\nPublic Organisation (CMPO), University of Bristol.", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 732, "added": "2011-09-07T13:29:06", "slug": "d9cd37b65accc19a", "speakers": [{"id": 11385, "name": "Professor Stephen Jenkins", "slug": "professor-stephen-jenkins"}, {"id": 11386, "name": "Respondent: Professor Simon Burgess", "slug": "respondent-professor-simon-burgess"}, {"id": 5301, "name": "Professor Sir John Hills", "slug": "professor-sir-john-hills"}, {"id": 11387, "name": "Chair: Professor Mike Brewer", "slug": "chair-professor-mike-brewer"}], "topics": [{"id": 123, "name": "mobility", "path": "/society/urbanisation/planning/mobility"}, {"id": 2493, "name": "income", "path": "/business/economy/publicpolicy/income"}, {"id": 1649, "name": "policy", "path": "/politics/environment/environment/policy"}, {"id": 1239, "name": "economics", "path": "/politics/economics/latinamerica/economics"}], "supercategory": "society", "venue": {"id": 2130, "name": "New Theatre", "slug": "new-theatre", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC2A 2AE"}, "organizer": {"id": 1287, "name": "London School of Economics & Political Science", "slug": "london-school-of-economics-political-science"}, "date": "2011-10-03", "dates": [{"id": 10487, "from_date": "2011-10-03", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "18:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": "Suggested hashtag for this event for Twitter users: #lsejenkins\r\n\r\nThis event is supported by the ESRC Research Centre on Micro Social Change at\r\nISER, University of Essex.\r\n\r\nThis event is free and open to all with no ticket required.

It will examine Spare’s primary techniques, including the Death Posture, the Neither-Neither principle and his philosophy of Self-Love, considering them in the context of the artist’s key influences.  The lecture will be illustrated throughout with large projections of Spare’s art, many from the Fulgur archives. The evening will appeal to long-established devotees and newcomers alike.\r\n\r\nRobert Ansell is a leading expert on Austin Spare. He first encountered the artist over 20 years ago in his career with the fine art auctioneers Sotheby’s. In 1992 he co-founded Fulgur Limited with the aim of creating ‘a nexus between the creative current that informs the work of Austin Osman Spare and modern collectors and students of the occult.’ Since then, Fulgur has published most of the key works by and about the artist, including: Zos Speaks!, Images and Oracles of Austin Osman Spare, The Book of Ugly Ecstasy and Borough Satyr: The Life and Art of Austin Osman Spare.

He was answered by a clergyman, who concluded the reply with the deprecatory expression, “I fear that he has denied his Saviour.”  In his rejoinder he pleaded, “Oh, no! we only denied the Devil.” But the clergyman failed to perceive the difference.  In his conception of the matter, the denying of the personal objective existence of the Devil was itself “the sin against the Holy Ghost.”\r\nThis necessary Evil, dignified by the epithet of “Father of Lies,” was, according to the clergy, the founder of all the world-religions of ancient time, and of the heresies, or rather heterodoxies, of later periods, as well as the Dues ex Machine of modern Spiritualism. In the exceptions which we take to this notion, we protest that we do not attack true religion or sincere piety.  We are only carrying on a controversy with human dogmas.  Perhaps in doing this we resemble Don Quixote, because these things are only windmills.  Nevertheless, let it be remembered that they have been the occasion and pretext for the slaughtering of more than fifty millions of human beings since the words were proclaimed: “LOVE YOUR ENEMIES.”*\r\nIt is a late day for us to expect the Christian clergy to undo and amend their work. They have too much at stake.  If the Christian Church should abandon or even modify the dogma of an anthropomorphic devil, it would be like pulling the bottom card from under a castle of cards.  The structure would fall.  The clergymen to whom we have alluded perceived that upon the relinquishing of Satan as a personal devil, the dogma of Jesus Christ as the second deity in their trinity must go over in the same catastrophe. Incredible, or even horrifying, as it may seem, the Roman Church bases its doctrine of the godhood of Christ entirely upon the Satanism of the fallen archangel.  We have the testimony of Father Ventura, who proclaims the vital importance of this dogma to the Catholics.\r\nThe Reverend Father Ventura, the illustrious ex-general of the Théatins, certifies that the Chevalier des Mousseaux, by his treatise, Mœurs et Pratiques des Démons, has deserved well of mankind, and still more of the most Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church.  With this voucher, the noble Chevalier, it will be perceived, “speaks as one having authority.”  He asserts explicitly, that to the Devil and his angels we are absolutely indebted for our Saviour; and that but for them we would have no Redeemer, no Christianity.\"  [Isis Unveiled Vol ii, p 478/9]\r\n* Gospel according to Matthew, v. 44.\r\n\r\nThe tenants of Theosophy are absolute Brotherhood among all men and Charity & Altruism first and foremost.\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 518, "added": "2006-01-16T15:07:06", "slug": "cd6ac5de71f0b34d", "speakers": [{"id": 3522, "name": "a student at ULT", "slug": "a-student-at-ult"}], "topics": [{"id": 414, "name": "philosophy", "path": "/society/history/philosophy"}, {"id": 316, "name": "philosophy", "path": "/arts/art/philosophy"}, {"id": 537, "name": "philosophy", "path": "/arts/theatre/philosophy"}, {"id": 825, "name": "philosophy", "path": "/academic/philosophy/philosophy"}, {"id": 863, "name": "theosophy", "path": "/religion/theosophy"}, {"id": 863, "name": "theosophy", "path": "/religion/theosophy"}, {"id": 95, "name": "interfaith", "path": "/religion/interfaith"}, {"id": 96, "name": "hinduism", "path": "/religion/hinduism"}, {"id": 174, "name": "ethics", "path": "/science/ethics"}, {"id": 163, "name": "philosophy", "path": "/science/philosophy"}, {"id": 148, "name": "psychology", "path": "/science/psychology"}], "supercategory": "society", "venue": {"id": 927, "name": "United Lodge of Theosophists", "slug": "united-lodge-of-theosophists", "city": "London", "postcode": "W2 3AH"}, "organizer": {"id": 927, "name": "United Lodge of Theosophists", "slug": "united-lodge-of-theosophists"}, "date": "2006-02-05", "dates": [{"id": 2861, "from_date": "2006-02-05", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "19:00:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": null, "additional_info": "Venue is near Paddington and Lancaster gate underground stations - call 020 7723 0688 for queries.", "members_only": "No", "members_info": "No membership required.

However, increasingly, planners, developers and the wider public are understanding that artists can have a much greater impact on the development of our cities, from influencing the decisions of masterplanners, engaging with innovative public consultation processes, to providing a vision as to how the public environment might need to evolve and adapt to accommodate the changing needs of visitors and residents.\r\n\r\nExecutive Member for Regeneration, Community and Leisure at Preston City Council, Councillor Veronica Afrin, explains, “These talks will inform future debates in the city about how we can best use the diverse skills of artists to improve the quality of life of all of its inhabitants.  Traditionally artists’ involvement has been limited to making art for public spaces but there are a host of other possibilities which we are now in a position to explore.  These talks will bring together examples of best practice from across the country and will be invaluable in developing our plans in Preston.\" \r\n\r\nSpeaking of Art is part of the In Certain Places project which includes the Tithebarn Lead Artist scheme and Here + Now temporary public art project.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUrban View Speakers:\r\n\r\n\t23 November 2005\r\nThe Making (and remaking) of the Preston Landscape.\r\nDr David Hunt, Local Historian\r\n\r\nDavid Hunt was born in Preston in 1955. He studied Economic and Social history at Dundee, before taking an MA in Archaeology at Durham and returning to Dundee to study a PH.D in prehistoric archaeology. As curator of the small community museum at Leyland in 1982, he began to research and lecture on the history of the district with particular reference to the cotton industry. A series of local studies began with the 'History of Leyland' (1990), Preston (sponsored by the Borough Council for the 1992 Guild), and Walton-le-Dale (1997). From 1996-2002 he was the first Visiting Fellow in Local & Regional History at the University of Central Lancashire. \r\n\r\nRecent publications include, 'Preston: Centuries of Change' (2003) and 'The Wharncliffe Guide to the Local History of Preston' (2005) and 'Power, Politics and the People, A Social History of Preston North End FC' (2000).\r\n\r\n\r\n30 November 2005\r\nRisking the Unknown City:\r\nProf. Iain Borden, Architectural Historian and Urban Commentator.\r\n\r\nRisking the Unknown City: “ The public spaces of the city should bring together the micro and the macro, the everyday and the spectacular, the inside and the outside, work and leisure, the durable and the ephemeral . . . they should be situated between the practised, the conceived and the imagined. In this kind of city, not knowing allows the city to become familiar yet strange, comforting yet challenging, safe yet exhilarating, a catalyst to thoughts and actions.” \r\n\r\nIain Borden is Head of the Bartlett School of Architecture, UCL, where he is Professor of Architecture and Urban Culture. An architectural historian and urban commentator, his wide-ranging interests have lead to publications on critical theory and architectural historical methodology, boundaries and surveillance, Henri Lefebvre and Georg Simmel, film and architecture, gender and architecture, body spaces and the experience of space. His books include Manual: the Architecture and Office of Allford Hall Monaghan Morris (2003), Skateboarding Space and the City (2001) and The Unknown City (2001).

He currently teaches at the Architectural Association, London and is a founding member of Public Works.\r\n\r\nPublic Works is an art/architecture collective consisting of Architects Sandra Denicke-Polcher, Torange Khonsari, Andreas Lang and Artists Kathrin Böhm and Stefan Saffer. The team has been collaborating since 1998 and specialise in consultation and design projects for public spaces and institutions. Their interest lies in the relationship between institutions that offer and govern public space, and the users of those spaces.  Public Works create designs which address and articulate the dynamics and agendas of both groups; to find architectural solutions that bridge the contradicting interests. The group use on-site interventions in order to continuously feed the brief making and design process in both master planning and building projects.  Their contribution as artists/architects is to propose and implement communication and physical structures that support and make use of the existing local networks and resources and at the same time offer, propose and stimulate new activities and ways of exchange.\r\n\r\nThe programme is developed by the Harris Museum and Art Gallery and University of Central Lancashire and funded by Arts Council England.\r\n\r\nAll lectures are on Wednesdays at 6pm in the Green Bank Lecture Theatre, University of Central Lancashire, Preston.\r\n\r\nAll events are free, but booking is essential.

Featuring works by Christian Phillip Müller, Nancy Davenport and Jakob Jakobson, Campus interrogates the contemporary university as a nexus of spatial, cultural, commercial and intellectual practices.\r\n\r\nTo interface with Campus, a panel discussion and international ‘think-tank’ session (by video link) is being set up to discuss the radical reconceptualisation of the university – especially in light of current pressures on universities to become economically productive rather than just cost effective.  \r\n\r\nIn enlarging on this central theme, a number of sub-strands may also arise during the link-event.  For example, what is the role of the artist both within the university and within the so-called ‘creative economy’ in general?  Or, given that the figure of the artist is increasingly read as epitomising the (successful) coalition between creativity, entrepreneurship and the knowledge economy, what ought the function of the artist be within the university of the future?  Should universities, for example, be specifically organised around the creation of ‘knowledge capital’?  Alternatively, does the function of the university radically change in accordance with its different locations across the world?  \r\n\r\nAgain, in all cases, the question asked is whether or not universities are in need of a radical overhaul if they are to be capable of conveying existing flows of knowledge from education for the benefit of culture?  To cut across these questions then (and to generate some additional questions), the artists Jakob Jakobson (Co-founder of the Free University of Copenhagen) and Hans Breder (renowned multi-media artist) have also been invited to participate in the link-event by way of performance and/or discussion.  \r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 120, "image_id": null, "added": "2005-09-29T21:58:11", "slug": "re-inventing-the-university", "speakers": [{"id": 3091, "name": "Prof Herman Rapaport", "slug": "prof-herman-rapaport"}, {"id": 3092, "name": "Dr Jaime Stapleton", "slug": "dr-jaime-stapleton"}, {"id": 3093, "name": "Dr Les Carr", "slug": "dr-les-carr"}, {"id": 258, "name": "Saul Albert", "slug": "saul-albert"}, {"id": 3094, "name": "Dr Bernadette Buckley", "slug": "dr-bernadette-buckley"}, {"id": 3095, "name": "Christian Phillip Muller", "slug": "christian-phillip-muller"}], "topics": [{"id": 743, "name": "education", "path": "/academic/arts/linguistics/education"}, {"id": 744, "name": "education", "path": "/academic/linguistics/education"}, {"id": 745, "name": "education", "path": "/arts/language/education"}], "supercategory": "academic", "venue": {"id": 272, "name": "John Hansard Gallery, University of Southampton", "slug": "john-hansard-gallery-university-of-southampton", "city": "Southampton", "postcode": "SO17 1BJ"}, "organizer": {"id": 272, "name": "John Hansard Gallery, University of Southampton", "slug": "john-hansard-gallery-university-of-southampton"}, "date": "2005-10-06", "dates": [{"id": 2524, "from_date": "2005-10-06", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "19:00:00", "ticket_cost": "FREE", "ticket_info": null, "additional_info": "Admission is free.

British  arts and craft  influenced work throughout Europe, America and Japan with each country developing their own local styles and techniques. New fashion also evolved from the movement, often both worn and designed by its followers. Many European countries devised national dress based on regional styles, while at the same time designers in Glasgow and in Vienna created more forward-looking and original clothing. \r\n\r\nThe day will focus on the origins of the international movement and many of its most original and influential exponents.\r\n\r\nThe event will be chaired by Lou Taylor, Professor of Dress and Textile History at the University of Brighton and Linda Parry, Deputy Keeper, Furniture, Textiles and Fashion department V&A.\r\nSessions will include:\r\n\t\r\nHead, Heart and Hand : A session highlighting the work of individual artists, designers and craftspeople in Britain, America, Europe and Japan from 1885 until 1914.\r\nLinda Parry, Deputy Keeper, Furniture, Textiles and Fashion Department V&A.\r\n\r\nTraditional and Techno : A look at the work of contemporary textile artists who mix traditional studio practice with technology to  assess the influence of the Arts and Crafts Movement on the contemporary fashion industry.\r\nSue Prichard, Curator, Furniture, Textiles and Fashion Department, V&A\r\n\r\nFrom Stockholm to Tokyo : This lecture examines  the six influential styles identified by the Movement  in their search for dress that was timeless, beautiful, &#8216;natural&#8217; and hand-crafted. \r\nLou Taylor, Professor of Dress and Textile History, University of Brighton\r\n\r\nThe Glasgow Legacy : During the period 1890 to 1914 the Glasgow School of Art was a hotbed of innovative textile design, celebrated throughout Europe.
