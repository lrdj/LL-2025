She is an enigma, a member of the Irish aristocracy, her brother married Ann Amstrong-Jones ( mother of the famous Tony Armstrong- Jones, husband of Princess Margaret) “The good fairy, at Bridget’s birth, endowed her with rare gifts: exceptional looks, a probing intelligence [ and]…a unique fastidiousness..”\r\n\r\nBridget’s life spans three quarters of the 20th Century. Although she’s largely forgotten, she was at one time on the ‘A list’ of personalities. She appears in almost every diary/ memoir of the fast and furious members of British Society in the pre and post war era. Bridget pops up in the memoirs / diaries/ biographies of well known folk of her day, like the Mosleys, the Nicolsons, Nancy and Deborah Mitford, Daphne Fielding, John Betjemin, James Lees- Milne, Sacheverell Sitwell, Robin Bryans, Patrick Leigh Fermor, Clarissa Eden, Ann Fleming, Cynthia Gladwyn and Anthony Powell. These references provide a very good, colourful stock of anecdotes and observations of Bridget’s strengths and flaws. Her antics reflect her often enigmatic and changing personality, her swings of mood and struggle for independence as a modern woman.\r\n\r\nBridget never made herself an easy target for the predatory males of the time that thought all woman were a soft touch. Bridget famously hit the headlines in the 1960s in a curious Court case when she was arrested and incarcerated by the police over a petty driving offence, almost certainly revenge by one or other of her male enemies.\r\n\r\nSo who was Bridget Parsons? Why should she be remembered today?

How do we regulate our new supra-national organisations and keep them accountable (e.g. the IMF, World Bank, EU)? How do we make sense of “The New Development Bank”?

At first, disinclined to share his misery with others, he was reluctant to write about his illness. But he then came to realize that doing so provided a precious continuity with his life as a writer before contracting the disease, and a way of reaching out to a wider world that the illness made physically less accessible. Writing allowed him to address what he saw as a variety of insidious platitudes that surround cancer, often connected to the individualistic idea that the sufferer must be brave in battling the disease, with the inevitable corollary that those who succumb have, in some measure, brought it on themselves.\r\n\r\nAnd so he began to write about his illness. Not just his own symptoms and feelings, but the responses of friends to the news that he is ill and the way these reflect broader social attitudes towards the sick. He describes the political struggles occurring in St Bartholomew’s, the London hospital that cares for him, and the crisis in Britain’s National Health Service more generally, at a time of harrowing cutbacks. Big Pharma, whose drugs keep Marqusee alive but are sold to the NHS at prices reflecting the power and greed of a ruthless extortionist, is the subject for particularly astringent scrutiny.\r\n\r\nMike Marqusee is an American-born writer, journalist and political activist who has lived in Britain since 1971. He is the author of numerous books including If I Am Not for Myself: Journey of an Anti-Zionist Jew, Wicked Messenger: Bob Dylan and the Sixties, Redemption Song: Muhammad Ali and the Spirit of the Sixties, Anyone but England: An Outsider Looks at English Cricket, a novel, Slow Turn, and a collection of poetry, Street Music.

They also siphon off grant funding from schools unable to afford a digital humanities center of their own and can make it harder for scholars at such places to participate in the larger projects that help to shape the possibilities and future of the field. Are digital humanties centers crucial to the future of the field, or deleterious to it?

Prompted by recent developments, the talk wil explore whether the courtroom is really the appropriate forum for settling disputes that relate to controversial issues of belief and non-belief.\r\n\r\nFor example, the Fraudulent Mediums Act 1951, the last remnant of the old witchcraft legislation, is to be repealed in April 2008. Mediums and psychics will now be under a new and modern legal regime in respect of any unfair commercial practices. But how will these new sanctions work in practice? Will mediums and psychics who adopt questionable practices be more or less likely to face legal action?\r\n\r\nThe ancient common law offence of blasphemy may also soon be abolished. A recent High Court decision has effectively narrowed its scope in any case. There is the new offence of incitement to religious hatred. But can the legal process really deal with what can be questions of religious dispute?\r\n\r\nOther examples of where the law grapples with issues of belief and non-belief include the \"Evolution\" trials in United States, the Holocaust denal trials, and when religious groups seek to incorporate aspects of religious law into more general legal systems.\r\n\r\nThe talk will describe and assess these and other legal developments, using practical examples. It will also offer practical suggestions for both skeptics and non-skeptics on how legal regimes may affect them.\r\n\r\nDavid is a solicitor in London with wide experience of the communications, media and public sector fields.
