There had always been an alternative tradition – prior to Newton – that of lux, where the light did shine from within. That is true light for Blake, as is shown in both his writings and his paintings & graphic work. The visionary shone, illuminating the faces of those around him. Nature itself was little more than a realm of shadows; it was the Imagination which said ‘Fiat Lux’. \r\nAlan Wall is a novelist, essayist and poet. His work has been translated into ten languages. He has a particular interest in the way in which art and science interpenetrate, and has published many essays on the subject.

For this to happen they also need to be emotionally well connected to their family, peers, school and the wider community; and be given a sense of status that reflects their effort and achievements.\r\n\r\nMiriam Chachamu’s wide-reaching training day, which focuses mainly on pre-eleven year-old children, clarifies how this can be done and gives you practical tools for meeting these needs and managing challenging behaviour.\r\n\r\nIt also shows how we can create an environment in which not only children but also the rest of the family can thrive and be better equipped to fulfil their potential.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.humangivenscollege.com/courses/meeting-childrens-needs.html", "additional_info": null, "duration": 480, "image_id": 1908, "added": "2013-04-24T21:03:36", "slug": "dbdfc74fbf89ac06", "speakers": [{"id": 9559, "name": "Miriam Chachamu", "slug": "miriam-chachamu"}], "topics": [{"id": 2368, "name": "children", "path": "/science/medicine/children/children"}, {"id": 2899, "name": "children", "path": "/arts/books/19thcentury/children"}, {"id": 2036, "name": "psychotherapy", "path": "/science/psychology/psychotherapy"}, {"id": 2163, "name": "therapy", "path": "/arts/finearts/therapy"}], "supercategory": "science", "venue": {"id": 941, "name": "Friends Meeting House", "slug": "friends-meeting-house", "city": "London", "postcode": "NW1 2BJ"}, "organizer": {"id": 2602, "name": "Human Givens College", "slug": "human-givens-college"}, "date": "2013-09-10", "dates": [{"id": 12964, "from_date": "2013-09-10", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "9:30:00", "ticket_cost": "£192", "ticket_info": "Human Givens College\r\nwww.humangivenscollege.com\r\n01323 811690", "additional_info": "http://www.humangivenscollege.com/courses/meeting-childrens-needs.html", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 941, "name": "Friends Meeting House", "slug": "friends-meeting-house", "city": "London", "postcode": "NW1 2BJ"}, "organizer": {"id": 2602, "name": "Human Givens College", "slug": "human-givens-college"}}]}, {"id": 12368, "title": "ART AND REVOLUTION/ART AND POLITICS : THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION", "synopsis": "Contemporary artists all over the world are currently engaging with politics.\r\nBut there are precedents where artists reflected and defined the cultural language for some of history’s great turning points.

Originating in and mostly affecting the financial sector, it has forced central banks to take unprecedented steps to contain the situation and its fallout for the real economy. Overall, this has been achieved, and economic activity is gradually recovering around the world. Risks remain, however, including systemic risks, and the advanced economies are still a long way from achieving sustainable economic growth and job creation. \r\n\r\nJean-Claude Trichet, President of the European Central Bank (ECB), explains how his institution reacted swiftly to the challenges of the financial crisis through non-standard measures. However, at the same time, it has continued to remain faithful to its mandate of maintaining price stability in the euro area over the medium term through standard monetary policy measures. Looking ahead, Mr Trichet also argues that the unwavering actions of the ECB and its decision-making bodies need to be paralleled by a quantum leap in the economic governance of the euro area. The citizens of the euro area want stronger and better coordination of economic and financial policies and are calling for governments to deliver a deeper and more effective economic union.\r\n\r\n\r\nBorn in Lyon, Jean-Claude Trichet is an \"Ingénieur civil des Mines\", a graduate of the Institut d'études politiques de Paris and holds a Bachelor's degree in economics. He worked in the competitive sector from 1966 to 1968, attended the Ecole nationale d'administration in 1969 and was appointed \"Inspecteur adjoint des Finances\" in 1971.\r\nHe was then assigned to various posts at the Ministry of Finance in the General Inspectorate of Finance and later in the Treasury Department, where in 1976 he became Secretary General of the Interministerial Committee for Improving Industrial Structures (CIASI). \r\n\r\nJean-Claude Trichet was made an adviser to the cabinet of the Minister of Economic Affairs (René Monory) in 1978, and then an adviser to the President of the Republic (Valery Giscard d'Estaing) in the same year. In this capacity, he worked on issues relating to energy, industry, research and microeconomics from 1978 to 1981. He subsequently became Deputy Director of Bilateral Affairs at the Treasury Department from 1981 to 1984, Head of International Affairs at the Treasury and was Chairman of the Paris Club (sovereign debt rescheduling) from 1985 to 1993. In 1986, he directed the Private Office of the Minister of Economic Affairs, Finance and Privatisation (Edouard Balladur), and in 1987 he became Director of the Treasury. In the same year, he was appointed Censor of the General Council of the Banque de France and Alternate Governor of the IMF and the World Bank. He was Chairman of the European Monetary Committee from 1992 until his appointment as Governor of the Banque de France in 1993. He was the Chairman of the Monetary Policy Council of the Banque de France as of 1994, a member of the Council of the European Monetary Institute from 1994 to 1998 and thereafter a member of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank. At the end of his first term as Governor of the Banque de France, he was reappointed for a second term. \r\n\r\nJean-Claude Trichet was elected Chairman of the Group of Ten (G10) Governors on 29 June 2003. He was appointed President of the European Central Bank in October 2003, taking up the position the following month. In 2010 he became Chair of the European Systemic Risk Board. \r\n\r\nSuggested hashtag for this event for Twitter users: #lseuro \r\n\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 732, "added": "2011-05-17T13:51:00", "slug": "fd46153946caec3b", "speakers": [{"id": 11164, "name": "Jean-Claude  Trichet", "slug": "jean-claude-trichet"}, {"id": 7410, "name": "(Chair) Peter Sutherland", "slug": "chair-peter-sutherland"}], "topics": [{"id": 2482, "name": "europe", "path": "/business/economy/growth/welfare/europe"}, {"id": 2330, "name": "europe", "path": "/academic/law/intellectualpropertylaw/europe"}, {"id": 1406, "name": "euro", "path": "/business/finance/euro"}, {"id": 639, "name": "european", "path": "/arts/history/european"}], "supercategory": "business", "venue": {"id": 2277, "name": "LSE Campus, venue TBC to ticket holders", "slug": "lse-campus-venue-tbc-to-ticket-holders", "city": "London ", "postcode": "WC2A 2AE"}, "organizer": {"id": 1287, "name": "London School of Economics & Political Science", "slug": "london-school-of-economics-political-science"}, "date": "2011-06-13", "dates": [{"id": 10217, "from_date": "2011-06-13", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "14:00:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": "This event is free and open to all however a ticket is required.

The conventional mechanical compression air conditioning systems consume a significant amount of electrical energy that is largely dependent upon fossil fuel. This mode of air conditioning is therefore neither sustainable nor environment-friendly. Evaporative cooling utilizes the latent heat of water evaporation, a natural energy existing in the ambient, to perform free (or nearly free) air conditioning of buildings, and is therefore a potential replacement of the conventional systems. Evaporative cooling has its limits but a recently emerged dew point cooling technology breaks these limits and allows the supply air to be cooled to a level below the wet bulb and above the dew point of the inlet air, resulting in an increase to the systems cooling capacity. In the lecture, Professor Zhao presents the details of the new dew point cooling technology and explores its potential application in building air conditioning.\r\n\r\nProfessor Xudong Zhao is the Professor in Low Carbon Society at Institute of Energy and Sustainable Development, De Montfort University.

Early goals for public broadcasting in the US focused on equity in education and the arts, but 40-some years later has the promise of universal access to information through the Internet changed what public media can and should do?  The public broadcasting system in the US is structured with a strong local focus: in fact, local “ownership” is core to its structure.  This is quite different from the UK where the BBC provides the sole means of public service media and does so through a national network model.  During this presentation we will reflect on the differences in the two systems and explore how current changes to the media environment are changing the way in which communities can and perhaps, should, be served.  \r\n \r\nSherri Hope Culver is an Assistant Professor at Temple University in the Department of Broadcasting, Telecommunications and Mass Media.

This, however, was only the peak of a long route, along which he was trying to enter politics and influence Germany’s fate both ‘from within’ in one or another official post and ‘from without’ as member of the upper crust of Berlin’s social elite, at least since 1907/8 and then most particularly during the First World War. As a powerful industrialist and banker he had many opportunities to exrecise his influence, but being an individualist, not belonging to any party and, perhaps even more significantly a Jew, there were also many difficulties along his route. In this lecture I’ll analyze Rathenau’s career and evaluate his success as well as his failures, throwing some new light on the history of Germany and on that of its Jews during these years.\r\n\r\nShulamit Volkov, Professor of Modern History and  incumbent of the Konrad Adenauer Chair for Comparative European History at Tel Aviv University, Israel.

To make sense of it, each person must perform an act of translation or interpretation by which the strange is rendered familiar. But how should this be done? In the post-war period alone an original psychological framework has given way to that of mysticism, itself replaced in turn by the language of shamanism.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, Andy Letcher will encourage us to move away from the mushroom experience itself – the usual province of trip-lit –, to a consideration of how it has been interpreted throughout history. For, contrary to received wisdom, very few cultures have decoded the mushroom as we do. Along the way he will ask whether magic mushrooms bring genuine transcendence, or if the experiences they occasion forever bound by culture.\r\n\r\nAndy Letcher is a freelance writer, academic lecturer and folk musician living in Oxford, UK. He lectures at Oxford Brookes University and Bath Spa University on subjects as diverse as neo-Paganism, shamanism, and theory in the Study of Religion. He is the author of the critically acclaimed Shroom: A Cultural History of the Magic Mushroom and Mad Thoughts on Mushrooms: Discourse and Power in the Study of Psychedelic Consciousness, published in the journal Anthropology of Consciousness. Known for his iconoclastic style, and with doctorates in both Ecology and the Study of Religion, he challenges us to question received wisdom about psychedelics and psychedelic history. A prolific song-writer, tunesmith and exponent of English Bagpipes, he fronts psych-folk band, Telling the Bees.

However, if decay occurs both carbon dioxide and methane is produced.  Methane is an important greenhouse gas and both contribute to climate change. ", "keywords": "Climate Change\r\nPeat Bogs\r\nMethane\r\n", "body": "Large areas of the northern hemisphere’s land mass are covered with peat.  As they grow, peatland plants absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and convert it into plant tissue.  When they die, they decay quite rapidly at first in the zone above the water table, and start to form peat.  Eventually, they become buried so that they are below the water table.  Over many thousands of years, peat deposits have built up and may exceed 5-10 m in thickness.  The total amount of carbon extracted from the atmosphere and locked up as peat equals about as much carbon (in the form of carbon dioxide and methane) as is currently present in the atmosphere.  It is commonly assumed that the peatland carbon store is fairly stable and that the decay of plant material and peat cannot take place below the water table.  However, decay does occur below the water table and produces both carbon dioxide and methane.  Methane is an important greenhouse gas – that is, it contributes to the enhanced greenhouse effect – and northern peatlands are one of the largest global sources of this gas.  We are interested in predicting how much methane enters the atmosphere and how rates of methane loss from peatlands might change over the coming decades.  To make such predictions, we need models of peatlands that simulate the production and loss of methane.  Rates of methane production and loss from peats depend on physical factors such as peat temperature but also on the composition of the plant community on the peatland, which can change over years to decades.
