[{"id": 16188, "title": "Plato on Tyranny in the Republic", "synopsis": "A look at the tyrant and the tyrannical soul in the Republic", "keywords": "philosophy, plato, platonism.", "body": "The Republic was written by Plato around 380 BC.  It portrays a lengthy dialogue between Socrates, Thrasymachus, a noted sophist and teacher, and Plato's brothers, Glaucon and Adeimantus. Several others from Athens and elsewhere are present for the dialog including Polemarchus and his father Cephalus, the hosts of the evening gathering.  The theme of the dialogue is justice. What makes a person just or unjust, and by extension, what makes a city-state just or unjust?  Socrates offers a concept of justice having to do with how a person's soul is organised. The soul is made up of three parts: desire, thumos (or the spirited part), and wisdom. If these parts of the soul are organised rightly, each part doing what it does best like a well-functioning city-state, that soul is just, and as a result that person will be as happy as they can be in their particular circumstances. But if these parts of the soul are organised in a way that allows the wrong part to govern the personality, and thus the wrong motivations to dominate, the person will necessarily make the wrong choices, their behavior will be irrational, and Socrates argues they will be profoundly unhappy. Socrates points to the life of the tyrant to illustrate his point. \r\n\r\nNo previous experience of formal philosophy is required.\r\n\r\nEntrance in free, but donations between £3-5 will be welcomed.\r\n\r\nA PDF download of the extract we will be reading is available on our website together with further details of this and other Prometheus Trust's activities: www.prometheustrust.co.uk (the PDF is on the \"London Monday Evenings\" page.)\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 2735, "added": "2018-06-07T13:15:23", "slug": "plato-on-tyranny-in-the-republic", "speakers": [{"id": 16647, "name": "Stuart  Dunbar", "slug": "stuart-dunbar"}], "topics": [{"id": 1822, "name": "philosophy", "path": "/academic/religion/religion/philosophy"}, {"id": 2388, "name": "philosophy", "path": "/arts/literature/philosophy/philosophy"}, {"id": 365, "name": "platonism", "path": "/arts/philosophy/platonism"}, {"id": 316, "name": "philosophy", "path": "/arts/art/philosophy"}], "supercategory": "academic", "venue": {"id": 3106, "name": "Cecil Sharp House", "slug": "cecil-sharp-house", "city": "London", "postcode": "NW1 7AY"}, "organizer": {"id": 2041, "name": "The Prometheus Trust", "slug": "the-prometheus-trust"}, "date": "2018-06-18", "dates": [{"id": 16748, "from_date": "2018-06-18", "to_date": "2018-06-18", "time": "19:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Donation", "ticket_info": null, "additional_info": null, "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 3106, "name": "Cecil Sharp House", "slug": "cecil-sharp-house", "city": "London", "postcode": "NW1 7AY"}, "organizer": {"id": 2041, "name": "The Prometheus Trust", "slug": "the-prometheus-trust"}}]}, {"id": 15763, "title": "Plato's Symposium and Diotima's path of love", "synopsis": "Plato's praise of love through the teachings of Diotima", "keywords": "philosophy, love, platonism, Plato", "body": "What is Love, and what part does it play in the world and in human aspiration?\r\n\r\nPlatonic philosophy takes the serious seeker of beauty and truth beyond the merely rational - as useful as reason is - and in his Phaedrus Plato calls the inspiration of Eros the \"best of all enthusiasms.\" \r\n\r\nPlato's Symposium is a series of speeches in praise of Eros made by the cultured men of classical Athens – but to this party Socrates conjures the presence of the mysterious priestess Diotima who outlines a \"ladder of love\" which, she says, we should climb.

But what is the value of thinking without action? Action is the real measure of what we are. \r\n\r\nFor thousands of years, philosophy has taught both how to think and how to live. Much more than just an intellectual pursuit, philosophy has traditionally been a way of life, a conscious putting into practice of ideas in order to produce a profound transformation.\r\n\r\n…and transform Society\r\n\r\nIt is often said that by changing ourselves, we can change the world. This is certainly true, but is individual change alone sufficient? There is also a need to change the cultural values, attitudes, systems and structures in our societies and this can only happen if we work together, with a shared vision and above all with great wisdom. \r\n\r\nBuilding a new and better society is probably the most difficult challenge of our times. It cannot be done without a deep understanding of human nature, history, of different cultures and without re-discovering the interconnectedness of everything and the sacred dimension of life. \r\n\r\nGet inspired and train yourself as a practical philosopher in order to become part of the solution.

This discussion may change your mind. Should Universities be Intellectual ‘Safe Spa", "synopsis": "Should Universities be Intellectual ‘Safe Spaces’?", "keywords": "ethics, education, free speech, students, censorship, politics, ", "body": "Universities are the intellectual heart of modern society. Students attend university to study, research and explore new ideas. In the faculty, students have access to some of society’s greatest experts and thinkers. Higher education benefits not only those individuals able to access it, but society as a whole. Higher education correlates with lower levels of unemployment and poverty, better health and higher levels of social and civic participation- including volunteering, voting, and blood donation. \r\n\r\nThe Magna Charta Universitatum, a document celebrating the principles of academic freedom and institutional autonomy, was signed by 755 universities from 80 countries on 18 September 1988 and says:\r\n\r\n“Rejecting intolerance and always open to dialogue, a university is an ideal meeting-ground for teachers capable of imparting their knowledge and well equipped to develop it by research and innovation, and for students entitled, able and willing to enrich their minds with that knowledge.”\r\n\r\nThere is, however, a growing trend among students for self-imposed censorship within university spaces. Various speakers have been ‘no platformed’ or banned by student groups, students with ‘unacceptable’ viewpoints have been censured and silenced, student events have been cancelled because of the threat of disruptive protests by those who hold different viewpoints. \r\n\r\nIn February 2015, an open letter by Beatrix Campbell condemning this type of student-imposed censorship and the restriction of free speech on campus was published in the Observer and co-signed by some of the UK’s top academics and activists including Mary Beard and Peter Tatchell. It was met with huge opposition. Many of the signatories were singled out on social media and attacked for days.\r\n\r\nIn the US, students have started insisting that not only their social spaces, but their lecture halls be “safe spaces”. Some have demanded professors provide “trigger warnings”- a notice that the content may contain writing, images or ideas which could upset or unsettle someone- on their teaching materials, including novels such as The Great Gatsby, Mrs Dalloway and Huckleberry Finn. Judging by the rise of student-led censoring and demands for ‘safe space’, UK lecturers are mere moments away from fielding similar demands from their students about the content of their courses.\r\n\r\nShould universities give in to their students and make sure that campuses are free from intellectual challenge both inside and outside the lecture hall or do the academic faculty have a duty to students to “enrich their minds with […] knowledge”?\r\n\r\nAs universities are more and more run as businesses and students are paying for their education, is it perhaps time to ask ‘is the customer always right?’\r\n\r\nJulie Bindel is a journalist, broadcaster, author and feminist campaigner. Bindel writes for the Guardian, New Statesman, Standpoint Magazine, The Spectator and the Sunday Telegraph, reporting on culture, music, food, film and sexual and gender identity. She has travelled to Nevada to spend a week in legal brothels; Florida to visit death row, the Middle East to visit Syrian refugee camps, Denver to uncover the horrors of ‘gay conversion’ therapy and many other countries all over the world to report on a range of issues.\r\n\r\nThe NUS LGBT Campaign has officially no platformed Bindel. One of the points voted on at the LGBT Conference 2011 as official NUS LGBT campaign policy was “That Julie Bindel is vile.” It passed.\r\n\r\nBrendan O’Neill is editor of Spiked, the online magazine that wants to make history as well as report it. He is also a columnist for the Big Issue and writes for the Spectator and the Telegraph. If you believe the Daily Mail, he is “one of Britain’s leading left-wing thinkers”; if you prefer to listen to the Guardian he is a “sub-Danny Dyer obnoxious intellectual wind-up merchant”. He was nominated as Columnist of the Year at the Professional Publishers Association Awards. He is, proudly, the only journalist to have written for both the Catholic Herald and Abortion Review. He doesn’t tweet.\r\n\r\nHe was invited to take part in a debate about abortion at Christ Church, Oxford in November 2014. Students protested against his participation in the debate as they said men should not be able to speak about abortion. They demanded that the event be shut down as it may have threatened the safety – “both physical and mental” – of Oxford students. O’Neill was taking the pro-choice side of the debate.\r\n\r\nPam Lowe is Senior Lecturer in Sociology at Aston University’s School of Languages and Social Sciences.

From Filippo Lippi to Raphael, Italian painters switched from egg tempera to the Netherlandish technique of painting in oils, adopted the northern approach to portraiture, emulated the depiction of light, texture and other illusionistic effects, and even copied landscape backgrounds from imported northern altarpieces. In the 15th century this influence travelled almost exclusively in one direction from north to south. However, in the 16th century this direction was effectively to reverse as the works of Michelangelo and other Italian masters caught the imagination of Netherlandish artists and their patrons (from Gossaert ultimately to Rubens). \r\n\r\nLANDSCAPE\r\n\r\nCompared with the intricately detailed and convincing panoramic landscape backgrounds in paintings by Van Eyck and others, views of landscape in early Italian Renaissance art can appear quite crude and even naïve.

Most famously for his seminal sound project Audio Arts, a tape based magazine that since 1973 recorded a sonic imprint of the artistic voice in Britain.

Focusing on the sound works produced in their own rights, such as his collaboration with Mike Archer for Orchard Gallery in 1984, and works such as Aghms & Aghs, Bearpit, and Sound Garden, that show the wide spectrum of his output, varying from edited field recordings, to productions made from the Audio Arts archive, and entirely new compositions.\r\n\r\nFor this event William Furlong presents a selection of these works in conversation with writer and curator Mel Gooding, the conversation is chaired by Associate Curator Anna Gritz.\r\n\r\nWilliam Furlong launched the innovative audio cassette-magazine Audio Arts in 1973 together with Barry Barker. From 1973 to 2006, Audio Arts published 25 volumes of 4 issues of the Audio Arts Cassettes. Since its inception it has grown to become the world’s most comprehensive and coherently focused sound archive of artists’ voices as well as sound art. The cassette-magazine has been in continuous and regular publication for thirty-five years, with over twenty-five volumes of four issues each. Interviewees include: Andy Warhol, Anish Kapoor, Joseph Beuys, Gilbert & George, Yoko Ono, R. Buckminster Fuller, Hermann Nitsch, Mario Merz, Gerhard Richter, Nam June Paik.\r\n\r\nMel Gooding is a writer, curator and lecturer on art and architecture.

And isn't it time we started getting ready to detox ?\r\n\r\nPierre Lacourt sets up temporary home in a petrol station and engages Alain, the petrol attendant, in his search for answers. Together they turn that symbolic microcosm - where money meets energy - into a stage where they re-evaluate their own beliefs and carry out experiments to illustrate the extent of our addiction and dependence. For good measure, they call in energy and environment experts to take stock and predict the different paths - some optimistic, some less so - we may have to go down in the future.\r\n\r\nThe film screening will be followed by a panel discussion with the film's director Pierre Lacourt and others to be confirmed. \r\n\r\nThe LIDF is the UK’s largest documentary festival.

These events have occurred simultaneous to a devastating economic crisis and with the ongoing femicide that activists have fought for almost 20 years. This paper asks the question: How can a feminist and Marxist geographer  contribute to an analysis of what is happening in Ciudad Juarez? To address it, I create a dialogue among activists in northern Mexico and post-structuralist feminist and Marxist positions regarding the meaning of public fear in this city for the city's residents, for Mexico's democracy and for the making of public knowledge about the Mexico-US border. \r\n\r\nMelissa Wright is Associate Professor of Women's Studies at Penn State University. She studies the dynamics linking political, cultural and economic processes. Her research is based primarily in Mexico and along the Mexico-U.S. border. She has also conducted fieldwork in southern China and in Hong Kong. Her research has focused on the emergence of an international social movement that protests violence against women along the Mexico-U.S. border. Another project has examined the meaning of citizenship in a transnational context.

Despite the global recession the PV industry has continued  to grow, mostly driven by market incentive schemes such as the Feed-in Tariff (FiT).  However, alongside other micro-generation technologies, PV looks expensive with competitive electricity generation depending on location as well as the cost of the system.  Higher volume manufacture has helped to reduce the price of  PV modules and installation but long term cost reduction lies in the materials used to manufacture PV modules.  This talk will explore the different materials technologies that are used in PV modules and the long term potential for increased conversion efficiency and  reduced cost. Crystalline silicon continues to dominate the market but new thin film PV products are now being produced on a much larger scale than before and will result in both a larger share of the market and lower cost PV products.  Materials research to address these issues will be outlined.  This has underlined the importance of new challenges in achieving large scale production, higher solar conversion efficiency and materials sustainability.  The prospect of  lower cost PV modules based on the dye sensitised solar cells (DSC) and polymers is attracting an increased investment in both R&D and pilot production.  The next few years will see a new range of PV products coming onto the market based on these materials.

(Chadwick, 1992; p. xiv))\r\n\r\nTrue delusions are conventionally regarded as being “psychologically un-understandable” (Jaspers, 1913). This view will be challenged on three fronts. Firstly, work into schizotypy has suggested that symptoms of schizophrenia are at the extreme end of a continuum, which ranges from healthy functioning, through eccentricity, to florid psychosis. It will be demonstrated that delusions lie on a continuum with normal beliefs, and that their form may be more important diagnostically than their content. Secondly, several psychological conceptualisations of delusions will be presented, most of which agree that delusions share many characteristics with normal beliefs. Key models emphasise the importance of unusual experiences in driving delusional explanations, the role of appraisals in determining delusional outcome, as well as the presence of reasoning biases such as a “jump-to-conclusions” reasoning style. Experimental support for these models will be presented, in healthy delusion-prone people, undiagnosed individuals with anomalous experiences, and actively deluded patients. Lastly, the therapeutic implications of this work will be discussed in the context of recent developments for cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) for psychosis.\r\n\r\nDr Emmanuelle Peters is a Senior Lecturer in Clinical Psychology at the Institute of Psychiatry, King’s College London.

In consequence, many structuralist phonologists came to regard phonemes as a “convenient fiction”, useful for e.g. alphabetic notation or orthographic purposes, but without a clearly demonstrable, principled basis. In the UK, the London School of phonologists associated with J. R. Firth came to reject phonemic theory completely, and developed an alternative conception of phonological structure that came to dominate phonological thought in Britain for decades (and still attracts considerable interest today). The displacement of the nominalist (“convenient fiction”) view of phonology by generative phonologists in the 1950’s and 60’s led initially to the rejection of the phonemic level of representation (Halle 1959), although the phoneme was later somewhat rehabilitated, following Schane (1971).\r\n\r\nDespite these problems, elementary textbooks and courses in linguistics have continue to present the phoneme construct as an established truth, and the various well-studied problems and objections of earlier years are little-studied. In this talk, I shall revisit a selection of classic studies and some more recent work on the problems of the phoneme, and review some proposals that have been advanced to address these problems. My presentation is addressed in particular to those who work on language (e.g. linguists, psychologists, educationalists, speech technologists) who are not normally particularly exercised by matters of phonological theory.\r\n\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": null, "added": "2006-11-10T14:27:50", "slug": "problems-with-phonemes", "speakers": [{"id": 4533, "name": "Dr John Coleman", "slug": "dr-john-coleman"}], "topics": [{"id": 4, "name": "phonology", "path": "/academic/arts/linguistics/phonology"}, {"id": 3, "name": "linguistics", "path": "/academic/arts/linguistics"}, {"id": 88, "name": "linguistics", "path": "/academic/linguistics"}, {"id": 1, "name": "academic", "path": "/academic"}, {"id": 6, "name": "arts", "path": "/arts"}, {"id": 377, "name": "language", "path": "/academic/language"}, {"id": 447, "name": "languages", "path": "/academic/languages"}, {"id": 740, "name": "languages", "path": "/academic/linguistics/languages"}, {"id": 287, "name": "language", "path": "/arts/language"}], "supercategory": "academic", "venue": {"id": 1194, "name": "LG17, The Faculty of Law", "slug": "lg17-the-faculty-of-law", "city": "Cambridge", "postcode": "CB3 9DZ"}, "organizer": {"id": 1122, "name": "Cambridge University Linguistic Society, University of Cambridge", "slug": "cambridge-university-linguistic-society-university-of-cambridge"}, "date": "2006-11-16", "dates": [{"id": 3741, "from_date": "2006-11-16", "to_date": "2006-11-16", "time": "17:00:00", "ticket_cost": "Membership in the Linguistic Society is £6 a year or £5 for students.", "ticket_info": null, "additional_info": "Cambridge University Linguistic Society aims to bring together people with an interest in language.

How should you fit the line if you want to treat each\r\nvariable on the same basis? Least squares regression is inappropriate here\r\nsince it's purpose is the prediction of one of the variables; furthermore\r\nit provides a different slope estimate if the variables are switched. I\r\nshall present a method which gives a unique slope and line, and which is\r\ninvariant to changes in units of measurement. This neutral fitting method\r\nis also of use if one is estimating scientific law-like relationships. The\r\nextension to multiple variables will also be discussed.\r\n\r\nBy way of illustration I apply the method to the estimation of beta in\r\nfinance. An investment that has a beta exceeding unity is classified as\r\n'aggressive', whereas a value below unity classifies it as 'defensive'. \r\nMore generally, beta values are used to rank investments for risk\r\npurposes. We use real data to illustrate the changes in risk rankings that\r\nare implied by our estimator. We find that formerly defensive single\r\nstocks generally need to be re- classified as aggressive.\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": null, "added": "2004-05-07T11:30:48", "slug": "neutral-data-fitting-by-dr-chris-tofallis-university-of-hertfordshire", "speakers": [{"id": 663, "name": "Dr Chris Tofallis", "slug": "dr-chris-tofallis"}], "topics": [{"id": 165, "name": "data", "path": "/science/data"}], "supercategory": "science", "venue": {"id": 235, "name": "Middlesex University Business School", "slug": "middlesex-university-business-school", "city": "London", "postcode": "NW4 4BT"}, "organizer": {"id": 235, "name": "Middlesex University Business School", "slug": "middlesex-university-business-school"}, "date": "2004-05-19", "dates": [{"id": 540, "from_date": "2004-05-19", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "16:30:00", "ticket_cost": "None", "ticket_info": "No purchase necessary, however, please email to book a place:\r\nM.Lane@mdx.ac.uk", "additional_info": "BRIEF BIOGRAPHY\r\nDr. Christopher Tofallis is a senior lecturer in the Department of\r\nStatistics, Economics, Accounting and Management Systems at the\r\nUniversity of Hertfordshire Business School.
