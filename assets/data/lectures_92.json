Devoted working partners and pioneering collaborators, they established the acclaimed (and notorious) Covent Garden anatomy school in London’s West End, published ground-breaking research and revolutionised British medicine. \r\nThen they fell out, catastrophically and permanently.\r\nThis special event tells the story of these two remarkable siblings, their tumultuous relationship and the sometimes shocking realities of 18th century anatomical study. All in an evening marking three centuries since the birth of William Hunter, legendary anatomist, prominent physician and pioneering man-midwife. \r\nJoining forces to mount this unique tribute are the Hunterian Museum at the Royal College of Surgeons, and the Royal College of Physicians. During the course of the event a lecture and tours will recount the two men’s intriguing lives, explore their astonishing achievements and highlight their magnificent legacies: including the museums in Glasgow and London that bear their names and house their collections. \r\n\r\nIn her talk, award-winning author of The Knife-Man Wendy Moore will reveal William and John's stormy personal bond as both brothers and professional rivals in a bloody and ruthless medical world, where surgeons and physicians rarely saw eye to eye.\r\n\r\nExclusive new tours of the Royal College of Physicians' museum collection will further illuminate the often complex and strained connections between the professions, delving into the frequently gory and amoral environment of eighteenth century medicine and anatomy. Items featured include centuries old ‘anatomical plates’ made from human remains, a 17th century surgical toolkit, bloodletting equipment and historical portraits from the college’s collection. \r\nA rare opportunity to plunge into the blood-soaked world of Georgian anatomists and medics, this evening may not be for the faint hearted, but will fascinate anyone with an interest in the history of medicine, science, society, and our understanding of the human body. \r\nProgramme:\r\n6.00pm: Drinks reception\r\n6.15pm: Tour 1\r\n7.00pm: Talk by author Wendy Moore\r\n8.15pm: Tour 2\r\n9.00pm: Close\r\n\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 180, "image_id": 2584, "added": "2018-11-07T14:02:04", "slug": "77bc4bb02f09d651", "speakers": [{"id": 7978, "name": "Wendy Moore", "slug": "wendy-moore"}], "topics": [{"id": 1397, "name": "medicine", "path": "/academic/science/philosophy/engineering/biology/medicine"}, {"id": 170, "name": "newtopic", "path": "/science/chemistry/biochemistry/catalysis/newtopic"}, {"id": 2692, "name": "history", "path": "/arts/finearts/film/film/history"}, {"id": 106, "name": "wwi", "path": "/arts/books/history/military/wwi"}], "supercategory": "academic", "venue": {"id": 2684, "name": "Royal College of Physicians", "slug": "royal-college-of-physicians", "city": "London", "postcode": "NW1 4LE"}, "organizer": {"id": 2684, "name": "Royal College of Physicians", "slug": "royal-college-of-physicians"}, "date": "2018-10-16", "dates": [{"id": 16868, "from_date": "2018-10-16", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "18:00:00", "ticket_cost": "£8 (students and concessions £5) including a free drink", "ticket_info": "https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/blood-brothers-william-hunter-at-300-tickets-49279996797", "additional_info": "Event Phone Number:\r\n020 3075 1543\r\nEvent Email Address:\r\nhistory@rcplondon.ac.uk \r\n\r\n", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 2684, "name": "Royal College of Physicians", "slug": "royal-college-of-physicians", "city": "London", "postcode": "NW1 4LE"}, "organizer": {"id": 2684, "name": "Royal College of Physicians", "slug": "royal-college-of-physicians"}}]}, {"id": 16314, "title": "Crossing Borders 2018: 20 November 7-8:30pm -

Contemporary writers have Gothicised the fairy tale for a new generation, questioning the value of old narratives in a changed world.\r\n\r\nThis talk will examine one of Carter’s less-researched Gothic fairy tales, “Ashputtle, or The Mother’s Ghost” (1987), and the matrophobic Gothic elements it draws out of the Cinderella tale’s obscure older versions. Here the Gothic becomes a critical tool with which the text can interrogate the sociopolitical forces that have influenced the endurance or disappearance of different elements in the Cinderella tale tradition.\r\n\r\nCarter’s re-Gothicisation of the Cinderella tale creates a feminist text interconnected with its political contexts; millennial Gothic fairy tales, however, show a clear move away from political agency into individualism, as seen in Ali Shaw’s Gothic retelling of Cinderella, The Girl with Glass Feet (2009). The monstrous feminine here is re-sublimated into silence, stillness and sexualised beauty, turning the female Gothic against the heroine in an example of a wider retreat from late-twentieth-century feminism.\r\n\r\nBIO:\r\nDr Carina Hart is a Lecturer in English Literature at Middlesex University, having previously taught at the University of Nottingham Malaysia Campus, Nottingham Trent University and the University of East Anglia, where she completed her PhD.

Unless we correct this then democracy will exist but in name only.\r\n\r\nWe often look on Multinational corporations as being agents that lobby government as do other organisations in civil society. However in reality they belong on the inside. They are part of the nexus of power that creates policy. They face no significant resistance, from either government or opposition, as their interests have now been woven into the fabric of all three main political parties in Britain.\r\n\r\nAnd because they are intrinsic to all main political parties their influence on democracy is not discussed in Parliament. But that is what we wish to discuss at this meeting.\r\n\r\nDoes a state-corporate nexus of power bypass democracy and make a mockery of the voting process as corporations buy political favours and eat into our public services without redress?\r\n\r\nIf so then how can we remedy this and bring democracy back to the people rather than see it in the hands of a self-perpetuating power elite?\r\n\r\nThis will be the basis of this discussion with ample time for audience questions and comments as part of the evening. Helping us lead this discussion will be:\r\n\r\nNick Dearden is Director of Global Justice Now. Nick started his career at War on Want where he became a senior campaigner. He went on to be corporates campaign manager at Amnesty International UK. As director of the Jubilee Debt Campaign, he built strong relationships with campaigners in the global south. He helped win a new law to stop Vulture Funds from using UK courts to squeeze huge debt payments out of poor countries.\r\n\r\nSimon Franks co-founded film rental service LOVEFiLM and film distribution company Redbus. Former city trader Franks started Redbus from his spare bedroom, which grew to become one of the largest film distributors in Europe, with turnover of $50m, before co-founding one of the biggest names in film rental LOVEFiLM in 2003. Co-founder of two hugely successful businesses, Simon has been a prominent figure in UK enterprise since the 1990s. He has told backers he wants to emulate Emmanuel Marcon’s En Marche!

In particular, Jim will discuss how the artist at times needs to kidnap their audience and that art can help pose necessary and difficult questions that we otherwise shy away from.\r\n\r\nFor Holly Tingley, art is more than a means of expression, it’s a way of understanding her subject. An interest in psychology has played a substantial role in her development as an artist and she is especially interested in trying to express her experience as an identical twin. A shared appearance, sometimes inferred as a shared identity has made Holly very conscious of individuality and others perceptions of it. She states, “Increased births and the lingering threat of human cloning, make us question further who we are physically, as well as psychologically. I see this as similar to how continuous reproduction of our own image, through the immediacy of digital photography, plays an important role in how we see ourselves. My work is an ongoing investigation of this state of constant individual redefinition.” Issues related to the fields of human genetics, concepts of otherness, the uncanny and the copy, also influence the nature of Holly’s work.\r\n\r\nLawrence Mathias works mainly as a visual artist, but his work crosses over into film, music, poetry and collaborations.

Moreover, Darwin is hailed as the immortal great thinker on the subject of evolution, because he alone is recognised as first to take his own discovery of the theory of natural selection forward, with many confirmatory evidences, convincing others of its veracity and importance.\r\nIn this talk, Mike Sutton will challenge this view with new evidence that proves that, pre-1858, Matthew’s book was read by at least seven naturalists. Three of the seven were at the epicentre of influence on Darwin’s and Wallace’s researches and two of those three were personal associates and correspondents of Darwin and Wallace.

Examples include ballast being picked up off the track bed by aerodynamic forces, and, in extreme cases, sonic booms occurring at the exit of long tunnels.  \r\n\r\nThis presentation will give an overview of the current concerns in this field and describe the work being carried out by the Aerodynamics team at the Birmingham Centre for Railway Research and Education, using computational techniques, physical models and on-track measurements.\r\n\r\nThis lecture will be given by Professor Chris Baker, Professor of Environmental Fluid Mechanics at the University of Birmingham.\r\n\r\nFor more information and to register, please visit our website www.aerosociety.com/events", "additional_info": null, "duration": 60, "image_id": null, "added": "2014-02-25T16:14:32", "slug": "43b0c9741ac854d7", "speakers": [{"id": 14518, "name": "Professor Chris Baker", "slug": "professor-chris-baker"}], "topics": [{"id": 434, "name": "aviation", "path": "/science/engineering/aviation"}, {"id": 3082, "name": "aviation", "path": "/society/transport/aviation"}, {"id": 2212, "name": "railways", "path": "/society/transport/railways"}, {"id": 175, "name": "energy", "path": "/science/energy"}, {"id": 434, "name": "aviation", "path": "/science/engineering/aviation"}, {"id": 3639, "name": "trains", "path": "/science/engineering/trains"}], "supercategory": "science", "venue": {"id": 1141, "name": "Royal Aeronautical Society", "slug": "royal-aeronautical-society", "city": "London", "postcode": "W1J 7BQ"}, "organizer": {"id": 1141, "name": "Royal Aeronautical Society", "slug": "royal-aeronautical-society"}, "date": "2014-04-28", "dates": [{"id": 13999, "from_date": "2014-04-28", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "18:00:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": null, "additional_info": "All RAeS lectures are free to attend and open to both members and non-members of the Society.

Its central claim is that beliefs compatible with biblically inspired creationism are in fact scientifically superior to mainstream views on evolution and an old earth. Its arguments for supernatural intervention range from the ludicrous to the highly sophisticated; from “Flood geology” to the origin of biological information; from Jehovah’s Witnesses pamphlets to seemingly scholarly works invoking cellular complexity or the so-called Cambrian Explosion. The creationists themselves are not necessarily stupid, nor ill-informed, nor (in other matters) deluded. In all cases, their deep motivation is the wish to preserve the supernatural role of God the Creator, and a particular view of the man-God relationship.\r\nThere are several interlocking organisations active in the UK to promote creationism. These include Glasgow’s own Centre for Intelligent Design (closely linked to the Seattle-based Discovery Institute and its notorious Wedge Strategy), Truth in Science, and The World Around Us/The Genesis Agendum, who between them have links to Brethren churches, the Christian Schools Trust, Answers in Genesis, and Creation Ministries International.\r\nPaul will be discussing the attempts by such organizations to infiltrate the educational system, the inadequacies of official attempts to prevent this, and possible countermeasures.

When they married Porchey,  ( who was a life long flirt and sex pest  ) the two women were vulnerable and penniless. Their marital capitulation into the chore of being Porchey’s bed mate was nothing to do with his looks or magnetic sex appeal or of being wonderfully romanced, it was instead all down to acquiring a husband who was better off than they were financially. Socially both women made an impact on many men, they were no angels.  Whilst Porchey made reasonable husband material on grounds of title, money and property neither relationship was a love match and  both women were duped by their family and friends into risking the holy state of matrimony. The marriages proved hell holes for the women.  Porchey was an egotist and regularly unfaithful and cruel. Catherine turned to alcohol and suffered a series of nervous breakdowns. She tried to kill herself.   Tilly  escaped to America after just ten weeks as Highclere’s chatelaine, whilst Porchey lined up his next Countess.   This is the story of how these two women caught in the trap of being Porchey’s wife overcame the abuses, and their own personal tragedies and health scares, to find  inner happiness. Catherine eventually found peace with a man who loved her. Tilly (always the more public and charismatic of Porchey’s wives) became an amateur artist, whilst continuing to ply her trade as one of the iconic symbols of the 20th Century.  \r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 1992, "added": "2013-10-28T19:37:03", "slug": "catherine-wendell-and-tilly-losch", "speakers": [{"id": 13766, "name": "Mr William  Cross", "slug": "mr-william-cross"}], "topics": [], "supercategory": "academic", "venue": {"id": 2906, "name": "Newport Hard of Hearing Club", "slug": "newport-hard-of-hearing-club", "city": "Newport", "postcode": "NP20 1UH"}, "organizer": {"id": 2861, "name": "William Cross, FSA Scot", "slug": "william-cross-fsa-scot"}, "date": "2013-11-20", "dates": [{"id": 13640, "from_date": "2013-11-20", "to_date": "2013-11-20", "time": "14:00:00", "ticket_cost": "Membership £2 per meeting", "ticket_info": "Pay on the day £2 for to cover your tea and biscuit", "additional_info": "An illustrated talk from William Cross, FSA\r\nScot on his new book", "members_only": "Yes", "members_info": "Appy to the Secretary Newport Hard of Hearing Club c/o Newport Centre", "venue": {"id": 2906, "name": "Newport Hard of Hearing Club", "slug": "newport-hard-of-hearing-club", "city": "Newport", "postcode": "NP20 1UH"}, "organizer": {"id": 2861, "name": "William Cross, FSA Scot", "slug": "william-cross-fsa-scot"}}]}, {"id": 13061, "title": "Coming from one of Pakistan's political dynasties, the country has always been at the heart of Fatim", "synopsis": "Coming from one of Pakistan's political dynasties, the country has always been at the heart of Fatima Bhutto's writing.

He is the organisation’s chief political adviser, strategist and spokesperson and takes Amnesty International’s campaigns to the highest level of government, the United Nations and business. \r\n\r\nSince joining Amnesty International, Salil Shetty has been vocal in supporting the people’s uprising for human rights in the Middle East and North Africa. In December 2010, he led Amnesty International's show of solidarity in Oslo for the imprisoned Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Liu Xiaobo calling on the Chinese authorities to improve their human rights record. In September 2010, he represented Amnesty International at the United Nations General Assembly.  \r\n\r\nSalil Shetty has ambitious plans to strengthen Amnesty International's work in the Global South. He has travelled extensively for Amnesty International since joining the organisation, meeting many grassroots activists. \r\n\r\nSalil Shetty first became involved in campaigning for human rights when growing up in Bangalore, India. With his mother active in women’s groups and his father with the Dalit movement, his home became a hub for local and national activists. Since his student days, when a state of emergency was declared in 1976, and as the President of his college student’s union, Salil Shetty has been actively campaigning against the curtailment of human rights. \r\n\r\nPrior to joining Amnesty International, Salil Shetty was Director of the United Nations Millennium Campaign from 2003 to 2010.  He played a pivotal role in building the global advocacy campaign for the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals - eight goals to fight poverty, illiteracy and disease.

This lecture seeks to challenge the modern idea that arts, science and religion naturally exist exclusively of one other; Mr Lines will attempt to evoke the rich, inter-disciplinary intellectual culture of the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nDarwin laid the foundations for the theory of evolution, transforming the way we think about the natural world; Wallace was a fellow scientist who came up with the idea of natural selection, almost simultaneously; and Tennyson, not a scientist but a great poet, somehow articulated the theory of natural selection in print, some nine years before Darwin. Richard Lines will speak about how different types of imagination and human enquiry contributed to a greater ‘scientific’ understanding of our world.\r\n\r\nLeading on from this, Mr. Lines will also explore how scientific discovery impacted upon the spiritual beliefs of these great Victorians. Whilst Darwin apparently abandoned his religious faith, both Wallace and Tennyson combined a passionate interest in contemporary science with an unorthodox Christian belief, heavily informed by the writings of Swedish seer Emanuel Swedenborg – himself a scientist and radical theologian and at once a rationalist and a mystic.\r\n\r\nRefreshments will be provided from 6pm.\r\nEverybody is welcome.\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 1197, "added": "2009-07-06T11:17:40", "slug": "fb2a851320ea7f01", "speakers": [{"id": 6872, "name": "Mr Richard Lines", "slug": "mr-richard-lines"}], "topics": [{"id": 1398, "name": "evolution", "path": "/academic/science/philosophy/engineering/biology/medicine/evolut"}, {"id": 1399, "name": "evolution", "path": "/academic/science/philosophy/engineering/biology/medicine/evolut"}, {"id": 604, "name": "poetry", "path": "/arts/language/translation/fromfrench/poetry"}, {"id": 106, "name": "wwi", "path": "/arts/books/history/military/wwi"}, {"id": 1316, "name": "spiritualism", "path": "/religion/paranormal/spiritualism"}, {"id": 1097, "name": "faithandscience", "path": "/religion/christianity/faithandscience"}, {"id": 907, "name": "mysticism", "path": "/religion/mysticism/mysticism"}, {"id": 1526, "name": "mystical", "path": "/religion/faith/mystical"}, {"id": 1721, "name": "religion", "path": "/religion/religion/religion"}, {"id": 1523, "name": "mystical", "path": "/arts/poetry/mystical"}, {"id": 416, "name": "classics", "path": "/arts/poetry/classics"}, {"id": 501, "name": "19thcentury", "path": "/arts/history/19thcentury"}, {"id": 269, "name": "victorian", "path": "/arts/history/victorian"}, {"id": 314, "name": "culture", "path": "/arts/philosophy/culture"}, {"id": 365, "name": "platonism", "path": "/arts/philosophy/platonism"}, {"id": 364, "name": "rationalism", "path": "/arts/philosophy/rationalism"}], "supercategory": "academic", "venue": {"id": 1879, "name": "The Swedenborg Society", "slug": "the-swedenborg-society", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC1A 2TH"}, "organizer": {"id": 1879, "name": "The Swedenborg Society", "slug": "the-swedenborg-society"}, "date": "2009-07-09", "dates": [{"id": 7159, "from_date": "2009-07-09", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "18:30:00", "ticket_cost": "FREE", "ticket_info": null, "additional_info": "Any questions welcomed.\r\n\r\nPhone (020) 7405 7986 for details.", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 1879, "name": "The Swedenborg Society", "slug": "the-swedenborg-society", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC1A 2TH"}, "organizer": {"id": 1879, "name": "The Swedenborg Society", "slug": "the-swedenborg-society"}}]}, {"id": 6707, "title": "Things Fall Apart", "synopsis": "Read by Rounke Williams\r\n\r\n", "keywords": "Fabrica, Brighton Festival 2009, Art, Narrative, Readings, Anish Kapoor, Blood Relations, Performance,Chinua Achebe, Rounke Williams, ", "body": "Chinua Achebe’s first and most famous novel, Things Fall Apart reclaims African culture from the stereotyped images of savagery that inhabit colonial European literature.

The fact that her mother was from the country of the colonisers, provided extra depth to her reading of these classics.  Rounke came to the UK in 1978 to finish her formal education.  From 2000, she facilitated the development of resources for Brighton and Hove local authority on cultural diversity for school children.

She pioneered the legal claim for sexual harassment and, with Andrea Dworkin, created ordinances recognizing pornography as a civil rights violation. The Supreme Court of Canada largely accepted her approaches to equality, pornography, and hate speech. Her scholarly books include Sex Equality (2001, 2007), Toward a Feminist Theory of the State (1989), Only Words (1993), Women's Lives, Men's Laws (2005), and Are Women Human? (2006). She is published in journals, the popular press, and many languages. Representing Bosnian women survivors of Serbian genocidal sexual atrocities, she won with co-counsel a damage award of $745 million in August 2000 in Kadic v. Karadzic, which first recognized rape as an act of genocide. She works with Equality Now, an NGO promoting international sex equality rights for women. Professor MacKinnon holds a B.A. from Smith College, a J.D. from Yale Law School, and a Ph.D. in political science from Yale. She has taught at Yale, Chicago, Harvard, Osgoode Hall, Stanford, Basel (Switzerland), and Columbia, spent a year at the Wissenschaftskolleg zu Berlin and at the Institute for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences, and practices and consults nationally and internationally.

The impact of climate change on its complex series of habitats may be relatively swift and profound.  The work currently being carried out to mitigate and adapt to climate change will be outlined and its effectiveness and sufficiency discussed.\r\nThe role of the countryside manager to pioneer issues and influence regional and national decision makers is a 'growth industry' particularly with regard to planning frameworks, transportation plans and the management of projects at a landscape scale.\r\nAndy Barnard’s interest in countryside management started in 1976 when, as an eighteen year old, he moved to the Peak District National Park.  He joined the Park Ranger Service as a volunteer and then moved to part time and seasonal work.  He left the Peak Park Ranger Service in 1983 to join the National Trust as the Area Warden for Edale.  Here he had the privilege to manage the high moors of the Kinder Scout plateau as well as the Winnats Pass, Mam Tor and their associated hill farms.\r\nAndy joined the City of London Corporation in 1996 as Superintendent of Burnham Beeches NNR.  This role has given him the opportunity to manage one the Britain's best loved landscapes as well as expand his experience to include planning, sustainable building and transportation issues in the peri-urban environment, - the urban-rural transition zone.\r\nHe gained an MSc in Countryside Management from Manchester Metropolitan University (1996) and a Post Graduate Diploma in Business Administration at Reading University (2000).  He is a member of the City of London's Climate Change and Sustainability Working Parties and Chairman of the Biodiversity Working Group.  Hobbies include photography, hill walking and working his sheepdogs.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.\t‘River restoration London: taking action to address climate change impacts on biodiversity’\r\n\r\nSince 1999 approximately 1km of concrete river channel each year has been restored in London.  A London wide target has now been agreed to restore 15km of river by 2015 and 25km by 2020.  The current programme provides a practical example of how to respond to climate change.  The lecture provides background on the development of the programme and discusses how the programme contributes to establishment of ecological resilience and develops the capacity for systems to adapt.  The need to develop networks will be examined and the measures required to deliver a network will be discussed.\r\nDave Webb is a Conservation Technical Specialist for the Environment Agency.  Having been involved in river restoration in London since the early 1990’s, Dave was responsible for the production of the South London River Restoration Strategy and has been directly involved in numerous restoration projects.  Dave worked on secondment to the Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), providing scientific advice to policy divisions on a range of biodiversity issues, with particular emphasis on climate change, representing Defra on the MONARCH project steering group.  More recently, Dave provided advice on the development environmental infra-structure policies in both the South East Plan and the Further Alterations to the London Plan.  He is currently the Chair of the Rivers and Streams Habitat Action Plan, and is working on the development of a London Wide River Restoration Action Plan, as well as continuing to provide practical advice on restoration schemes in London and the South East.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.\t‘Landscape scale projects and ecological networks, can they form the basis for a nature conservation strategy against the backdrop of climate change?’\r\n\r\nWhilst there is a strong scientific consensus that climate change is happening and even broad agreement on what the effects might be on a national to international scale, the effects at a regional or local scale are far more difficult to predict.  A nature conservation strategy is therefore needed that might allow for greatest environmental adaptability even though the magnitude, nature or even the direction of any local change may not be known.  Nature is robust and has responded to changes in the past (although it is arguable whether climate change was as rapid as that expected now), but the current fragmentary nature of habitats and ecosystems probably hinders wildlife movement and habitat adaptation.  Thus, as climate changes, the inability of habitats to adapt may result in ecosystem degradation, resulting in significant species loss and possible breakdown in ecosystem services. Whilst recognizing that the science may be uncertain, it is suggested that an ecological network approach may offer the best insurance policy for our wildlife.  This case study will look at ideas for an ecological network throughout Sussex and the South East and outline some work being done to develop larger more ecologically viable units within the area.\r\nDr Tony Whitbread is the Chief Executive of the Sussex Wildlife Trust.  He started his career in nature conservation with the then Nature Conservancy Council initially working as a biological surveyor and then compiling Ancient Woodland Inventories for counties around England and Wales.  Still in the NCC he later carried out National Vegetation Classification woodland surveys, in the process producing a summary of the woodland chapter, and assisted the NCC with survey and monitoring work following the 1987 storm.  He then moved to the Royal Society for Nature Conservation to co-ordinate the response of the Wildlife Trusts to the storm and produced documents outlining some of the positive effects of natural disturbance.  He joined the Sussex Wildlife Trust as Head of Conservation in 1991 and became Chief Executive in April 2006.  He has an ongoing interest in woodland ecology including woodland dynamics, natural processes etc, and has represented the Wildlife Trusts on several woodland forums.\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 120, "image_id": null, "added": "2007-08-24T09:52:03", "slug": "british-wildlife-and-climate-change-adaptation-and-mitigation-measures-on-specific-sites", "speakers": [{"id": 5805, "name": "Andy Barnard", "slug": "andy-barnard"}, {"id": 5806, "name": "Dave Webb", "slug": "dave-webb"}, {"id": 5807, "name": "Dr Tony Whitbread", "slug": "dr-tony-whitbread"}], "topics": [{"id": 225, "name": "environment", "path": "/science/environment"}, {"id": 1105, "name": "ecology", "path": "/science/ecology"}, {"id": 70, "name": "biology", "path": "/science/biology"}, {"id": 868, "name": "climate", "path": "/science/climatechange/climate"}, {"id": 468, "name": "naturalhistory", "path": "/science/naturalhistory"}, {"id": 467, "name": "zoology", "path": "/science/zoology"}], "supercategory": "science", "venue": {"id": 1433, "name": "at a Birkbeck lecture theatre/University of London", "slug": "at-a-birkbeck-lecture-theatreuniversity-of-london", "city": "London", "postcode": "W C1E"}, "organizer": {"id": 1069, "name": "Ecology and Conservation Studies Society", "slug": "ecology-and-conservation-studies-society"}, "date": "2007-11-16", "dates": [{"id": 4788, "from_date": "2007-11-16", "to_date": "2007-11-16", "time": "18:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": "For free tickets and venue details, contact tel:  020 7679 1069, or e-mail:   environment@fce.bbk.ac.uk", "additional_info": "For queries on lecture content, contact tel:  020 7485 7903, or e-mail:   jeremy.wright@walkern.org.uk", "members_only": "No", "members_info": "Details of the Society and application forms will be available at the door, and are on our website http://www.bbk.ac.uk/ce/environment/ecssociety/index.shtml", "venue": {"id": 1433, "name": "at a Birkbeck lecture theatre/University of London", "slug": "at-a-birkbeck-lecture-theatreuniversity-of-london", "city": "London", "postcode": "W C1E"}, "organizer": {"id": 1069, "name": "Ecology and Conservation Studies Society", "slug": "ecology-and-conservation-studies-society"}}]}, {"id": 4340, "title": "What's the greatest innovation", "synopsis": "This online survey and public event aim to highlight some of the many gains of human ingenuity, and to putthe current discussion of innovation into a historical context. \r\n", "keywords": "innovation, science, technology, medicine, Nobel-laureates, spiked, pfizer", "body": "’What’s the Greatest Innovation?’ is a survey of key thinkers in science, technology and medicine, conducted by spiked in collaboration with the research-based pharmaceutical company Pfizer.

Speaking for the affirmative will be Sony Kapoor, international finance and development expert, and Senior Advisor to Christian Aid UK and the Stamp Out Poverty Campaign.  This debate is part of the ongoing JustShare Tuesday Lunchtime Debates series. See http://www.stmarylebow.co.uk/debate.htm\r\n\r\nThe stamp duty proposed by Stamp Out Poverty would apply to all trades in sterling, wherever in the world they occur.  It can be implemented unilaterally by the UK government and collected at settlement using existing systems such as CLS.  Tax enforcement is feasible, even where the trades occur outside the UK jurisdiction, because such systems are linked to the Bank of England (and where they are not, such linkage can be made mandatory through enhanced regulatory requirements, or the central bank can use it’s functional power to ensure this happens).  Hence there would be no incentive for institutions to re-locate away from the UK, as doing so would not enable the duty to be avoided.\r\n\r\nResearch by academics and market experts for the Stamp Out Poverty campaign shows that the low rate proposed would not disrupt the market.  The incidence would be spread across a large number of banks and their corporate customers, and the revenue raised would be an insignificant burden on any individual trading party.  Compliance costs are also likely to be low and marginal, as most of the market is electronic and much of the necessary transactional reporting information is already being captured.  Avoiding the duty using derivatives or other methods is highly infeasible, and is likely to cost more than paying it.\r\n\r\nCurrency trading amounts to $475,000 billion per year, and is the largest market in the world.  While many other transactions have stamp duties, currency trading is exempt.  Each day 30,000 children die needlessly, and there is an urgent need for innovative financing mechanism to fund new investment in poverty eradication, and to achieve the Millennium Development Goals.  Taxing the currency trade to finance development is an idea whose time has come.", "additional_info": null, "duration": 60, "image_id": 435, "added": "2005-08-29T12:24:50", "slug": "tax-currency-transactions-a-way-to-finance-development", "speakers": [{"id": 2694, "name": "Mr Sony Kapoor", "slug": "mr-sony-kapoor"}, {"id": 2695, "name": "Mr Jim O'Neill", "slug": "mr-jim-oneill"}], "topics": [{"id": 746, "name": "internationaldevelopment", "path": "/academic/economics/internationaldevelopment"}, {"id": 747, "name": "finance", "path": "/business/finance"}, {"id": 750, "name": "internationaldevelopment", "path": "/politics/internationaldevelopment"}, {"id": 748, "name": "povertyanddevelopment", "path": "/politics/africa/povertyanddevelopment"}, {"id": 749, "name": "corporateresponsibility", "path": "/business/ethics/corporateresponsibility"}], "supercategory": "academic", "venue": {"id": 743, "name": "St Mary le Bow Church", "slug": "st-mary-le-bow-church", "city": "London", "postcode": "EC2V 6AU"}, "organizer": {"id": 717, "name": "Stamp Out Poverty", "slug": "stamp-out-poverty"}, "date": "2005-09-06", "dates": [{"id": 2183, "from_date": "2005-09-06", "to_date": "2005-09-06", "time": "13:00:00", "ticket_cost": "Free admission", "ticket_info": null, "additional_info": "Light refreshments will be provided.", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 743, "name": "St Mary le Bow Church", "slug": "st-mary-le-bow-church", "city": "London", "postcode": "EC2V 6AU"}, "organizer": {"id": 717, "name": "Stamp Out Poverty", "slug": "stamp-out-poverty"}}]}, {"id": 2180, "title": "Punk Science: The Albert Einstein Experience debuts at the Edinburgh Fringe", "synopsis": "Punk Science, the resident team of stand up comics at the Dana Centre, are making their debut appearance at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe.

A show that explains everything that Einstein brought to a venue near you.\r\n\r\n“He was so ahead of his time, that when he did win the Nobel Prize in 1921, it was for his work on The Photoelectric Effect, suggesting that even sixteen years later, none of the Nobel Prize judges had worked out quite what the Special Theory of Relativity was. \r\n\r\n“The point is, that this is really, REALLY hardcore physics. The worst kind. Not the cool sort that lets you make a robot. Just the sort that explains why the universe had to have had a Big Bang and why Star Trek is rubbish. But if two comedians, a clown and a rock drummer can get to grips with it, then frankly, anyone can.”\r\n\r\npunkscience: the Albert Einstein Experience is part of a centenary celebration, marking  the 100th anniversary of the publication of Einstein’s three major papers that laid the foundation of modern physics.  The Science Museum and Dana Centre will be running a programme of special exhibitions, displays and events throughout 2005.  \t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nLISTING INFORMATION: punkscience – the Albert Einstein Experience \r\n\r\nVenue: Metro Gilded Balloon Teviot – The Night Club\r\nDates: 3rd August to 28th August (excluding 15th and 22nd August)\r\nTickets:  £7.50 to £9.00\r\nTimes: 16.15 – 17.15\r\nBox Office: Metro Gilded Balloon Teviot 0131 668 1633/online www.gildedballoon.co.uk or Ed Fringe 0131 226 0000 and www.edfringe.com\t\t\r\n\r\nScience Museum Press Office: \tGilded Balloon Press Office:\r\nLauren Gildersleve\tFraser Smith/Ellie McDonald\r\nT: 0207 942 4238 / 07989 979864\tT: 0131 668 9483\r\nE: lauren.gildersleve@nmsi.ac.uk\tE: press@gildedballoon.co.uk\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 129, "added": "2005-08-23T18:49:36", "slug": "79b57a0e9755d709", "speakers": [{"id": 2804, "name": "TBC", "slug": "tbc"}], "topics": [{"id": 170, "name": "newtopic", "path": "/science/chemistry/biochemistry/catalysis/newtopic"}, {"id": 169, "name": "catalysis", "path": "/science/chemistry/biochemistry/catalysis"}, {"id": 431, "name": "science", "path": "/arts/books/science"}, {"id": 487, "name": "science", "path": "/leisure/reading/science"}], "supercategory": "science", "venue": {"id": 15, "name": "Dana Centre", "slug": "dana-centre", "city": "London", "postcode": "SW7 5HE"}, "organizer": {"id": 46, "name": "Science Museum", "slug": "science-museum"}, "date": "2005-08-28", "dates": [{"id": 2272, "from_date": "2005-08-28", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "19:00:00", "ticket_cost": "FREE", "ticket_info": "Tickets are FREE but must be pre-booked on: 020 7942 4040 or tickets@danacentre.org.uk\r\n", "additional_info": null, "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 15, "name": "Dana Centre", "slug": "dana-centre", "city": "London", "postcode": "SW7 5HE"}, "organizer": {"id": 46, "name": "Science Museum", "slug": "science-museum"}}]}, {"id": 2012, "title": "Czech Dream: Director Q&A", "synopsis": "The director and producer of Czech Dream, discuss the documentary, about the creation of a fake hypermarket.", "keywords": "Cinema\r\nDocumentary\r\nHypermarket", "body": "A provocative and highly entertaining documentary about the media, marketing and the urge to shop and consume.

In 1857 she wrote a best-selling autobiography called Wonderful Adventures of Mrs Seacole Mary Seacole in Many Lands\r\n\r\n\r\nIn her time she was as famous as Florence Nightingale but her name then faded from history. Fortunately the achievements of Mary Seacole are once more being recognised. In November 2003, a campaign was launched to have a statue of her erected in central London and in February 2004 she came first in an online poll survey of the 100 Greatest Black Britons. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe Lecture will review the life and impact of Mary Seacole from her birth in 1805 to how she is being remembered in 2005, the bicentennial year of her birth. \r\n\r\nProfessor Elizabeth Anionwu was appointed the first sickle and thalassaemia counsellor in Britain and was head of the Brent Sickle & Thalassaemia Counselling Centre between 1979 and 1990. From 1990 to 1997 she was lecturer, then senior lecturer in the Unit of Clinical Genetics and Fetal Medicine at the Institute of Child Health in London.

The minimal costs includes coffee and lunch, and a wine reception at the end.\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 480, "image_id": null, "added": "2004-05-06T13:09:17", "slug": "the-invisibility-of-nursing-research-in-practice-myth-or-reality", "speakers": [{"id": 648, "name": "Dr Loretta Bellman", "slug": "dr-loretta-bellman"}, {"id": 647, "name": "Mrs Claire Parkin", "slug": "mrs-claire-parkin"}, {"id": 649, "name": "Ms Gian Gargaro", "slug": "ms-gian-gargaro"}, {"id": 650, "name": "Ms Alison Tingle", "slug": "ms-alison-tingle"}, {"id": 651, "name": "Miss Claire Blackman", "slug": "miss-claire-blackman"}, {"id": 652, "name": "Ms Angela Grainger", "slug": "ms-angela-grainger"}, {"id": 653, "name": "Ms Lorraine Fincham", "slug": "ms-lorraine-fincham"}, {"id": 654, "name": "Ms Sharon Hamilton", "slug": "ms-sharon-hamilton"}], "topics": [{"id": 162, "name": "research", "path": "/science/research"}], "supercategory": "science", "venue": {"id": 231, "name": "Royal College of Nursing London Regional Research Society", "slug": "royal-college-of-nursing-london-regional-research-society", "city": "London", "postcode": "W1M 0AB"}, "organizer": {"id": 231, "name": "Royal College of Nursing London Regional Research Society", "slug": "royal-college-of-nursing-london-regional-research-society"}, "date": "2004-05-13", "dates": [{"id": 528, "from_date": "2004-05-13", "to_date": "2004-05-13", "time": "9:00:00", "ticket_cost": "£20 - £45 depending upon professional registration status", "ticket_info": "http://www.man.ac.uk/rcn/rs/rslond.htm\r\n", "additional_info": "For further information, please contact gian.gargaro@lshtm.ac.uk, or call Gian on 020 7927 2059.\r\n", "members_only": "No", "members_info": "To join the RCN , go to http://www.rcn.org.uk\r\n", "venue": {"id": 231, "name": "Royal College of Nursing London Regional Research Society", "slug": "royal-college-of-nursing-london-regional-research-society", "city": "London", "postcode": "W1M 0AB"}, "organizer": {"id": 231, "name": "Royal College of Nursing London Regional Research Society", "slug": "royal-college-of-nursing-london-regional-research-society"}}]}, {"id": 402, "title": "Horrid Henry's Joke Book", "synopsis": "The bestselling children's author introduces her new book Horrid Henry's Joke Book.", "keywords": "fiction", "body": "Arrive early to avoid disappointment.", "additional_info": null, "duration": null, "image_id": 41, "added": "2004-04-18T08:26:48", "slug": "f72cb3d4d7e8d293", "speakers": [{"id": 486, "name": "Francesca Simon", "slug": "francesca-simon"}], "topics": [{"id": 131, "name": "authors", "path": "/arts/literature/fiction/british/21stcentury/authors"}, {"id": 130, "name": "21stcentury", "path": "/arts/literature/fiction/british/21stcentury"}, {"id": 129, "name": "british", "path": "/arts/literature/fiction/british"}, {"id": 128, "name": "fiction", "path": "/arts/literature/fiction"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 146, "name": "Borders", "slug": "borders", "city": "London", "postcode": "N1 0PS"}, "organizer": {"id": 130, "name": "Borders UK Ltd", "slug": "borders-uk-ltd"}, "date": "2004-05-14", "dates": [{"id": 411, "from_date": "2004-05-14", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "11:00:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": null, "additional_info": null, "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 146, "name": "Borders", "slug": "borders", "city": "London", "postcode": "N1 0PS"}, "organizer": {"id": 130, "name": "Borders UK Ltd", "slug": "borders-uk-ltd"}}]}, {"id": 306, "title": "Revenge and Forgiveness", "synopsis": "As we face continuing hostilities in the Middle East, can forgiveness become a strategy for a sustainable ceasefire?", "keywords": "art, society, authority, performance", "body": "South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission demonstrated the power of forgiveness to transform long-standing conflicts.
