To some, Bell could be regarded as a feminist icon, a pioneering woman in a man’s world – a scholar, traveller, archaeologist, diplomat and curator in an era where few careers were open to women.  Until recently, Bell’s legacy was little known beyond academic circles, and like many extraordinary women she seemed destined to be hidden from history.  This lecture considers the reasons for Bell’s relative obscurity until recent times, arguing that like many exceptional women her lack of posthumous commemoration could be blamed at least partly upon the tendency for history to be written by men, about men.  On many political and social issues, Bell did little to endear herself to modern sensibilities – on matters ranging from women’s votes to vivisection, empire to ethnicity, her views are often rightly considered to have no place in the twenty-first century. Yet, Helen Berry argues in this lecture that Gertrude Bell deserves to be better known:  her contribution to contemporary politics in the Middle East has proved enduringly relevant, if controversial; her legacy to archaeology of undoubted significance.  Bell’s all-too-human tendency to live with her own contradictions are explored, as a public woman who was against women’s rights but favoured Iraqi women’s education, and as an imperialist whose preference for exile among Arab peoples made it impossible for her to return permanently to live in England. \r\n\r\n \r\nBiography: Helen Berry is Professor of British History and Dean of Postgraduate Studies at Newcastle University, home to the Gertrude Bell Archive. A prizewinning Fellow of the Royal Historical Society and Fellow of the Society of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce, she has published widely on seventeenth- and eighteenth-century history and her most recent book, The Castrato and His Wife (Oxford University Press, 2011) was a Radio 4 ‘Book of the Week.’ She has a particular interest in the history of gender and the family.  Her interest in Gertrude Bell began when she featured Bell in an exhibition, Inspirational Women of North-East England (2013) at the Hatton Gallery, Newcastle University, and she has since made a television feature on Bell for BBC1 (Inside/Out, 2014).

Philosophy is not only the pursuit of truth, but the simultaneous pursuit of beauty: and as Diotima told Socrates, “Perceive you not, that in beholding the beautiful with that eye, with which alone it is possible to behold it, thus, and thus only, could a man ever attain to generate, not the images or semblances of virtue, as not having his intimate commerce with an image or a semblance; but virtue true, real, and substantial, from the converse and embraces of that which is real and true. Thus begetting true virtue, and bringing her up till she is grown mature, he would become a favourite of the Gods; and at length would be, if any man ever be, himself one of the immortals.” The restoration of the soul’s divine likeness enlarges its powers, and enables it to join completely the empire of the Good: its work upon the earth and upon itself is thus consummated and transformed.

Ferguson’s lectures aim to push beyond naïve ideas about the success of capitalism and democracy over the past two centuries, and especially in the years since the Cold War. He will deliver the lectures in London, Edinburgh and New York, with audience contributions from the Middle East. \r\n\r\nIn this first lecture, The Human Hive, to be delivered at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) Ferguson takes as his starting point a graffito on a wall in post-Gaddafi Libya which roughly translates as: “We want a constitutional role and for the president to have less authority and the four year presidential term should not be extended.” This sounds bizarrely precise as a revolutionary slogan. But, Prof Ferguson argues, whoever wrote it had the right idea. Overthrowing a dictator and holding elections are necessary but not sufficient steps towards a free society. The devil lies in the constitutional detail. \r\n\r\nThe second lecture is entitled The Darwinian Economy.  The Landscape of Law is the title of the third lecture, and Professor Ferguson's fourth and final lecture is entitled Civil and Uncivil Societies. \r\n\r\nFerguson, born in Glasgow, is Laurence A. Tisch Professor of History at Harvard University, Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution, Stanford University and a Senior Research Fellow at Jesus College, Oxford. The author of a dozen books, he specialises in financial and economic history, as well as the history of empires. Ferguson has written and presented many major television series, most recently China: Triumph and Turmoil.  \r\n\r\nThe Reith Lectures 2012 will be recorded in June and broadcast on BBC Radio 4 and the BBC World Service from June-July. \r\n\r\nMore information about the Reith Lectures| including recordings of past Reith Lectures can be found online. \r\n\r\nSuggested hashtag for this event for Twitter users: #Reith \r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 732, "added": "2012-05-14T23:54:37", "slug": "5dd4c161db74eb59", "speakers": [{"id": 991, "name": "Professor Niall Ferguson", "slug": "professor-niall-ferguson"}, {"id": 12404, "name": "Chair: Sue Lawley", "slug": "chair-sue-lawley"}], "topics": [{"id": 2692, "name": "history", "path": "/arts/finearts/film/film/history"}, {"id": 106, "name": "wwi", "path": "/arts/books/history/military/wwi"}, {"id": 107, "name": "wwii", "path": "/arts/books/history/military/wwii"}, {"id": 108, "name": "army", "path": "/arts/books/history/military/army"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 2277, "name": "LSE Campus, venue TBC to ticket holders", "slug": "lse-campus-venue-tbc-to-ticket-holders", "city": "London ", "postcode": "WC2A 2AE"}, "organizer": {"id": 1287, "name": "London School of Economics & Political Science", "slug": "london-school-of-economics-political-science"}, "date": "2012-06-07", "dates": [{"id": 11580, "from_date": "2012-06-07", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "18:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": "This event is free and open to all however a ticket is required, only one ticket per person can be requested. \r\n\r\nMembers of the public, LSE staff, students and alumni can request one ticket via the online ticket request form which will be live on this listing after 10pm on Wednesday 30 May until at least 12noon on Thursday 31 May.

The fundamental questions are answered, leaving only the details to be filled in. The impressive achievements of science seemed to support this confident attitude. But recent research has revealed unexpected problems at the heart of physics, cosmology, biology, medicine and psychology. In his new book, launched at this event, Dr Rupert Sheldrake, one of the world’s most innovative scientists, shows how the sciences are being constricted by assumptions that have hardened into dogmas. Should science be a belief-system, or a realm of enquiry? Sheldrake shows that the “scientific worldview” is moribund. Increasingly expensive research is reaping diminishing returns. In the sceptical spirit of true scientific enquiry, Sheldrake turns the ten fundamental dogmas of science into questions, opening up startling new possibilities. The “laws of nature” may be habits that change and evolve. Minds may extend far beyond brains. The total amount of matter and energy may be increasing. Children may inherit characteristics acquired by their parents. Memories may not be stored as traces in our brains. Mental causation may work from the future towards the past, while energetic causation works from the past towards the future.

Over many years, Daniel Kahneman has conducted groundbreaking research into this – in his own words – \"machinery of the mind\". Fast thinking has extraordinary capabilities, but also faults and biases. Intuitive impressions have a pervasive influence on our thoughts and our choices. Only by understanding how the two systems work together, Kahneman shows, can we learn the truth about the role of optimism in opening up a new business, and the importance of luck in a successful corporate strategy, or the difficulties of predicting what will make us happy in the future, and the psychological pitfalls of playing the stock market. Kahneman shows where we can trust our intuitions and how we can tap into the benefits of slow thinking. He offers practical and enlightening insights into how choice are made in both our business and personal lives – and how we can guard against the mental glitches that often get us into trouble. \r\n\r\nThis public conversation between Professor Kahneman and Professor Lord Layard celebrates the publication of Kahneman's new book Thinking, Fast and Slow. \r\n\r\nDaniel Kahneman is Eugene Higgins Professor of Psychology Emeritus at Princeton University and a Professor of Public Affairs Emeritus at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs. The recipient of the 2002 Nobel Prize in Economics for his seminal work in psychology that challenged the rational model of judgment and decision making, his ideas have had a profound and widely regarded impact on many disciplines – including economics, business, law and philosophy.

The structure, a Catholic seminary built in the 1960s and abandoned twenty years later, embodies the failure of certain ambitions: architectural, civic, and spiritual. But it is the site too of a more recent disappearance. A young artist, intent on exploring the complex and its history, has gone missing among the wreckage. Months later his lover visits the place, unsure what she is looking for, and finds herself drawn into the strange nexus of energies and memories that persist there. Sanctuary is a story about what survives—of bodies, ideas, objects and the artistic or literary forms that might describe them—in the wake of catastrophe. http://www.sternberg-press.com/index.php?pageId=1300&l=en&bookId=195&sort=year%20DESC,month%20DESC\r\n\r\nMOMUS / BOOK OF JAPANS\r\n\r\nFollowing the success of The Book of Scotlands, Momus has been commissioned to write another book as part of Ingo Niermann’s Solution Series. Solution Japan, or The Book of Japans, makes a case for the rehabilitation of the idea of the “far.” We live in a time when difference and distance have been eroded and eradicated by globalization, the Internet, and cheap jet travel. The Book of Japans restores a sense of wonder—along with a plethora of imagination-triggering inaccuracies—by taking the reader on a trip not just through space but also time. http://www.sternberg-press.com/index.php?pageId=1322&l=en&bookId=217&sort=year%20DESC,month%20DESC\r\n\r\nBrian Dillon was born in Dublin in 1969.

To some, parties in local government are a democratic necessity bringing choice, identifiable policy platforms and enhanced accountability; to others, they are an undemocratic monolith, motivated by party interest and advancement, dedicated to maintaining loyalty and discipline at all costs and responsible for nationalising local government. But, which assessment is correct? In this lecture Professor Colin Copus examines the implications and impact of the involvement of national political parties in local government.\r\n\r\nProfessor Copus was awarded his PhD from Queen Mary and Westfield and has an MA and a local government post-graduate professional qualification.

He began his academic career at the West London Institute of Higher Education, where he had undertaken part-time study and then moved to an academic post at Wolverhampton University. His research interests are local party politics, local democracy and the role of the councillor; he has published widely in these areas with recent books exploring local politics and directly elected mayors.\r\n\r\nPlease book online or contact our Events Office on (0116) 257 7452 or eventsoffice@dmu.ac.uk", "additional_info": null, "duration": 60, "image_id": null, "added": "2010-12-14T20:37:32", "slug": "be79d55232f31ed3", "speakers": [{"id": 10575, "name": "Professor Colin Copus", "slug": "professor-colin-copus"}], "topics": [{"id": 527, "name": "politics", "path": "/politics/local/politics"}, {"id": 938, "name": "politics", "path": "/politics/philosophy/politics"}], "supercategory": "politics", "venue": {"id": 2358, "name": "Hugh Aston Building", "slug": "hugh-aston-building", "city": "Leicester", "postcode": "LE1 9BH"}, "organizer": {"id": 1717, "name": "Professorial Lecture Series", "slug": "professorial-lecture-series"}, "date": "2011-04-07", "dates": [{"id": 9539, "from_date": "2011-04-07", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "18:00:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": "To book a place or for more information please email Daniel Jones at djones@dmu.ac.uk or telephone 0116 257 7452", "additional_info": "Places must be booked in advance as there are limited places.

And on the tiny stage of one of these - the 2I's Coffee Bar - many legendary musicians began their careers. \r\n\r\nAndrew will describe how the dark basement of the 2i's at 59 Old Compton Street became a focal point for British skiffle and emerging rock 'n' roll. The Vipers were the first skiffle group who really 'hit the spot' and took up residency at the 2I's bar. Tommy Steele was the undoubted star of its early line up, while Cliff Richard performed at the 2I's as part of The Drifters. Adam Faith's band, The Worried Men, became a regular fixture at the 2I's, where they also appeared on the BBC's live music series the Six-Five Special in the late 1950s. Artists such as Marty Wilde, Vince Taylor and Terry Dene all made their debuts there and became part of the British history of rock 'n' roll. \r\n\r\nComposer Lionel Bart could also be found in the 2I's, serving customers, while future producer Mickie Most was employed as a singing waiter. Aspiring musicians came along hoping to be spotted by impresarios and promoters such as Jack Good, Larry Parnes and Don Arden. Hence the 2I's became the bridge between musical talent and finding fame and fortune in potential record deals. \r\n \r\nAndrew Ings has written many articles for a range of titles for over 20 years. These have included theatrical reviews for a number of newspapers and magazines such as Arts East, Centre Stage, the Jazz Rag and the Guardian. He has also written a number of sketches for the stage and his first book was published in 2001. Andrew has broadcast on the arts, focusing on the theatre in particular, and was a contributor to a weekly radio programme on the arts for more than three years. He currently works freelance for a number of theatres in London.

While many neuroscientists stress the role of neurochemicals in the brain as a key driver of behaviour, our legal system is based on the ethical notion of personal responsibility, albeit to different degrees. This sets up an interesting tension between differing accounts of behaviour and motivation and poses the intriguing question: to what extent are we really responsible for our actions? This question will be examined by our panel of distinguished speakers from four different angles: social psychology, clinical hypnosis, neuroscience and law. The resulting discussion will give us a clearer and probably more complex understanding of the relationship between inner psychological and outer social factors.

Bioepistemic evolution is not gene-centred but data-centred and views all evolution as being a data process; it regards genes as simply formatting some of the data in DNA. This talk will very briefly summarize the bioepistemic approach to evolution and its interpretation of the general pattern of human sexualities.\r\n\r\nViewed from this perspective human nature appears as the product of a multilevel selection involving two large, inherited data pools, genes and culture. That is, human evolution is primarily gene-cultural and, it will be argued, culture can be viewed as the phenotypic target for human sexual selection. Human sexuality may therefore be seen not just in terms of biological reproduction, but also in terms of social pair and social group formation and in terms of the maintenance and reproduction of the social groups necessary to sustain culture.\r\n\r\nIt will be suggested that the bioepistemic approach can offer a broader and more integrated understanding of the evolutionary origin of the various human sexualities than can more conventional approaches.\r\n\r\nJohn Hewitt is a former teacher and has worked as a research scientist in Molecular Biology, and lectured in Biochemistry  at the University of Cambridge.", "additional_info": null, "duration": 120, "image_id": null, "added": "2010-01-21T17:27:34", "slug": "0179216fe399a162", "speakers": [{"id": 9312, "name": "Mr John Hewitt", "slug": "mr-john-hewitt"}], "topics": [{"id": 1398, "name": "evolution", "path": "/academic/science/philosophy/engineering/biology/medicine/evolut"}, {"id": 1399, "name": "evolution", "path": "/academic/science/philosophy/engineering/biology/medicine/evolut"}, {"id": 1474, "name": "culture", "path": "/academic/society/culture/culture"}, {"id": 408, "name": "love", "path": "/arts/poetry/love"}], "supercategory": "academic", "venue": {"id": 704, "name": "Conway Hall", "slug": "conway-hall", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC1R 4RL"}, "organizer": {"id": 704, "name": "Conway Hall", "slug": "conway-hall"}, "date": "2010-02-14", "dates": [{"id": 8069, "from_date": "2010-02-14", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "11:00:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": null, "additional_info": null, "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 704, "name": "Conway Hall", "slug": "conway-hall", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC1R 4RL"}, "organizer": {"id": 704, "name": "Conway Hall", "slug": "conway-hall"}}]}, {"id": 7661, "title": "Early Events in Monocot Evolution", "synopsis": "Joint meeting with Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew", "keywords": "monocots\r\nkew\r\nevolution", "body": "This three-day meeting, held in honour of RBG Kew’s Araceae specialist Simon Mayo on his official retirement, will focus on early branches of the monocot phylogeny.

Thinking about the promise, risk, and plausibility of AI and VRs\r\n\r\nWith Amon Twyman\r\n2pm-4pm, Saturday 11th July 2009\r\n\r\nTranshumanism is a broad set of ideas and niche interests which collectively address the impact of technology on the human condition. The most radical thought experiments entertained by transhumanists often involve some reference to Artificial Intelligence (AI) and/or Virtual Reality (VR), and can be classed as Extreme Simulation Scenarios (ESS). Such scenarios can be equal parts attractive and disturbing. They describe conditions of radical liberation from traditional human constraints, but also open up entirely new categories of potential risk. Evaluations of ESS frequently conflate assessments of promise, risk, technological credibility, and congruence with extant belief systems.\r\n\r\nThis presentation will disentangle the various threads within ESS evaluation as follows:\r\n\r\n(1) explaining key ESS concepts such as uploads, utility fog, and virtual autonomous zones;\r\n(2) describing the principal extreme simulation scenarios and their historical roots;\r\n(3) evaluating specific criticisms of ESS; and\r\n(4) considering the degree to which assessments of ESS are often a matter of opposed assumptions and worldviews rather than the unprejudiced examination of evidence.\r\n\r\nCome along and learn how to think critically and constructively about some of the most revolutionary transhumanist ideas, and how they relate to our current culture and technology.\r\n\r\nAbout the speaker\r\n\r\nAmon Twyman is a cognitive scientist and artist based in London. His work within cognitive psychology at University College London has investigated the role of conscious awareness in decision making, and he has explored transhumanist themes as a member of electro-industrial band Xykogen.\r\n\r\nThere is no charge to attend and everyone is welcome.

Duhamel's first major score was for Godard's _Pierrot le fou_, and they renewed their collaboration for _Weekend_. \r\n\r\nWe are delighted to welcome Antoine Duhamel who will show extracts from these two major films and discuss the importance of music in the cinema of Jean-Luc Godard.\r\n\r\nh3. More about _For Ever Godard_\r\n\r\nh4. Film retrospective 2—29 July 2004\r\n\r\nThere have been many unique talents in the history of cinema, but few can compare with the highly individual genius that is Jean-Luc Godard. He has been making films for almost half of cinema's own lifetime, and it was clear from the start—with his dazzling debut feature _Breathless_—that he was taking film into the future even as he was honouring its past. \r\n\r\nAs a new book addressing the multiple aspects of Godard's cinema is launched— _For Ever Godard_ (Black Dog Publishing)—we re-examine some of his key works in the company of filmmakers, critics, academics and Godard's own collaborators - Raoul Coutard and Antoine Duhamel - to discover how one of cinema's most notorious 'enfants terribles' has evolved into an elder statesman without ever losing his talent for invention or his taste for exuberant provocation.\r\n\r\nOur season features films from every period of Godard's mercurial career, and looks forward to the forthcoming release of his latest work, _Notre musique_. Godard is blessed with a musical eye and a visual ear, and sound plays a vital role in his work: he is a determinedly audio-visual artist whose films bear comparison with works by the great modern composers. Constantly pushing the boundaries of cinema, Godard does not always succeed, but his failures make some others' successes appear pallid and empty. His films are playful, challenging, engaging, demanding, entertaining and illuminating, but never boring. He has been an inspiration for generations of international filmmakers, so much so that his famous 1958 declaration (\"Cinema *is* Nicholas Ray\") might now be rewritten: for many true lovers of film, Cinema *is* Jean-Luc Godard.\r\n\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": null, "image_id": 183, "added": "2004-07-15T08:12:51", "slug": "d919e0f85f9a6390", "speakers": [{"id": 1265, "name": "Antoine Duhamel", "slug": "antoine-duhamel"}], "topics": [{"id": 470, "name": "french", "path": "/arts/film/french"}, {"id": 19, "name": "retrospectives", "path": "/arts/film/retrospectives"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 262, "name": "Institut Francais", "slug": "institut-francais", "city": "London", "postcode": "SW7 2DT"}, "organizer": {"id": 262, "name": "Institut Francais", "slug": "institut-francais"}, "date": "2004-07-16", "dates": [{"id": 1083, "from_date": "2004-07-16", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "19:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Tickets £7, 5£ Members and Concessions", "ticket_info": "\"Box-Office\":http://www.institut-francais.org.uk/cinema/ci_boxoffice.php \r\n\r\nContact - 0207 073 1350 \r\n\r\n* Members of the Institut français and Ciné Lumière £ 5 \r\n* School & group rates (more than 10 people) £3\r\n* Double bill, special events and premières £9, Concessions £7. \r\n\r\nPayment by Credit card (Visa, Delta, Switch, Mastercard) or cheque.\r\n\r\nh3.
