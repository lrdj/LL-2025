They built up the Herbert family, their lives tower over their men folk for spark, personal strengths, and surprising, compelling stories of their origins & achievements.\r\nThese interesting women stand out to form a lasting legacy of their own when recounting how they ran Highclere as the Earl’s wife, mother to the Earl’s children, the house chatelaine ( managing dozens of servants) , and a busy hostess charged with receiving and entertaining VIPs of the era.\r\nBetween 1793 and 1939 the period of the First to the Sixth Countesses of Carnarvon the eight remarkable woman who held the title make a quixotic mix. The first three Countesses in succession Elizabeth, Kitty and Henrietta were wealthy heiresses drawn from some of the great peerage families of England, including the Wyndhams, Acland and Howard nobility (the last mentioned had links to the Dukes of Norfolk). The 4th Countess Evelyn Stanhope was an Earl’s daughter, a Royal Courtier, energetic horse woman and dynamic political hostess but who died young. She was followed by another member of the Howard clan, Elsie, a smart, hedonistic woman who strangled Herbert history by the deletion of large chunks of her husband’s (the 4th Earl’s) diaries in order to suppress the true nature of his relationship with his eldest son and heir and hide the horrific evidence of scandal, family flaws and bad genes. Next came the ‘Pocket Venus’, Almina Wombwell, the petite, cunning, 5th Countess who added more wealth from out of the Rothschild banking family. Almina was misled and frustrated by a perverted spouse ( a man who later claimed fame as the discoverer of Tutankhamun). The 5th Earl brought in surrogacy arrangements and ditched the Herbert bloodline in favour of a dangerous adage to the gene pool from his best friend, an Indian Prince. Rumours were rife. Lies were lavishly told. Money was paid to keep secrets subdued. History was altered. On a higher level Almina became a pioneering nurse in the Great War, later matron at a series of plush nursing homes and beyond this she was the longest lived of the Carnarvon women.\r\nThe first of the two Sixth Countesses Catherine Wendell was a glamorous American who grew up in England, she was popular with Highclere staff but badly treated, sacrificed and humiliated by her womanising husband, Porchey, a bullying sex pest. Catherine turned to drink, she eventually found love, with affairs with several high placed men including the musician, Malcolm Sargent. Then came Tilly Losch , the second 6th Countess, an Austrian Jewess, talented ballet dancer ( famous for her ‘ Dance of Hands’ routine) and a film and stage star sought temporary safety as war loomed by marriage to the 6th Earl in 1939. Hers was the shortest tenure as Highclere Castle’s chatelaine, just ten weeks before she fled to the USA. In America Tilly had once been a Holywood figure in her early days, and a limelight act on the London stage working with the legendry Noel Coward and Cocky Cochran in the late 1920s and Fred Astaire in New York in the early 1930s. Tilly used her sexual favours to lure men and women into her bed. She kept a score card of those who were caught up in her web.\r\nWilliam Cross, FSA Scot the author of six books on the Herberts of Highclere offers an entertaining insight into these eight women whose like we shall never see again.\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 2249, "added": "2017-07-12T15:23:57", "slug": "2f7bedfb6826fa16", "speakers": [{"id": 13766, "name": "Mr William  Cross", "slug": "mr-william-cross"}], "topics": [{"id": 1729, "name": "royalty", "path": "/society/history/17thcentury/royalty"}, {"id": 1479, "name": "women", "path": "/religion/judaism/jewishidentity/women"}, {"id": 2344, "name": "women", "path": "/society/law/international/women"}, {"id": 2428, "name": "women", "path": "/academic/politics/greatbritain/women"}], "supercategory": "society", "venue": {"id": 3165, "name": "Newport Hard of Hearing Club", "slug": "newport-hard-of-hearing-club", "city": "Newport", "postcode": "NP20 1HG"}, "organizer": {"id": 2861, "name": "William Cross, FSA Scot", "slug": "william-cross-fsa-scot"}, "date": "2017-10-18", "dates": [{"id": 16454, "from_date": "2017-10-18", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "14:00:00", "ticket_cost": "Members and Guests", "ticket_info": "See Club Secretary", "additional_info": "William Cross, FSA Scot is the author of six books on the Herberts of Highclere CAstle.

Investigating more than a dozen camps, from the infamous Dachau, Buchenwald, and Sachsenhausen to less familiar sites, the study uncovers a process of terror meant to identify and isolate Jews from German society and economy. The book analyses the function of terror in this process of turning ‘Germans’ into ‘Jews’ and forcing them into emigration. It also investigates Jewish responses and resistance to this most brutal form of exclusion.\r\n\r\nDr Kim Wünschmann is DAAD Lecturer in Modern European History and Acting Deputy Director of the Centre for German-Jewish Studies at the University of Sussex.

Combining extensive new research into the pre-war history of Dachau with insights from interdisciplinary scholarship on perpetrator violence, the book analyses the socialization of thousands of often very young males into the values of concentration camp service. It appraises the contributions of ideology, careerism, institutional dynamics, and ideals of masculinity to this process and explores the legacies of the Dachau School for the wartime criminality of the Third Reich.\r\n\r\nDr Christopher Dillon is a Lecturer in Modern European History at King’s College London.

What had been a minor regional school achieved international prominence and influenced the future of European art in general for centuries. Central to this achievement was the genius of a succession of painters from Giovanni Bellini and his brother Gentile, Carpaccio, Giorgione, to the great Titian and his younger contemporaries Tintoretto and Veronese. These painters worked in a city undergoing crisis and change: the decline of its maritime empire, the reduction of its monopoly of trade with the East, its near destruction as a state in the early sixteenth century, and the religious turmoil engendered by the Reformation and the reaction of the Roman Church to it. Governed by an oligarchy of merchant nobles who elected a Doge, Venice remained politically stable throughout this turbulent period and continued to flourish economically. The state, the lay confraternities (called scuole) and private individuals provided sufficient patronage and support for a brilliant school of painting to develop in both secular and religious art. The cultural context and history of this school will be studied in eight lectures, followed by a full-day visit to the National Gallery to consider first-hand its outstanding collection of Venetian renaissance paintings.\r\n \r\n\r\n", "keywords": "arts, art, history, Renaissance Venice, Giovanni Bellini, Antonello da Messina, 'Sacra Conversazione', Titian, public paintings, eligious paintings", "body": "Despite its secular aspects, Venice was a very religious city and the patronage of religious art remained paramount in the Renaissance. Between the 1470s and the 1520s the nature of the Venetian church altarpiece changed fundamentally. Departing from the gold-leafed polyptychs of the Gothic age, Giovanni Bellini and the Netherlandish-trained Antonello da Messina created a new kind of altarpiece in Venice: the 'Sacra Conversazione', where all the figures were united in a single space, now painted in oil not tempera and with greater naturalism. This paradigm was then itself challenged by a younger generation of artists around 1510, principally Titian, ultimately resulting in the creation of the more dramatic 'narrative' altarpiece, where the action is displayed in the main field and not in a small predella underneath it. These large-scale, public paintings will be contrasted with smaller religious paintings for private devotion in the Venetian home.", "additional_info": null, "duration": 300, "image_id": null, "added": "2014-05-02T09:34:40", "slug": "b8b5cf337b3e9766", "speakers": [{"id": 14666, "name": "Dr Michael Douglas-Scott", "slug": "dr-michael-douglas-scott"}], "topics": [{"id": 131, "name": "authors", "path": "/arts/literature/fiction/british/21stcentury/authors"}, {"id": 106, "name": "wwi", "path": "/arts/books/history/military/wwi"}, {"id": 107, "name": "wwii", "path": "/arts/books/history/military/wwii"}, {"id": 108, "name": "army", "path": "/arts/books/history/military/army"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 2725, "name": "The University Women's Club", "slug": "the-university-womens-club", "city": "London", "postcode": "W1K 1DB"}, "organizer": {"id": 2290, "name": "THE COURSE", "slug": "the-course"}, "date": "2014-10-02", "dates": [{"id": 14172, "from_date": "2014-10-02", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "10:45:00", "ticket_cost": "£46", "ticket_info": "info@thecoursestudies.co.uk", "additional_info": "visit www.thecoursestudies.co.uk", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 2725, "name": "The University Women's Club", "slug": "the-university-womens-club", "city": "London", "postcode": "W1K 1DB"}, "organizer": {"id": 2290, "name": "THE COURSE", "slug": "the-course"}}]}, {"id": 13518, "title": "Global Warming-Where Do We Go From Here?", "synopsis": "Radical suggestions and solutions on how to respond to the threat of global warming.", "keywords": "Science, global warming, climate change, modern world, environment.", "body": "Global warming is considered to be a key threat to the modern world, though our response to it continues to be a source of great debate.

The numerous facets of the 'monstrous lesbian' notions included the idea that a heterosexual woman could be ensnared by one of these dangerous creatures; there was the idea that homosexuality could be 'caught' like a disease from them. This sort of lesbian represented a threat to the natural order of society, for she would steal away men's wives and daughters, and defied taming.

The role of the 2008 global campaign by the world's zoos, the ‘Year of the Frog’, in catalyzing required funding and stimulating both government and public action will also be described.\r\n\r\nOrganised by Lesley Dickie (EAZA & Amphibian Ark), Kevin Zippel (Amphibian Ark) and Jenny Pramuk (WCS).\r\n\r\nFor further details or to book your place, please see www.zsl.org/science/scientific-meetings/ or contact Joy Hayward, Scientific Meetings Coordinator, Zoological Society of London, Regent's Park, London NW1 4RY; tel: +44 (0) 207 449 6227; fax: +44 (0) 207 449 6411; e-mail: joy.hayward@zsl.org.", "additional_info": null, "duration": 480, "image_id": 1045, "added": "2008-09-19T08:28:23", "slug": "halting-the-global-decline-in-amphibians-a-2-day-zsl-and-wcs-joint-symposium-day-1", "speakers": [{"id": 7384, "name": "Please see link for full details", "slug": "please-see-link-for-full-details"}], "topics": [{"id": 1267, "name": "naturalhistory", "path": "/academic/science/naturalhistory"}, {"id": 1003, "name": "wildlife", "path": "/leisure/wildlife/wildlife"}, {"id": 1115, "name": "wildlife", "path": "/science/environment/wildlife"}, {"id": 676, "name": "naturalhistory", "path": "/academic/naturalhistory"}, {"id": 1105, "name": "ecology", "path": "/science/ecology"}, {"id": 818, "name": "climatechange", "path": "/science/climatechange"}, {"id": 159, "name": "biodiversity", "path": "/science/biology/biodiversity"}, {"id": 467, "name": "zoology", "path": "/science/zoology"}, {"id": 232, "name": "frogs", "path": "/science/biology/frogs"}], "supercategory": "academic", "venue": {"id": 1028, "name": "ZSL London Zoo's Meeting Rooms", "slug": "zsl-london-zoos-meeting-rooms", "city": "London", "postcode": "NW1 4RY"}, "organizer": {"id": 685, "name": "The Zoological Society of London", "slug": "the-zoological-society-of-london"}, "date": "2008-11-20", "dates": [{"id": 6141, "from_date": "2008-11-20", "to_date": "2008-11-20", "time": "9:00:00", "ticket_cost": "£120 for both days; £70 per day. 50% discount for students and ZSL Members.", "ticket_info": "This is a two-day symposium to be held on Thursday 20 and Friday 21 November 2008.
