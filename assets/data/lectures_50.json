Participants will be given plenty of opportunities to ask questions and make points from the floor:\r\n\r\nEquality, Equity and the dispossessed\r\n The notions of equality and equity are widely used and yet people’s understanding of their meaning differs hugely. This can make it difficult to know what people are talking about when they argue for greater equality - is it equal rights? Equal access to education? Equal opportunity? Equal pay? All of the above?

Originating as The Hype, the band later became better known as the Spiders from Mars. It was under this guise that the band released their hit single Starman and produced the landmark conceptual album: The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars. Launching Bowie’s androgynous fictional character - Ziggy Stardust - into the spotlight, this became a pinnacle point in both their careers with Woodmansey’s distinctive drumming style helping to define the sound. This year marks the album’s 40th anniversary and consequently, is an opportune moment to reflect upon the band’s heyday, celebrating their success through these cultural events.\r\n\r\nIn addition to touring extensively with Bowie and also appearing on the much acclaimed albums The Man Who Sold the World, Hunky Dory and Aladdin Sane, Woodmansey has worked with Dexy’s Midnight Runners, Paul McCartney, Art Garfunkel, Joe Elliott and Gillian Glover. Pursuing his own projects, his albums have included an eponymous album after Bowie from the Spiders From Mars, followed by Woody Woodmansey’s U-Boat in 1977 and Future Primitive by 3-D in 2007.\r\n\r\nTom Wilcox is a Director of the ICA, and a Partner at Counterculture; an arts consultancy practice. He was previously Managing Director of Whitechapel Gallery for almost seven years during the gallery’s major expansion which was completed in 2009. As a musician, Tom achieved the coveted single of the week accolade in Kerrang! magazine with his band Maniac Squat. He has also released records with The Chavs, with Gillian Glover and Maggi Ronson as a producer, and has composed music for television. \r\n\r\nWith thanks to Maryam and Edward Eisler.", "additional_info": null, "duration": 60, "image_id": null, "added": "2012-08-30T12:40:23", "slug": "2441c8047c6ef925", "speakers": [{"id": 12654, "name": "Woody Woodmansey", "slug": "woody-woodmansey"}, {"id": 12655, "name": "Tom  Wilcox", "slug": "tom-wilcox"}], "topics": [{"id": 1474, "name": "culture", "path": "/academic/society/culture/culture"}, {"id": 2719, "name": "culture", "path": "/academic/history/gender/culture"}, {"id": 314, "name": "culture", "path": "/arts/philosophy/culture"}, {"id": 1248, "name": "culture", "path": "/academic/society/culture"}], "supercategory": "academic", "venue": {"id": 1394, "name": "ICA", "slug": "ica", "city": "London", "postcode": "SW1Y 4AH"}, "organizer": {"id": 1394, "name": "ICA", "slug": "ica"}, "date": "2012-08-31", "dates": [{"id": 11777, "from_date": "2012-08-31", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "13:00:00", "ticket_cost": "£5 / free to ICA Members", "ticket_info": null, "additional_info": null, "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 1394, "name": "ICA", "slug": "ica", "city": "London", "postcode": "SW1Y 4AH"}, "organizer": {"id": 1394, "name": "ICA", "slug": "ica"}}]}, {"id": 11269, "title": "A question and answer of sport", "synopsis": "Experts in the field of sports injury and medicine will talk about their work and answer questions from the audience.", "keywords": "Injury\r\nathletes\r\nsurgery\r\nsports", "body": "From sprained hamstrings to broken metatarsals – sporting injuries are often in the news, especially if they occur during a major event.

M1 5LE.\r\n\r\nWhat in most places of our contemporary world has degenerated into a mere commemorative event, in former cultures and societies constituted a central cultus and supreme magical gateway into the numinous. This talk aims at providing important insights into hidden forms of the Death Cult and ancestral worship as pathways into ‘night-consciousness’, a magical state of awareness through which alone we can manifest a supreme ecstatic and fearless state of Gnostic Being. Covering topics as diverse as soul, the fetich, God-eating, Eros, the daemonic and esoteric intoxication, the lecture will discuss the spiritual, magical and occult implications of this ritualistic cultus and its import as a foundation for an individual sorcery, paganism and the gnostic path.\r\n\r\nDavid Beth was born to German parents in Africa, and has been the main contemporary force in the revival of Esoteric Voudon. He is the founder of La Société Voudon Gnostique, a selective group of international initiates and artists dedicated to manifesting the more powerful, inner revelations and transmissions of the Gods of Voudon, as well as to push evolution and research of Gnosis and esotericism freely beyond all frontiers of orthodoxy. Having received empowerments and initiation into various systems of spirituality, David is also the Hierophant of the Ecclesia Gnostica Aeterna. University educated in Germany and the USA, he has travelled and lived all over the world from Nigeria to Hamburg, from Los Angeles to London, fully devoted to his esoteric quest. As a spiritual teacher and author, David lives and works between Europe and Brasil. His books and essays have been published in various places.\r\n\r\nPrice: £7.50 per person\r\n\r\nTime: 6:30-7:00, for a 7:30 start\r\n\r\nIn what is in all likelihood his only UK talk of the year, Diabolical Discourse, fresh from the flames, is incredibly happy to welcome David back once more to the north. Following his scintillating lecture, and the ensuing incredibly lively debate of just under two years ago, all I can say is if you missed that, you certainly don't want to miss this!\r\n\r\nOn a personal level, my thanks to David for getting things up and running once more; given support from you wonderfvl folk, events will become regular and what we started two years ago will continue for many more!\r\n\r\nTo reserve places Paypal payments can be made directly to cerne@hotmail.co.uk.

However, when given a magnitude estimation scale which allows for intermediate responses, child comprehenders do penalise over-informative utterances and rate them lower than optimal ones. \r\n\r\nThese findings support the pragmatic tolerance hypothesis; a novel account which predicts that in certain cases children are in fact pragmatically competent both as speakers and as comprehenders and what develops with age is their metalinguistic awareness about accepting or rejecting pragmatically infelicitous utterances.\r\n\r\nI will also present new on-line data which suggests that five-year-olds are adept at recognising when utterances contain excessive, irrelevant detail.

An individual might decide what they would like to do and then aim to benefit exclusively from the fruits of their labour, contracting and allying with other people as needed: let’s call that the liberal approach. Alternatively a group of people might come to understand that they have a common set of interests and goals, then work together to hit those goals and take collective credit for the products of their endeavour: let’s call that the collectivist approach.\r\n\r\nBoth liberalism and collectivism in these definitions understand the interaction of people through end products and their ownership. What is missing from them is an account of cooperation itself. To what extent is knowledge held in social practices – the social sum being greater than individual parts? Whether one takes a liberal or collective view of the ownership of the products of labour, can either be reconciled to an admiration for craftsmanship, a concept which contains collaborative effort down the ages? Does a cooperative approach inevitably quash individuality and creativity?\r\n\r\nRichard Sennett is an eminent sociologist whose work is also rich in historical, philosophical and psychological perspectives influencing his view of the city, the public sphere, collaboration, cooperation and competition, to name but a few of his interests.

While this right hemisphere contribution to language processing in the patient population might impinge normal conversational capacities, the same processes in the general population might facilitate creative thinking. Studies using neuropharmacological manipulations (dopamine agonistic treatment) support the view that magical belief in the general population is not simply on the continuum to psychosis, but might reflect a well-adapted personality dimension showing evolutionary advantages.  \r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Mohr did her PhD on the \"neuropsychology of magical belief\" at the University of Zurich, Switzerland, and continued working in this field ever since. In 2004, she joined the Department of Experimental Psychology at the University of Bristol as a lecturer where she teaches Neuropsychiatry. With respect to paranormal belief, she mainly investigates and publishes on the neuropsychological correlates of these beliefs, and aims to understand why some individuals with such \"bizarre\" beliefs are considered by most as absolutely healthy (but spiritual), while in others it is considered pathological (psychotic). This is particularly relevant, because the dimensional, or rather quasi-dimensional view of psychosis would indicate that the healthy expression might have evolutionary advantages.

For this reason the UK has a wealth of data going back more than two centuries.  These data take many forms; from an individual’s records of the timing of a single event, such as frog spawning in their garden pond, to records from national networks of protocol-controlled data collection.  This lecture will cover some of the history of phenology, pausing to reveal the sometimes peculiar sources of data, and give an overview of current recording.  Examples will be given of the changes already taking place, despite relatively modest climate warming so far.  In many species, phenological response to a changing climate is much stronger and much easier to detect than other climate impacts.  Consequently it is highly important in raising awareness of climate change, in getting people involved in monitoring, and in identifying possible adverse consequences of future warming.\r\n\r\nDr Tim Sparks is an environmental scientist at the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology at Monks Wood.  He was instrumental in resurrecting a national network of recorders of phenology (the timing of events) that is now, in partnership with the Woodland Trust, in its tenth year.  He has undertaken extensive research on the impacts of climate change on plants and animals, with an emphasis on changes in phenology.  To this end he makes considerable use of current and historic data and collaborates widely, both within the UK and elsewhere in Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 120, "image_id": null, "added": "2007-08-23T21:22:19", "slug": "british-wildlife-and-climate-change-phenology-the-timing-of-natural-events", "speakers": [{"id": 5800, "name": "Dr Tim Sparks", "slug": "dr-tim-sparks"}], "topics": [{"id": 676, "name": "naturalhistory", "path": "/academic/naturalhistory"}, {"id": 217, "name": "botany", "path": "/science/biology/botany"}, {"id": 159, "name": "biodiversity", "path": "/science/biology/biodiversity"}, {"id": 868, "name": "climate", "path": "/science/climatechange/climate"}, {"id": 215, "name": "entomology", "path": "/science/biology/entomology"}, {"id": 335, "name": "ornithology", "path": "/science/biology/ornithology"}, {"id": 868, "name": "climate", "path": "/science/climatechange/climate"}, {"id": 1117, "name": "conservation", "path": "/science/ecology/conservation"}, {"id": 1115, "name": "wildlife", "path": "/science/environment/wildlife"}, {"id": 1165, "name": "zoology", "path": "/science/naturalhistory/zoology"}], "supercategory": "academic", "venue": {"id": 1433, "name": "at a Birkbeck lecture theatre/University of London", "slug": "at-a-birkbeck-lecture-theatreuniversity-of-london", "city": "London", "postcode": "W C1E"}, "organizer": {"id": 1069, "name": "Ecology and Conservation Studies Society", "slug": "ecology-and-conservation-studies-society"}, "date": "2007-10-12", "dates": [{"id": 4782, "from_date": "2007-10-12", "to_date": "2007-10-12", "time": "18:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": "For free tickets and venue details, contact tel:  020 7679 1069, or e-mail:   environment@fce.bbk.ac.uk", "additional_info": "For queries on lecture content, contact tel:  020 7485 7903, or e-mail:   jeremy.wright@walkern.org.uk", "members_only": "No", "members_info": "Details of the Society and application forms will be available at the door, and are on our website http://www.bbk.ac.uk/ce/environment/ecssociety/index.shtml", "venue": {"id": 1433, "name": "at a Birkbeck lecture theatre/University of London", "slug": "at-a-birkbeck-lecture-theatreuniversity-of-london", "city": "London", "postcode": "W C1E"}, "organizer": {"id": 1069, "name": "Ecology and Conservation Studies Society", "slug": "ecology-and-conservation-studies-society"}}]}, {"id": 4442, "title": "John Keane: Painting is History", "synopsis": "Artist John keane traces teh development of his work over the past thirty years.", "keywords": "Contemporary, Louise T Blouin Institute, Art, Architecture, painting, politics", "body": "Artist John Keane will trace the development of his work over the last 30 years and discuss how he has sought to address unfolding contemporary history, with particular reference to conflict and the pursuit of violence for political ends. \r\nKeane was Official British War Artist during the Gulf War and has since explored a variety of subjects, the most recent being the Moscow Theatre Siege.\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 60, "image_id": null, "added": "2007-06-14T12:16:27", "slug": "587c63a5af360efd", "speakers": [{"id": 2033, "name": "Professor John Keane", "slug": "professor-john-keane"}], "topics": [{"id": 608, "name": "contemporary", "path": "/arts/literature/francophone/poetry/contemporary"}, {"id": 612, "name": "contemporary", "path": "/arts/books/poetry/french/contemporary"}, {"id": 385, "name": "architecture", "path": "/arts/museums/architecture"}, {"id": 337, "name": "painting", "path": "/arts/art/painting"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 1185, "name": "Louise T Blouin Institute", "slug": "louise-t-blouin-institute", "city": "London", "postcode": "W11 4BE"}, "organizer": {"id": 1185, "name": "Louise T Blouin Institute", "slug": "louise-t-blouin-institute"}, "date": "2007-08-07", "dates": [{"id": 4642, "from_date": "2007-08-07", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "18:30:00", "ticket_cost": "£5 or free for concessions/members", "ticket_info": "The Institute.

Zimbardo, who has written a book, 'The Lucifer Effect: how good people turn evil', in which he attempts to understand and explain, for example, the torture by American soldiers (male and female) of the individuals in their custody at Abu Ghraib Jail, 20 miles west of Baghdad.Professor Philip Zimbardo acted as expert witness for one of the senior American guards prosecuted, (who received an 8 year sentence), and so had unlimited access to all photographic evidence and the transcripts of all prosecution and defense testimonies.\r\n\r\nPhil's new book (published 15 March, 2007 by Random House)explores in depth and with caring, the psychological and spiritual potential for evil as well as heroism, that he concludes lives in all of us. Tellingly, his book's last sentence quotes from the Gulag veteran and Nobel laureate, Alexander\r\nSolzenitsyn: 'The line between good and evil is in the center of every human heart'.\r\n\r\nDuring his week in England, he will be interviewed by a host of broadsheets, and is scheduled to appear on Radio 4's Start the Week, as well as other national media.\r\n\r\nNow age 74, Philip grew up in the economic poverty of an immigrant family in New York C\r\nCity's South Bronx ghetto, and rose to be the 2002 Elected President of the American Psychological Association (and its 150,000 members). He researched for some 47 years mostly at Stanford University where, as you know too well, he first came to world-wide attention with his Stanford Prison Experiment in the early 1970s. In his time, Phil has also researched as broadly as\r\nShyness, Evil (violence, torture, terrorism), and Hypnosis (visit www.Zimbardo.com). He is married with three grown-up children.\r\n\r\nVisit: www.LuciferEffect.org\r\n\r\nWe look forward to seeing you at this timely and interesting event.\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": null, "added": "2007-03-28T05:23:07", "slug": "the-lucifer-effect-understanding-how-good-people-turn-evil", "speakers": [{"id": 5282, "name": "Professor Philip Zimbardo", "slug": "professor-philip-zimbardo"}], "topics": [{"id": 380, "name": "crime", "path": "/arts/literature/fiction/crime"}, {"id": 372, "name": "psychology", "path": "/academic/philosophy/psychology"}, {"id": 1164, "name": "psychology", "path": "/science/naturalhistory/psychology"}, {"id": 149, "name": "brain", "path": "/science/psychology/brain"}, {"id": 1114, "name": "criminaljustice", "path": "/academic/law/criminaljustice"}, {"id": 933, "name": "humanrightslaw", "path": "/academic/law/humanrightslaw"}, {"id": 182, "name": "law", "path": "/society/law"}, {"id": 654, "name": "medicallaw", "path": "/academic/law/medicallaw"}, {"id": 823, "name": "police", "path": "/academic/law/police"}, {"id": 959, "name": "debate", "path": "/religion/debate"}, {"id": 199, "name": "conflict", "path": "/society/conflict"}, {"id": 370, "name": "ethics", "path": "/society/ethics"}, {"id": 268, "name": "humanrights", "path": "/society/humanrights"}, {"id": 528, "name": "society", "path": "/society/society"}, {"id": 421, "name": "war", "path": "/society/war"}, {"id": 199, "name": "conflict", "path": "/society/conflict"}, {"id": 196, "name": "iraq", "path": "/politics/iraq"}, {"id": 636, "name": "waronterror", "path": "/politics/waronterror"}, {"id": 1, "name": "academic", "path": "/academic"}, {"id": 80, "name": "society", "path": "/society"}, {"id": 65, "name": "religion", "path": "/religion"}, {"id": 61, "name": "politics", "path": "/politics"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 1194, "name": "LG17, The Faculty of Law", "slug": "lg17-the-faculty-of-law", "city": "Cambridge", "postcode": "CB3 9DZ"}, "organizer": {"id": 1307, "name": "Institute of Criminology", "slug": "institute-of-criminology"}, "date": "2007-04-16", "dates": [{"id": 4367, "from_date": "2007-04-16", "to_date": "2007-04-16", "time": "17:00:00", "ticket_cost": "Free Admission", "ticket_info": null, "additional_info": "Parking is limited around the campus.

This view of bacteria is certainly not true of soil-living Streptomyces bacteria: although their spores are tiny, they grow into multicellular organisms easily visible without a microscope; and they are extremely useful to us. Their usefulness comes from their amazing virtuosity as chemists - as they make many of the antibiotics that we use to treat disease. Many species of Streptomyces have been captured by the pharmaceutical industry and bred for this purpose. Previously, we could describe these marvellous bacteria mainly in terms of what we could see or detect from the outside. In this lecture, Keith Chater will present a new view of them, made possible by their complete genomes.
