Critical Thinking is an apolitical, collaborative research and education project that analyses the current political economy to identify fundamental flaws and potential levers for change. The organisation aims to understand the historical context of issues from different perspectives and their current and future impacts on social cohesion, inequality, individual liberty and civilisation as we know it. Critical Thinking has developed a unified theory of political economy and has formulated a prescription for action to create a freer, fairer world.

Thus began a relationship with the Trust which has stretched nearly seventy\r\n\r\nyears. Tam and his wife, Kathleen, who manages the house on behalf of the Trust, continue to live at the Binns today.\r\n\r\n\r\nYoung Tam Dalyell showed a high-mindedness which marked him out in his ensuing political career. After Eton, National Service with the Royal Scot Greys,\r\n\r\nfounded by his ancestor General Tam Dalyell, and Cambridge, he became a teacher before being elected to Parliament in 1962 as the Labour candidate for\r\n\r\nWest Lothian. His next 43 years ensured - given his vehemently independent views - that his name was rarely out of the headlines. \r\n\r\n\r\nA critic of both Margaret Thatcher and Tony Blair, he famously harried the former during the Falklands War and argued fiercely with the latter over the Gulf War and the invasion of Iraq.

O’Rourke’s discusses her book, which captures the paradox of grief – its monumental agony and its surprising, small intimacies.\r\n\r\nEverything You Always Wanted to Know About Funerals (but Were Afraid to Ask) \r\nThe family of 22 year old Josh Harris-Edmonds, who died in 2011,are joined by Charles Cowling of the Good Funeral Guide, and funeral directors including Chandu Tailor who specialises in Hindu and Sikh funerals. The panel, chaired by Lucy Neal, will dispel common funeral myths and show the different ways that funerals can help with grief, and show ‘Beyond Goodbye’ - a trailer for the film documenting Josh’s funeral.\r\n\r\nWhose Life is it Anyway? \r\nAssisted Dying - the Human Rights Debate \r\nJon Snow chairs a debate on one of the UK’s most controversial issues – assisted dying. Suicide has been legal in the UK since 1961, but it’s a criminal offence to help someone to do it. A panel including human rights lawyer Baroness Helena Kennedy QC discuss some of the moral and legal challenges of normalising assisted suicide.", "additional_info": null, "duration": 480, "image_id": null, "added": "2011-12-22T10:29:39", "slug": "be0685de2cd1e220", "speakers": [{"id": 1527, "name": "Mr Jon Snow", "slug": "mr-jon-snow"}], "topics": [{"id": 1891, "name": "literature", "path": "/arts/literature/19thcentury/literature"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 1631, "name": "Southbank Centre", "slug": "southbank-centre", "city": "London", "postcode": "SE1 8XX"}, "organizer": {"id": 1631, "name": "Southbank Centre", "slug": "southbank-centre"}, "date": "2012-01-28", "dates": [{"id": 11084, "from_date": "2012-01-28", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "10:00:00", "ticket_cost": "£12", "ticket_info": "southbankcentre/death\r\n0844 847 9910", "additional_info": null, "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 1631, "name": "Southbank Centre", "slug": "southbank-centre", "city": "London", "postcode": "SE1 8XX"}, "organizer": {"id": 1631, "name": "Southbank Centre", "slug": "southbank-centre"}}]}, {"id": 10531, "title": "Addiction:  Understanding how to stop addictive behaviour", "synopsis": "Why the human givens approach gives us a more comprehensive model for understanding various aspects of addictive behaviour.", "keywords": "alcoholism\r\ndrug abuse\r\neating disorders\r\ngambling\r\ncompulsions\r\naddiction\r\nhealth and social services\r\naddictive behaviour\r\npsychotherapy\r\nbrain science\r\nbrain\r\neffective strategies\r\naddictive patterns\r\naddictive behaviour\r\nsubstance abuse\r\ndrug abuse\r\ncompulsive eating\r\nanorexia\r\nbulimia\r\n", "body": "Discover how you can be more effective when working with alcoholism, drug abuse, eating disorders, gambling, sexual obsessions and other compulsions.

But over the past 150 years there have been dramatic increases in all three values. Professor Herbert Huppert, the Director of the Institute of Theoretical Geophysics at the University of Cambridge, will explore this rise and its probable significance, as well as one option that can potentially halt the rise in CO2 - carbon storage.\r\n\r\nThis technology may combat the rise in greenhouse gases by storing CO2 in vast porous geological formations.  For the last fifteen years there has been considerable effort devoted to storing, or sequestering, some of the millions of tons of CO2 resulting from the burning of fossil fuels which otherwise would have been emitted into the atmosphere.  The first project, the Sleipner gas field off Norway’s coast, has successfully stored approximately 15 million tons of CO2 since 1996.  This lecture will explore some of the physical, chemical and fluid dynamical processes in the storage of CO2, as well as evaluate the risk of leakage back into the atmosphere. \r\n\r\nMore information is available at: http://royalsociety.org/events/Bakerian2011/\r\n\r\nThis event will be broadcast live on the web at royalsociety.org/live and available to view on demand within 48 hours of delivery.\r\n\r\nVisit our video archive at royalsociety.tv\r\n\r\nThe Bakerian Lecture is the Society's premier lecture in the physical sciences.

Thus Joseph's heirs are not only Margaret Thatcher and Nigel Lawson, but also Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. Indeed, the world we live in is one largely created by Keith Joseph, and we will probably continue to live in it for a very long time to come.\r\n\r\nVERNON BOGDANOR CBE is Professor of Government at Oxford University, and a Visiting Professor of Constitutional History at King’s College, London.

He received a Diploma of Architecture with Distinction from Leicester Polytechnic and later received an Honorary Doctor of Design from De Montfort University in recognition of his outstanding achievements in his career.\r\n \r\nKen Shuttleworth is the founder of Make architects. Founded in 2004, this studio of highly creative architects and designers is committed to designing buildings, spaces and places which are as striking and innovative as they are socially, economically and environmentally responsible and has already established itself as one of the UK’s foremost architectural firms. \r\n\r\nMake’s first building, the award-winning Dartford Dojo, was completed in 2006, while recently-completed projects include the St Paul’s Information Centre in the City of London and the 55 Baker Street office development in central London. Schemes now under construction include The Cube in Birmingham and two new residential buildings within the Grosvenor Waterside development in London. Other major projects currently underway worldwide range from product design to urban masterplans, embracing office, residential, healthcare, sport and civic buildings of all scales. \r\n\r\nPrior to founding Make, Ken was a Partner at Foster and Partners, where he worked on some of the most iconic and ground-breaking buildings in the world.   He joined the practice in 1977, moving to Hong Kong in 1979 to oversee the design and construction of the Hongkong Shanghai Bank. Returning to the UK in 1986, he proceeded to build up a remarkable portfolio of experience over the following decades.  The projects he worked on during this time include the Carré d’Art in Nîmes, the ITN building in London, Cranfield University Library, Hong Kong’s Chek Lap Kok airport, the Al Faisaliah development in Riyadh, the Millennium Bridge in London, 30 St Mary Axe (the Swiss Re tower, also know as the London Gerkin) in the City of London and London’s City Hall. \r\n\r\nKen was appointed a CABE Commissioner in 2002 and in 2004 was made a Chair of the CABE Design Review panel.

Directors work with playwrights, producers work with directors and playwrights work with producers – apart from everybody else involved in a play. It is nearly inevitable to share and develop ideas with others during the production of a play or a West end show. But who will own the copyright in the end product and ultimately can exploit their rights when the show is a success? This seminar will help you to avoid pitfalls and future disputes by guiding you through certain rules and the legal framework of collaboration in the theatre.\r\n\r\nJust imagine you are a director and have an idea for a play. Unfortunately, you can’t write and would need to work with a playwright to develop your idea. Or you are a playwright and have to find a producer, who is prepared to put your play on stage. How do you work out an agreement that is beneficial to both of you and ensures that you don’t lose out when the play is successful. Or you are a producer and have worked with a director and playwright on a very popular musical – several other producers are now interested in taking the show around the world. In these and many other situations it is wise to be aware of your rights and what’s good practice when collaborating.  \r\n\r\nOwn-it and Stellar Network have invited a legal expert and representatives of two productions who will give you invaluable advice and answer your questions.\r\n\r\nSpeakers include:\r\n\r\nHarry Karaolou - LG LLP Harry specialises in all aspects of intellectual property law.

Harry also conducts brand protection work for multinational clients within various industries.

Recovery of war torn communities is a long and fraught process and depends integrally on measures in place to restore civil, political, economic and social rights. In UNHCR's experience, there is a direct link between return and restoration of the rights of displaced populations, and the consolidation of peace. Where peace processes ignore root causes of displacement and relegate return of the displaced to the realm of logistics, not rights, peace seldom lasts. The United Nations reform process has opened up new prospects for greater synergies between agencies with protection mandates and the mandates of peace missions.\r\n\r\nErika Feller is assistant high commissioner for protection in the United Nations High Commission for Refugees. It carries the level of UN Assistant Secretary General. Her professional career, now spanning 34 years, has had a predominantly international law focus. It has included 14 years and three international postings with the Australian Diplomatic Service, followed by 20 years of progressively more senior appointments with the UN, working predominantly with the theory and the practice of international human rights and refugee law. Ms Feller has served for UNHCR in Geneva, but also as the Representative in Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei. Concurrently with this position, she was appointed Regional Coordinator for Status Determination under the Comprehensive Plan of Action to resolve the Indo-Chinese Refugee problem. \r\n\r\nMs Feller has travelled extensively, thoughout Africa, Asia, Europe and North America, for the purposes of negotiations with Governments on their asylum policies and practices. She was the initiator and manager of the 2001-2 Global Consultations on International Protection, which generated the Agenda for Protection, the internationally endorsed global \"road map\" on protection policy for the years ahead. Her job has had her running refugee camps and undertaking protection oversight missions to the large majority of the major refugee emergencies of recent years, for example in West Africa, Darfur and Chad, the Caucusus, the Balkans, Colombia or Timor.  In her current position, Ms Feller's responsibilities include oversight of age, gender and diversity mainstreaming and accountability in UNHCR programs.

Being in a good mood can lift your day, while bad moods make you feel like the whole world is against you. So a positive frame of mind is pretty desirable – we all know someone who’s eternally cheerful and sometimes wish we could be more like them. But is this ‘glass-half-full’ attitude genetic? \r\n\r\nThe idea of genes altering mood may sound like a strange concept. Surely our genetics are fixed? But the way our genes are expressed changes over time. Genes affect and regulate moods by controlling the production of chemicals in the brain. For example, hormones are controlled by genes, and the production of different hormones varies through life and even over the course of a day. Scientists are starting to discover how genes can contribute to mood disorders such as bipolar disorder and depression. There is also the emerging field of ‘positive psychology,’ where research focuses on the biological, social and environmental factors that contribute to our sense of well-being. \r\n\r\nSo whether you’ve got a sunny disposition or a grey and gloomy one, you can find out more about moods, emotions and genes at this Dana Centre/IoP event.

This lecture will explore the state of our resources, the challenges anticipated over the planning period and the strategic principles which will need to underpin such a long term strategy.\r\nProgress to date has started to polarise some of the key challenges faced by the proper use of water resources under an overarching agenda of sustainable development.  The demand for water is set to grow, both as a function of demographics but more significantly due to rising per capita consumption.  Not only is our use of water one of the highest in Europe but whilst per capita consumption across Europe is set to reduce still further, ours is forecast to continue its upwards rise.  Other key challenges include defining future levels of abstraction, consistent with the principles of sustainable development against a backdrop of new environmental imperatives and climate change.  Wider issues to also be covered will include the future role of the water sector within the carbon agenda and the mix of demand management and new resources to meet future challenges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 120, "image_id": null, "added": "2006-12-01T00:57:49", "slug": "conservation-and-sustainability-balancing-water-resources-principles-of-sustainable-development", "speakers": [{"id": 4771, "name": "Trevor Bishop", "slug": "trevor-bishop"}], "topics": [{"id": 1001, "name": "sustainability", "path": "/science/biology/sustainability/sustainability"}, {"id": 868, "name": "climate", "path": "/science/climatechange/climate"}, {"id": 158, "name": "sustainability", "path": "/science/biology/sustainability"}, {"id": 752, "name": "conservation", "path": "/science/naturalhistory/conservation"}], "supercategory": "science", "venue": {"id": 1212, "name": "Birkbeck, University of London", "slug": "birkbeck-university-of-london", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC1H 0PD"}, "organizer": {"id": 1069, "name": "Ecology and Conservation Studies Society", "slug": "ecology-and-conservation-studies-society"}, "date": "2007-02-23", "dates": [{"id": 3934, "from_date": "2007-02-23", "to_date": "2007-02-23", "time": "18:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": null, "additional_info": "For any queries, please contact e-mail:   wright@britishlibrary.net;  tel:  020 7485 7903,\r\n   or contact e-mail:   h.atkinson@bbk.ac.uk ;  tel:  020 7679 1069", "members_only": "No", "members_info": "Details of the Society and application forms will be available at the door, and are on our website http://www.bbk.ac.uk/ce/environment/   [follow the link]", "venue": {"id": 1212, "name": "Birkbeck, University of London", "slug": "birkbeck-university-of-london", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC1H 0PD"}, "organizer": {"id": 1069, "name": "Ecology and Conservation Studies Society", "slug": "ecology-and-conservation-studies-society"}}]}, {"id": 3534, "title": "Life & Death in Roman Chester", "synopsis": "The hidden story behind Chester's Roman tombstones", "keywords": "History", "body": null, "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": null, "added": "2006-10-04T00:03:28", "slug": "life-death-in-roman-chester", "speakers": [{"id": 4483, "name": "Mr Dan Robinson", "slug": "mr-dan-robinson"}], "topics": [{"id": 106, "name": "wwi", "path": "/arts/books/history/military/wwi"}, {"id": 107, "name": "wwii", "path": "/arts/books/history/military/wwii"}, {"id": 108, "name": "army", "path": "/arts/books/history/military/army"}, {"id": 109, "name": "navy", "path": "/arts/books/history/military/navy"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 331, "name": "Grosvenor Museum", "slug": "grosvenor-museum", "city": "Chester", "postcode": "CH1 2DD"}, "organizer": {"id": 331, "name": "Grosvenor Museum", "slug": "grosvenor-museum"}, "date": "2007-04-19", "dates": [{"id": 3693, "from_date": "2007-04-19", "to_date": "2007-04-19", "time": "19:30:00", "ticket_cost": "as above", "ticket_info": "At the door", "additional_info": null, "members_only": "No", "members_info": "Grosvenor Museum Society Subscription £10.
