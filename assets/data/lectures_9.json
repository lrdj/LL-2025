The first part of the talk is about how wildlife art has changed through the years and how it relates to wildlife conservation. The second part is about her own work, the practicalities of creating images inspired by the natural world and the importance of fieldwork.\r\n\r\nJackie Garner is a professional wildlife artist with her work held in collections in Norway, South Africa, Trinidad and Australia, and has been shown on BBC television. She is the author and main illustrator of The Wildlife Artist's Handbook (The Crowood Press, 2013). Jackie originally concentrated solely on British wildlife art, but four weeks in the Falkland Islands in 2005 led to a reputation for penguin paintings. In 2008 she spent six weeks on a research trip in Egypt which will be the basis of illustrations for a book on the wildlife art of ancient Egypt.\r\n\r\nJoint event with the Marylebone Birdwatching Society www.birdsmbs.org.uk. \r\nFri 12 April 2019 at 7.15pm (doors open at 7.00pm).

The Ednams became a dynamic couple of the Bright Young Things era of the 1920s, but in July, 1930 at the peak of their chaotic life together, Rosemary met her sudden death in a horrific aeroplane crash, which also killed three of her fellow aristocrats.  The cause of the crash still remains a mystery.   The Prince of Wales was supposed to have been on the same flight, but changed his plans at the last minute.   A largely untold Society tale that raises disturbing issues, even now, over eighty years later.  \r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 120, "image_id": 2181, "added": "2015-02-05T11:21:28", "slug": "127dcdb6f2347915", "speakers": [{"id": 13766, "name": "Mr William  Cross", "slug": "mr-william-cross"}], "topics": [{"id": 3233, "name": "prince", "path": "/arts/music/popular/prince"}, {"id": 1479, "name": "women", "path": "/religion/judaism/jewishidentity/women"}, {"id": 2344, "name": "women", "path": "/society/law/international/women"}, {"id": 2428, "name": "women", "path": "/academic/politics/greatbritain/women"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 3150, "name": "Risca U3A at Youth Centre", "slug": "risca-u3a-at-youth-centre", "city": "Risca", "postcode": "NP11 6AT"}, "organizer": {"id": 2861, "name": "William Cross, FSA Scot", "slug": "william-cross-fsa-scot"}, "date": "2015-03-24", "dates": [{"id": 14979, "from_date": "2015-03-24", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "1 day, 0:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Members and Guests", "ticket_info": "Please enquire of the membership secretary, Risca U3A.", "additional_info": "Will Cross is currently working on a book \"Rosemary and Alistair: 'Everything is More Beautiful Because We're Doomed' \" all about Rosemary Leveson Gower and her brother Alistair ( who also died mysteriously).

As the West lies battered by financial crises, Africa is seen as offering limitless opportunities for wealth creation in the march of globalisation.

Drawing on philosophy, economics and strategy, he ranges from capitalism to technological innovation, finance to foreign investment, and from human capital to world trade to offer a new vision of transformation.

Given the present state of confusion concerning the world’s economy and financial systems, beginning with capitalism and the global meltdown, the publication of a work that clarifies the meanings of wealth and poverty couldn’t be more timely.\r\n\r\nDr. DeLorenzos edition and translation of Kitab al-Masakin (The Destitute) by Mustafa Sadiq al-Rafi'i brings us, for the first time, a careful edition of this almost forgotten work of early 20th century Arabic literature, along with an outstanding translation into English on facing pages. DeLorenzos translation captures the essence of the meaning of the original text while giving the reader a flavor of al-Rafi'is literary style.\r\n\r\nA scholar of Islamic Transactional Law, Sheikh Yusuf works with international financial entities, including institutional investors, home finance providers, international investment banks, asset managers and governments.\r\n\r\nSheikh Yusuf is the author of the three volume Compendium of Legal Opinions on the Operations of Islamic Banks, the first English/Arabic reference on the fatawa issued by Shari'ah boards. In addition, Sheikh Yusuf wrote the introduction to Islamic Bonds, the 2003 book that introduced Sukuk and transformed the world's Islamic capital markets. His work has appeared in academic and industry journals and as chapters in books, including Euromoney's Islamic Asset Management (2004), Islamic Retail Finance (2005), and Islamic Finance: Innovation & Growth (2002).

And why is it so slow to recover?  In THE FLAW Sundance award-winning documentary filmmaker David Sington sets out to find the answer. \r\n\r\nTalking to some of the world's leading economists, such as the housing expert Robert Shiller, Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz, and economic historian Louis Hyman, as well as Wall Street insiders and victims of the crash such as Ed Andrews, a former economics correspondent of the New York Times who nevertheless found himself facing foreclosure and Andrew Luan, once a bond trader, now a Wall Street tour guide, the film presents a highly original and but compelling account of the forces that almost destroyed the world economy. \r\n\r\nUsing cartoons, some truly astonishing graphs and a generous dose of black humour, the film shows how the intellectual ascendancy of an idea – that markets are wiser than individuals – led to policies that changed the way the American economy works, creating a vastly profitable financial sector that in turn drove a massive upwards redistribution of US income.  This created the conditions for a housing bubble that still threatens to pauperize whole sections of the American middle class.  A system that had once raised living standards for the whole population had become a game where 1% win, and 90% lose. The film argues that we won't solve our problems until we recognize that a reasonably equitable division of the spoils of capitalism is essential to its smooth functioning. \r\n\r\nTHE FLAW tells the untold story of the financial credit bubble which caused the financial crash. With testimony from bankers, borrowers, brokers and some of the best economics brains in the world, the film challenges easy assumptions about this being simply a tale of greedy bankers and poor regulation. With the imaginative use of archive, harrowing personal stories and gripping graphics, the film shows how excessive income inequality in society leads to economic instability. \r\n\r\nThe film is the definitive account of the roots, in the USA of the biggest economic crisis to hit the world since the 1930s – a crisis which is causing suffering to many millions of people.  At a time when economic theory and public policy is being re-examined this film is an important intervention in that debate, with some sobering lessons for the future. \r\n\r\nThe screening will be followed by a panel discussion with: \r\n\r\nProfessor Francesco Caselli is the Director of Macroeconics Program in the Centre for Economic Performance and Professor of Economics in the Department of Economics here at LSE. \r\n\r\nPhilip Coggan is the Buttonwood columnist of The Economist.

The results are even being explored by policy wonks. So why does so much of it – work less, say thanks, keep fit – sound so trite? If it were that easy, wouldn’t we all be happy by now? The reason is that a central and tricky question is being glossed over:  just what is happiness? Moreover, how you try to promote happiness depends entirely on what you take happiness to be – and there’s a  wealth of choice in that. The sadness is that this has all been considered before, though there seems to be widespread ignorance of the fact. It was Jeremy Bentham who set up the greatest happiness principle and in the very next generation, his godson and prodigy, John Stuart Mill, who ditched it. What Bentham hadn’t grasped is that if you go for happiness head on, you won’t find it. Happiness is a byproduct of life, not an organising principle. From this follows a devastating critique of the so-called measures of happiness: they rest on assessing the pleasure people experience, but of course life is far more than an increase of pleasure. A rich life of necessity will also include pain, perhaps very great pain. It’s also clear that there are no objective measures of happiness, but only correlations: brain scans rest first on what people say, to which the scan is linked, and what people say depends greatly on what you ask them in the first place. This is why other economists interested in wellbeing say the measures of happiness used today are far too immature to be used in policy decisions. The new science of happiness is actually doing us a profound disservice. Therein lies its failure.\r\n\r\nMark Vernon is a writer and journalist, recent books including The Philosophy of Friendship (Palgrave Macmillan), After Atheism (Palgrave Macmillan) and Wellbeing (Acumen).

Finally, it explores how Diski manipulates both the memoir (a search for the truth about a remembered past—however debated the term “truth” has become in the postmodern world) and the travel book (an exploration of place) by withholding and deferring the reader’s knowledge of each aspect of her text.

As the year unfolded, radical politics and avant garde art seemed to go hand-in-hand. In 2008 London’s South Bank Centre hosted an exhibition of the street posters of Paris from May 68. This innovative, political work took its inspiration from the avant garde traditions of the 19th century Parisian Salon des Refusés, and later experimental art that pushed the boundaries of ‘bourgeois’ form. \r\n\r\n40 years on, many artists are seen as cutting-edge and politically radical, but the context has changed. Modernism has been usurped by postmodernism, and the idea of subverting form is so commonplace that many art-lovers long for assured technique. Meanwhile, culture mandarins practically demand the arts demonstrate their social relevance, and ‘bourgeois’ institutions eschew ‘art for art’s sake’, preferring the politically-oriented work of Mark Wallinger or Banksy.\r\n\r\nHas avant garde art gone mainstream? If so, has it lost its edge? What does it mean for art to be political at a time when politics itself is so uninspiring? Some critics condemn what they see as the vacuousness of ever more outlandish attempts to create art sensation for the sake of it. Are they simply retreating to nostalgia for past excellence, or should we demand art that is genuinely fresh and innovative, whether it’s political or not?

Contemporary warfare is increasingly conducted within real as well as imaginary urban settings, through the destruction, construction, reorganization, and subversion of space. As such, the urban environment is understood by military strategists today not simply as the backdrop for conflict, but as a central element to be studied, manipulated, and created. \r\n\r\nEyal Weizman is an architect, writer, and curator whose work is motivated by a commitment to human rights at a time of increasingly fortified and militarized cities. His studies of violations of international humanitarian law through the use of architecture and planning were published in the report Land Grab, developed in collaboration with the human rights organization B'Tselem. Based on this research, he co-curated A Civilian Occupation: The Politics of Israeli Architecture, which was shown at the Storefront for Art and Architecture, New York, in 2003, and co-edited the accompanying publication. Weizman is founding director of the Centre for Research Architecture at Goldsmiths College, University of London. \r\n\r\nConceived in homage to architect James Stirling, who believed that urban design is integral to the practice of architecture and a vital topic for public debate, the James Stirling Memorial Lectures on the City competition was inaugurated in November 2003 as a unique forum for the advancement of new critical perspectives on the role of urban design and urban architecture in the development of cities worldwide.

Informing the public has not led to involvement, nor even to an overwhelming interest in the news programmes that have provided such information. \r\n\r\nThe time has come for journalism to abandon the myths and stop looking for the fault in itself.

This phenomenon, called political nomadism in several countries, strikes at the very roots of the parliamentary order, such as the party and electoral system, cabinet government etc. While such political nomadism may be dismissed, within a conventional discourse, as an example of the distortions that have crept into democratic practice as it takes root outside the West (the problem of identifying the standard from which deviations can be measured comes in here) within a subaltern discourse it may be seen as perfectly acceptable as democracy itself gets democratised. This challenge of the relationship between the fence and the field requires the attention of political theorists on at least three issues: (i) on the idea of ‘representation’, on what is entailed by it and when can one say that an impermissible departure has taken place, (ii) on the effectiveness of institutions to discipline political behaviour and produce in such behaviour the commitment to the values of the institution, and (iii) on the issue of political judgement in an ethically plural democracy, one that is so necessary to take the democratic transformation of these societies forward. \r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 150, "image_id": null, "added": "2005-05-17T21:56:10", "slug": "f1ec136480e8e40e", "speakers": [{"id": 2485, "name": "Professor Peter Ronald deSouza", "slug": "professor-peter-ronald-desouza"}], "topics": [{"id": 278, "name": "india", "path": "/arts/historyofart/india"}, {"id": 585, "name": "india", "path": "/academic/history/india"}, {"id": 586, "name": "india", "path": "/academic/empire/india"}, {"id": 527, "name": "politics", "path": "/politics/local/politics"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 513, "name": "Centre for the Study of Democracy", "slug": "centre-for-the-study-of-democracy", "city": "London", "postcode": "W1T 3UW"}, "organizer": {"id": 513, "name": "Centre for the Study of Democracy", "slug": "centre-for-the-study-of-democracy"}, "date": "2005-06-21", "dates": [{"id": 2011, "from_date": "2005-06-21", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "18:00:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": null, "additional_info": "For further details, please contact the Democracy Club at democracy-club@wmin.ac.uk \r\n", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 513, "name": "Centre for the Study of Democracy", "slug": "centre-for-the-study-of-democracy", "city": "London", "postcode": "W1T 3UW"}, "organizer": {"id": 513, "name": "Centre for the Study of Democracy", "slug": "centre-for-the-study-of-democracy"}}]}, {"id": 1906, "title": "Jung Chang Discussion", "synopsis": "Jung Chang will be discussing her groundbreaking biography of Mao.", "keywords": "Leisure", "body": "Jung Chang, the author of 'Wild Swans' will be discussing her groundbreaking biography of Mao, 'Mao: The Unknown Story', the enigmatic leader who dominated Chinese politics in the twentieth century.", "additional_info": null, "duration": 120, "image_id": 360, "added": "2005-05-09T15:40:03", "slug": "58de833ee5dd644c", "speakers": [{"id": 988, "name": "Jung Chang", "slug": "jung-chang"}], "topics": [{"id": 80, "name": "society", "path": "/society"}, {"id": 132, "name": "reading", "path": "/leisure/reading"}, {"id": 61, "name": "politics", "path": "/politics"}], "supercategory": "society", "venue": {"id": 171, "name": "Oxford University Museum of Natural History", "slug": "oxford-university-museum-of-natural-history", "city": "Oxford", "postcode": "OX1 3PW"}, "organizer": {"id": 56, "name": "Waterstone's Booksellers", "slug": "waterstones-booksellers"}, "date": "2005-06-07", "dates": [{"id": 1981, "from_date": "2005-06-07", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "19:00:00", "ticket_cost": "£4.", "ticket_info": "Waterstone's Oxford.
