", "keywords": "18th century European drama; freemasonry; Elizabeth Aldworth; 18th century theatrical history  ", "body": "A tutor in Classics and Ancient History at St Anne's College, Oxford, Matthew has a particular interest in the comedies of Carlo Goldoni (1707 – 1793), whose play A Servant of Two Masters had a successful West End and Broadway revival staring James Corden as One Man, Two Guv’nors in 2011. \r\n\r\nGoldoni's Le donne curiose (1753) is one of a number of dramas of the mid-18th century that respond to the extraordinary growth of freemasonry across Europe and beyond in the years after the foundation of the London Grand Lodge in 1717. It demonstrates a close affinity with Pierre Clément's Les fri-maçons (Paris, 1737) and Francesco Griselini's I liberi muratori (Venice, 1754). This talk examines how Goldoni's play introduces key features of masonic practice and discourse and examines how both his and Griselini's work exploit the masons' identification of their order as a continuation of ancient mystery cult. The discovery trope in enlightenment drama may originate from the initiation and passing of Elizabeth St. Leger (later Aldworth) in Doneraile Lodge, No. 44, Doneraile, Ireland in c.1712, after she was found observing a meeting.\r\n\r\nMatthew’s recent publications include Comedy and the Rise of Rome (Oxford, 2004) and From Polypragmon to Curiosus. Ancient Concepts of Curious and Meddlesome Behaviour (Oxford, 2013). \r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 2716, "added": "2018-04-17T21:55:16", "slug": "45fe3ce0a8f67353", "speakers": [{"id": 16760, "name": "Professor  Matthew  Leigh", "slug": "professor-matthew-leigh"}], "topics": [{"id": 277, "name": "18thcentury", "path": "/arts/history/18thcentury"}, {"id": 536, "name": "performingarts", "path": "/arts/theatre/performingarts"}, {"id": 80, "name": "society", "path": "/society"}, {"id": 1756, "name": "theatreproduction", "path": "/arts/theatre/theatreproduction"}, {"id": 931, "name": "theatrehistory", "path": "/arts/history/theatrehistory"}, {"id": 1551, "name": "gender", "path": "/society/gender"}, {"id": 3936, "name": "georgian", "path": "/society/georgian"}, {"id": 3283, "name": "literature", "path": "/society/literature"}, {"id": 542, "name": "women", "path": "/society/women"}, {"id": 927, "name": "drama", "path": "/leisure/drama"}, {"id": 927, "name": "drama", "path": "/leisure/drama"}, {"id": 1928, "name": "culture", "path": "/academic/culture"}, {"id": 3120, "name": "europe", "path": "/academic/europe"}, {"id": 349, "name": "history", "path": "/academic/history"}, {"id": 718, "name": "literature", "path": "/academic/literature"}, {"id": 4442, "name": "freemasonry", "path": "/society/freemasonry"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 3430, "name": "Library and Museum of Freemasonry", "slug": "library-and-museum-of-freemasonry", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC2B 5AZ"}, "organizer": {"id": 3430, "name": "Library and Museum of Freemasonry", "slug": "library-and-museum-of-freemasonry"}, "date": "2018-05-09", "dates": [{"id": 16683, "from_date": "2018-05-09", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "18:00:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": "https://freemasonrymuseum.eventbrite.co.uk", "additional_info": "This is a free event but tickets must be obtained via Eventbrite", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 3430, "name": "Library and Museum of Freemasonry", "slug": "library-and-museum-of-freemasonry", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC2B 5AZ"}, "organizer": {"id": 3430, "name": "Library and Museum of Freemasonry", "slug": "library-and-museum-of-freemasonry"}}]}, {"id": 15782, "title": "HoNovel Detection Methods in Forensics", "synopsis": "New methods for detecting bodily fluids, explosives and illicit drugs", "keywords": "Science, technology, policy, IT", "body": " The new detection methods can be effective in the search for improvised explosives.

First, in 1922, he wooed an American-born beauty named Catherine Wendell and secondly, in 1939, he persuaded the well-known Austrian ballet dancer, turned actress,  Tilly Losch to the altar, well, at least to the Registry Office.   When they married Porchey,  ( who was a life long flirt and sex pest  ) the two women were vulnerable and penniless. Their marital capitulation into the chore of being Porchey’s bed mate was nothing to do with his looks or magnetic sex appeal or of being wonderfully romanced, it was instead all down to acquiring a husband who was better off than they were financially. Socially both women made an impact on many men, they were no angels.  Whilst Porchey made reasonable husband material on grounds of title, money and property neither relationship was a love match and  both women were duped by their family and friends into risking the holy state of matrimony. The marriages proved hell holes for the women.  Porchey was an egotist and regularly unfaithful and cruel. Catherine turned to alcohol and suffered a series of nervous breakdowns. She tried to kill herself.   Tilly  escaped to America after just ten weeks as Highclere’s chatelaine, whilst Porchey lined up his next Countess.   This is the story of how these two women caught in the trap of being Porchey’s wife overcame the abuses, and their own personal tragedies and health scares, to find  inner happiness. Catherine eventually found peace with a man who loved her. Tilly (always the more public and charismatic of Porchey’s wives) became an amateur artist, whilst continuing to ply her trade as one of the iconic symbols of the 20th Century.  \r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 120, "image_id": 1991, "added": "2013-10-28T19:36:48", "slug": "a52671eca97c02e2", "speakers": [{"id": 13766, "name": "Mr William  Cross", "slug": "mr-william-cross"}], "topics": [{"id": 1690, "name": "family", "path": "/society/history/family"}], "supercategory": "society", "venue": {"id": 2941, "name": "Marshfield WI", "slug": "marshfield-wi", "city": "MArshfield", "postcode": "CF3 2UB"}, "organizer": {"id": 2861, "name": "William Cross, FSA Scot", "slug": "william-cross-fsa-scot"}, "date": "2013-11-05", "dates": [{"id": 13639, "from_date": "2013-11-05", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "19:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Members Only", "ticket_info": "Apply to the Secretary of Marshfield Woman's Institute c/o Marshfield Village Hall", "additional_info": "An illustrated talk from William Cross, FSA Scot on his new book Catherine and Tilly, Porchey Carnarvon's Two Duped Wives", "members_only": "Yes", "members_info": "Apply to the Secretary of Marshfield Woman's Institute c/o Marshfield Village Hall", "venue": {"id": 2941, "name": "Marshfield WI", "slug": "marshfield-wi", "city": "MArshfield", "postcode": "CF3 2UB"}, "organizer": {"id": 2861, "name": "William Cross, FSA Scot", "slug": "william-cross-fsa-scot"}}]}, {"id": 12946, "title": "Crowdsourcing a New UK Constitution", "synopsis": "LSE Institute of Public Affairs and Department of Law event, in association with LSE Public Policy Group and LSE Democratic Audit", "keywords": "law, constitution", "body": "The UK has no constitution written down in one document.

It was a misconception that had become evident by the end of Day 1. But, despite the many challenges they faced, 65 days and 18,000km later they’d succeeded in circumnavigating China. In an expedition of extremes, Colin and Ryan visited the third lowest point on Earth and slept at Everest Base Camp beside its highest mountain. They traveled off-road through deep desert sands in suffocating heat, traversed mountain passes in freezing temperatures that turned the moisture in their clothes to ice, and rode in torrential rain through mudslides beside rapidly rising flood waters. At the end of their remarkable journey, the brothers had strengthened the bond between them, gained a Guinness World Record, tested their endurance to its limits, and shared an adventure that most of us will only ever dream of having. In their book The Middle Kingdom Ride, Colin and Ryan take us with them as they travel through the diverse and extraordinary landscapes of China, from its border with North Korea, to the ancient Muslim city of Kashgar, across the vast empty spaces of the Mongolian grasslands, over the mountains and into the monasteries of Tibet.

Even within institutions there is anecdotal evidence that between module teams, certain types of activity are considered by some staff as poor academic practice rather than actual misconduct, which others see as misconduct. External examiner experience shows inconsistency in the approach to dealing with the issue across institutions. This ranges from universities which adopt rigorous detection procedures and follow institutional processes for hearings and application of penalties, to those where less emphasis is placed on formal procedures. For example, the inconsistency across UK law schools is highlighted by research showing that less than 10 per cent of unreferenced text in an essay was considered as a ‘minor’ case of plagiarism at some schools, while it took 50 per cent to be categorized as such at other schools. There is also a lack of information on whether findings of academic misconduct are routinely recorded in student files and the extent to which universities take positive steps to inform the professional bodies of students who are found to cheat. Baroness Ruth Deech, former Head of the Office of the Independent Adjudicator has condemned the ‘indefensible inconsistency’ of punishments imposed on cheating students (THES 2006). In the context of highly regulated career destinations such as the legal or medical professions (and many others) a finding of academic dishonesty can have serious consequences for a student. The focus of this session will be to illustrate the need to raise student awareness of the importance of developing appropriate skills for research and referencing before embarking on a university degree. \r\n\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 1403, "added": "2011-06-06T13:11:15", "slug": "plagiarism-in-higher-education-is-there-a-postcode-lottery", "speakers": [{"id": 11200, "name": "Vera Bermingham", "slug": "vera-bermingham"}], "topics": [{"id": 743, "name": "education", "path": "/academic/arts/linguistics/education"}, {"id": 2192, "name": "assessment", "path": "/academic/education/assessment"}, {"id": 744, "name": "education", "path": "/academic/linguistics/education"}, {"id": 745, "name": "education", "path": "/arts/language/education"}], "supercategory": "academic", "venue": {"id": 2304, "name": "Cambridge Assessment - 9 Hills Road", "slug": "cambridge-assessment-9-hills-road", "city": "Cambridge", "postcode": "CB2 1PB"}, "organizer": {"id": 2297, "name": "Cambridge Assessment Network", "slug": "cambridge-assessment-network"}, "date": "2011-07-06", "dates": [{"id": 10271, "from_date": "2011-07-06", "to_date": "2011-07-06", "time": "15:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Free to attend", "ticket_info": null, "additional_info": "To book a place please contact the Network Team on 01223 553846 or thenetwork@cambridgeassessment.org.uk.", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 2304, "name": "Cambridge Assessment - 9 Hills Road", "slug": "cambridge-assessment-9-hills-road", "city": "Cambridge", "postcode": "CB2 1PB"}, "organizer": {"id": 2297, "name": "Cambridge Assessment Network", "slug": "cambridge-assessment-network"}}]}, {"id": 9841, "title": "Ancient Chorus and Modern Ensembles", "synopsis": "Lucy Jackson explores contemporary approaches to the ‘problem' of the chorus as seen in productions by Katie Mitchell at the National Theatre from 1999 to 2006.

Henri Lefebvre, although expelled from the Situationists, was influenced by them in the perspectives that he developed on cities over many decades. Implicit in their philosophy was the view that cities are neither founded upon, nor satisfy, true human needs. Joseph Boughey will attempt to consider the insights of Lefebvre, Debord and others; citing the work of the philosopher Kate Soper, he will stress that the question of human needs is complex and incapable of simple application to explanation or evaluation. He will attempt to reach preliminary conclusions as to the possible relations between urban environments and human needs, in current and potential societies.\r\n\r\nVenue: Baines Wing Miall Lecture Theatre 2.34, University of Leeds\r\nCampus map of buildings: click on this link, then launch the interactive campus map, and choose Baines Wing from the list on the right.\r\nhttp://www.leeds.ac.uk/timetable/assets/map/index.htm\r\nFrom the main entrance, go straight on past the front desk, then through the doors on the left.

But if one is to examine human thinking and behaviour, some view must be taken, and this applies to the study of religion. This lecture will examine briefly some of the main views of ‘truth’ and see how they apply here. Religion can be regarded as a composite of many different activities, not all of which involve truth claims. A further argument often proposed is that there are different kinds of truth, applicable to different subject matter. A special case is that religion has its own kind of truth with a unique justification.

Many people, he says, will welcome the “freedom to live without fear in an atmosphere of tolerance and respect”. \r\n\r\nIndeed some say restrictions on our liberties should go even further: ex-London Mayor Ken Livingstone has recently argued that “luxuries” such as flying and even eating meat should now be rationed in order to secure our planet from global warming.\r\n\r\n•\tIs Britain “sleepwalking into a surveillance state”, or are our freedoms protected by the Human Rights Act?\r\n•\tIs the concern about the erosion of our liberties limited to a vocal minority of society, with the majority recognising this to be necessary?\r\n•\tIs the reason civil liberties are being curbed just because of the war on terror?\r\n•\tIn the light of the Convention on Modern Liberty, how should we campaign in defence of freedom in the 21st Century?\r\n\r\nVenue: The Ship Pub (Top Floor), Holborn, London WC2A 3HP\r\nPrice: Free - open to all students and young professionals.

The guts of the solution to our local UK problem lie in solving the current major threats of climate change and ecosystem destruction, which exacerbate the world-wide problems of nutrient and toxic pollution, acidification, drainage, engineering damage, and so many invasive species that the world's lakes, rivers and wetlands are vastly changed from what they were only decades ago, let alone in the pre-industrial period.

He has held posts in Malawi, the USA and UK and has taught or carried out research or both on six continents over a period of over forty years.  He is an experimentalist whose current research involves eutrophication, lake restoration and climate change and in addition to the conventional long list of papers in learned journals, he has published a well-known text book on the Ecology of Freshwaters, a New Naturalist book on ‘The Broads’, and a manual for shallow lake restoration.\r\nHe is also much concerned with wider global environmental problems and how art and poetry might be used to get over messages about the environment to the wider public.  He has been President of the British Phycological Society, Vice-president of the British Ecological Society and recently was elected President of the International Association for Limnology.  He was awarded the Association’s Naumann-Thienemann Medal in 2007 for his research and leadership in creating new understanding of shallow lake function.  Despite all this he would want to be remembered as a non-establishment, liberal and liberated iconoclast.\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 120, "image_id": null, "added": "2009-01-24T01:34:34", "slug": "1b0a430259fbc09e", "speakers": [{"id": 8001, "name": "Professor Brian Moss", "slug": "professor-brian-moss"}], "topics": [{"id": 868, "name": "climate", "path": "/science/climatechange/climate"}, {"id": 752, "name": "conservation", "path": "/science/naturalhistory/conservation"}, {"id": 924, "name": "conservation", "path": "/academic/naturalhistory/conservation"}, {"id": 1002, "name": "conservation", "path": "/leisure/conservation/conservation"}], "supercategory": "science", "venue": {"id": 487, "name": "Birkbeck College", "slug": "birkbeck-college", "city": "LONDON", "postcode": "WC1E 7HX"}, "organizer": {"id": 1069, "name": "Ecology and Conservation Studies Society", "slug": "ecology-and-conservation-studies-society"}, "date": "2009-03-20", "dates": [{"id": 6697, "from_date": "2009-03-20", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "18:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": "E-mail: environmentevents@FLL.bbk.ac.uk  for booking and venue details, (telephone  020 7679 1069)", "additional_info": "Booking essential", "members_only": "No", "members_info": "Details of the Society and application forms will be available at the door, and are on our website http://www.bbk.ac.uk/ce/environment/ecssociety/index.shtml", "venue": {"id": 487, "name": "Birkbeck College", "slug": "birkbeck-college", "city": "LONDON", "postcode": "WC1E 7HX"}, "organizer": {"id": 1069, "name": "Ecology and Conservation Studies Society", "slug": "ecology-and-conservation-studies-society"}}]}, {"id": 6346, "title": "A new science of life: Morphic resonance and the habits of nature", "synopsis": "Sheldrake's radical hypothesis implies that the so-called laws of nature are more like habits, and evolution depends on an interplay between habit and creativity.", "keywords": "evolution, memory", "body": "According to Rupert Sheldrake's hypothesis of formative causation, all self-organizing systems, including crystals, animals and societies contain an inherent memory, given by a process called morphic resonance from previous similar systems.

Long fascinated with the inter-relationship between politics and medicine, David Owen uses his deep knowledge of both to undertake a unique study of illness in Heads of Government during the last 100 years. Owen expertly scrutinises such diverse political personalities as Sir Anthony Eden at the time of Suez in 1956; John F. Kennedy and the Bay of Pigs fiasco in 1961; the last Shah of Iran; and President Mitterrand of France who suffered from prostate cancer. Lord Owen also focuses on the \"intoxication of power\" and hubristic behaviour in such leaders as David Lloyd George and Margaret Thatcher and in particular President Bush and Tony Blair. Lord Owen outlines some of the safeguards that society needs to address as a consequence of illness in heads of government.\r\n\r\nDavid Owen was British Foreign Secretary under Prime Minister James Callaghan from 1977 to 1979. He co-founded the Social Democratic Party in 1981 and led it from 1983 to 1990. As EU negotiator, he collaborated with Cyrus Vance, former US Secretary of State, to put forward the Vance-Owen Peace Plan for Bosnia in 1993. He is currently Chancellor of the University of Liverpool and sits as a crossbencher in the House of Lords. Before entering politics, he practiced as a clinical neurologist and psychiatrist at St. Thomas' Hospital in London. He is the author of many books, most recently In Sickness and in Power: illness in heads of government during the last 100 years (Methuen Publishing, April 2008). \r\n\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 732, "added": "2008-09-06T05:14:17", "slug": "f2e88047d047f220", "speakers": [{"id": 7251, "name": "Lord Owen", "slug": "lord-owen"}, {"id": 4522, "name": "Professor Peter Hennessy", "slug": "professor-peter-hennessy"}], "topics": [{"id": 106, "name": "wwi", "path": "/arts/books/history/military/wwi"}, {"id": 107, "name": "wwii", "path": "/arts/books/history/military/wwii"}, {"id": 108, "name": "army", "path": "/arts/books/history/military/army"}, {"id": 109, "name": "navy", "path": "/arts/books/history/military/navy"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 1521, "name": "Old Theatre, London School of Economics & Political Science", "slug": "old-theatre-london-school-of-economics-political-science", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC2A 2AE"}, "organizer": {"id": 1287, "name": "London School of Economics & Political Science", "slug": "london-school-of-economics-political-science"}, "date": "2008-10-27", "dates": [{"id": 6040, "from_date": "2008-10-27", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "18:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": "This event is free and open to all with no ticket required.

The rise of science and religion brought about the exile of Hermeticism from mainstream European thought. It survived through three main channels: Rosicrucianism, Freemasonry and the magical tradition, later re-emerging at the end of the 19th century.

What might not immediately spring to mind is wine, but Old World wine producers are waking up to the fact that the relative newcomers from down under are mounting quite a challenge in the form of world-class tipples from the likes of Cloudy Bay, Cape Mentelle and Green Point wineries. Join Tony, CEO of these three wineries, as he reveals some of the secrets of New World wines, addressing such questions as what do they share with the Old World and what makes them different, what is the meaning and importance of ‘terroir’, and just how and why does a Chardonnay differ from a Shiraz or a still wine from a sparkling wine? Tony will highlight some of the myriad decisions that wine makers are faced with in the quest for the perfect tipple –explaining the production cycle from vineyard to bottle – and how the consequences of the sechoices determine the character of the final product, before letting you see – or should that be ‘taste?’ – for yourself in our wine tasting session.\r\n\r\nAfter an early career as a research scientist in the USA, Tony Jordan (an Australian) became involved in wine as a lecturer in oenology at Charles Stuart University, New South Wales, before establishing the wine making consultancy, Oenotec, which consulted on wine and viticulture to 50 wineries in Australia, New Zealand, USA and France over a ten-year period. Tony was then approached by Moët Hennessy to establish the Green Point winery in the Yarra Valley, Victoria.
