The Prince’s family scoffed at Rosemary’s chequered family pedigree and dismissed the love-weary Prince’s designs, leaving Rosemary, a heroic Red Cross nurse during the Great War, to be swept into marriage by Eric, Viscount Ednam, a close friend of Edward, and heir to an ancient English Earldom. The Ednams became a dynamic couple of the Bright Young Things era of the 1920s, but in July, 1930 at the peak of their chaotic life together, Rosemary met her sudden death in a horrific aeroplane crash, which also killed three of her fellow aristocrats. The unexplained accident (which remains unsolved even today) caused giant ripples across the whole of British Society. Rumours were rife of sabotage, especially as it was said that Edward, Prince of Wales, had only just escaped death in the same crash by changing his travel plans at the last minute. Will Cross (author of several biographies on the British gentry) unravels Rosemary’s life and times and offers some startling and sinister facts about the aftermath of her tragic death. An illustrated talk. Will Cross is working on a book about Rosemary and her brother Alistair ( who also died mysteriously). Both Rosemary and Alastair Leveson-Gower were friends of Gwyneth Morgan, the wayward daughter of Courtenay, Lord Tredegar.

The Prince’s family scoffed at Rosemary’s chequered family pedigree and dismissed the love-weary Prince’s designs, leaving Rosemary, a heroic Red Cross nurse during the Great War, to be swept into marriage by Eric, Viscount Ednam, a close friend of Edward, and heir to an ancient English Earldom. The Ednams became a dynamic couple of the Bright Young Things era of the 1920s, but in July, 1930 at the peak of their chaotic life together, Rosemary met her sudden death in a horrific aeroplane crash, which also killed three of her fellow aristocrats. The unexplained accident (which remains unsolved even today) caused giant ripples across the whole of British Society.  Rumours were rife of sabotage, especially as it was said that Edward, Prince of Wales, had only just escaped death in the same crash by changing his travel plans at the last minute.

What had been a minor regional school achieved international prominence and influenced the future of European art in general for centuries. Central to this achievement was the genius of a succession of painters from Giovanni Bellini and his brother Gentile, Carpaccio, Giorgione, to the great Titian and his younger contemporaries Tintoretto and Veronese. These painters worked in a city undergoing crisis and change: the decline of its maritime empire, the reduction of its monopoly of trade with the East, its near destruction as a state in the early sixteenth century, and the religious turmoil engendered by the Reformation and the reaction of the Roman Church to it. Governed by an oligarchy of merchant nobles who elected a Doge, Venice remained politically stable throughout this turbulent period and continued to flourish economically. The state, the lay confraternities (called scuole) and private individuals provided sufficient patronage and support for a brilliant school of painting to develop in both secular and religious art.

The film and exhibition illustrate the interlinked challenges of climate change, poverty, population expansion, habitat destruction, species extinction, pollution and the wasteful use of resources. Hard Rain brings these global challenges alive in a moving and unforgettable way. \r\n\r\nMore than 15 million people on every continent have viewed it in city centres, botanic gardens, universities, and the headquarters of international organisations such as the UN and IPCC. One of the most successful photographic exhibitions ever created, it has attracted huge public and critical acclaim, along with the support and endorsement of political and environmental leaders across the world.  The exhibition is to be shown at the Rio+20 UN Conference on Sustainable Development in June 2012 which commemorates the 20th anniversary of the Rio Earth Summit. \r\n\r\nWebsite: http://www.hardrainproject.com    \r\n\r\nMark Edwards, over a career spanning 5 decades and 150 countries, is one of the few environmental communicators to have personally witnessed the global issues that are defining the 21st century. In 1985 he founded Still Pictures, the world's leading photo agency specializing in the environment, social issues and nature. The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) added his name to the Global 500 Roll of Honour in 1990, and the Royal Geographic Society awarded him the Cherry Kearton Medal at the Rio Earth Summit in 1992. In 2009 The Royal Photographic Society awarded Mark Edwards and Bob Dylan the Terence Donovan Award for Hard Rain. \r\n\r\nSuggested hashtag for this event for Twitter users: #lserain \r\n\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 732, "added": "2011-12-21T08:43:39", "slug": "6cf9b908db36d02a", "speakers": [{"id": 4909, "name": "Mark Edwards", "slug": "mark-edwards"}], "topics": [{"id": 874, "name": "population", "path": "/society/society/society/population"}, {"id": 868, "name": "climate", "path": "/science/climatechange/climate"}, {"id": 1992, "name": "change", "path": "/politics/economics/change"}, {"id": 2586, "name": "change", "path": "/society/urbanisation/change"}], "supercategory": "society", "venue": {"id": 2223, "name": "Wolfson Theatre", "slug": "wolfson-theatre", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC2A 2AE"}, "organizer": {"id": 1287, "name": "London School of Economics & Political Science", "slug": "london-school-of-economics-political-science"}, "date": "2012-02-09", "dates": [{"id": 11032, "from_date": "2012-02-09", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "18:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": "This event is free and open to all with no ticket required.

Contrary to her fears, politics now seemed like a worthwhile, even noble pursuit. Together they planned a White House life that would be as normal and sane as possible. Then they moved in. In The Obamas, Jodi Kantor takes us deep inside the White House as they grapple with their new roles, change the country, raise children, maintain friendships, and figure out what it means to be President and First Lady. Filled with riveting detail and insight into their partnership and personalities, and written with a keen eye for the ironies of public life and the realities of power, The Obamas is an intimate portrait that will surprise even those who thought they knew the President and First Lady. \r\n\r\nJodi Kantor began her journalism career by dropping out of Harvard Law School to join Slate.com in 1998. Four years later, she became the youngest section editor of The New York Times, taking over and revamping the Arts & Leisure section. She began covering the Obamas for the paper in 2007, writing front-page stories that chronicled their biographies and philosophies, and also writing about Hillary Clinton, Sarah Palin and other major political figures along the way. She is a recipient of the Columbia Young Alumni Achievement Award, she was chosen by Crain's Magazine as one of \"40 Under 40\" New Yorkers, and she appears regularly on American television, including Today and the Charlie Rose Show. \r\n\r\nSuggested hashtag for this event for Twitter users: #lseObamas", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 732, "added": "2011-12-11T22:48:16", "slug": "7568101fd7d84f6d", "speakers": [{"id": 11827, "name": "Jodi Kantor", "slug": "jodi-kantor"}], "topics": [{"id": 2198, "name": "obama", "path": "/politics/unitedstates/presidential/obama"}, {"id": 2722, "name": "politics", "path": "/academic/history/gender/politics"}, {"id": 2561, "name": "marriage", "path": "/society/women/marriage"}, {"id": 527, "name": "politics", "path": "/politics/local/politics"}], "supercategory": "politics", "venue": {"id": 1515, "name": "Old Theatre, Old Building", "slug": "old-theatre-old-building", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC2A 2AE"}, "organizer": {"id": 1287, "name": "London School of Economics & Political Science", "slug": "london-school-of-economics-political-science"}, "date": "2012-01-24", "dates": [{"id": 10970, "from_date": "2012-01-24", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "18:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": "This event is free and open to all with no ticket required.

The School of Life is adding to the heat, by hosting the most vital debate of the day: Red Tory vs Blue Labour. \r\n\r\nWith both Thatcherism and New Labour in disgrace, the ideological cross dressing of the last thirty years has changed and intensified. Cameron’s Conservatives increasingly identify themselves with the National Health Service, educational opportunity and stronger local government. Labour meanwhile remains in thrall to the City of London, while strengthening its policy on Law and Order and presenting itself as the most effective defender of Britishness and the British State. \r\n\r\nSpeaking for the Red Tories is Philip Blond, director of the Progressive Conservatism Project at Demos. He will argue that only a revived Conservative tradition drawing inspiration from Burke, Disraeli, Chesterton and Belloc can challenge inequality, restore a sense of home and place and provide real security for people in times of crisis. Blond's brand of Red Toryism decisively rejects markets pretending to be free when in fact they are private sector monopolies, and far from insisting on a powerful state, argues for power to be restored to local communities. \r\n\r\nWaving the flag for Blue Labour is Maurice Glasman, Director of the Faith and Citizenship Programme at London Metropolitan University and faculty member of The School of Life. Glasman will argue for a deeply conservative socialism that places family, faith and work at the heart of a new politics of reciprocity, mutuality and solidarity. Find out what is really at stake in how the two great political traditions of Britain make sense of the role of finance in civil society. And discover the battleground over which the next general election is sure to be fought. \r\n\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 120, "image_id": null, "added": "2009-03-18T15:06:11", "slug": "red-tory-vs-blue-labour", "speakers": [{"id": 8169, "name": "Philip Blond Philip Blond", "slug": "philip-blond-philip-blond"}, {"id": 8170, "name": "Dr Maurice Glasman", "slug": "dr-maurice-glasman"}], "topics": [{"id": 538, "name": "politics", "path": "/arts/photography/politics"}, {"id": 527, "name": "politics", "path": "/politics/local/politics"}, {"id": 713, "name": "politics", "path": "/society/war/politics"}, {"id": 938, "name": "politics", "path": "/politics/philosophy/politics"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 676, "name": "The Conway Hall", "slug": "the-conway-hall", "city": "London", "postcode": ""}, "organizer": {"id": 1805, "name": "The School of Life", "slug": "the-school-of-life"}, "date": "2009-04-22", "dates": [{"id": 6879, "from_date": "2009-04-22", "to_date": "2009-04-22", "time": "19:00:00", "ticket_cost": "£10", "ticket_info": "To book call 0207 833 1010 \r\n", "additional_info": null, "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 676, "name": "The Conway Hall", "slug": "the-conway-hall", "city": "London", "postcode": ""}, "organizer": {"id": 1805, "name": "The School of Life", "slug": "the-school-of-life"}}]}, {"id": 6495, "title": "LSE public lecture", "synopsis": "The Global Crisis: A Latin American View", "keywords": "latin america", "body": "Cristina Fernández de Kirchner is President of Argentina, a position she has held since December 2007.

Historian Sarah Wise has undertaken close examination of the surviving documentation - memoirs, police and court records, parliamentary papers, the archives of the London County Council and Charles Booth’s notebooks – which allows us to piece together a much more complex picture of life in the Nichol at the end of the 19th century.

She reviews for the Daily Telegraph and The Literary Review.\r\n \r\nMichelle Johansen is an historian and researcher specialising in 19th and 20th century London. She is a Visiting Research Fellow at the Raphael Samuel History Centre.\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 60, "image_id": null, "added": "2008-08-02T09:08:41", "slug": "025881ffb1ab09a9", "speakers": [{"id": 6320, "name": "Dr Sarah Wise", "slug": "dr-sarah-wise"}], "topics": [{"id": 1529, "name": "london", "path": "/society/history/london"}], "supercategory": "society", "venue": {"id": 1487, "name": "Bishopsgate Institute", "slug": "bishopsgate-institute", "city": "London", "postcode": "EC2M 4QH"}, "organizer": {"id": 1487, "name": "Bishopsgate Institute", "slug": "bishopsgate-institute"}, "date": "2008-11-18", "dates": [{"id": 5869, "from_date": "2008-11-18", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "19:30:00", "ticket_cost": "£5, concs £3; advance booking required", "ticket_info": "Call 020 7392 9220 between 9.30am and 5.30pm, Monday to Friday.", "additional_info": "Bishopsgate Institute is two minutes walk from Liverpool Street station.", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 1487, "name": "Bishopsgate Institute", "slug": "bishopsgate-institute", "city": "London", "postcode": "EC2M 4QH"}, "organizer": {"id": 1487, "name": "Bishopsgate Institute", "slug": "bishopsgate-institute"}}]}, {"id": 5543, "title": "Can International Tribunals Deliver Justice?", "synopsis": "John Laughland and Philippe Sands QC discuss chaired by writer and columnist Simon Jenkins", "keywords": "International Tribunals.

He has been active in the field for many years, restoring old buildings in which to live, as well as taking a major role in the campaign to restore the Hackney Empire. He has recently published the first part of his memoirs. Peter Stothard of the Times Literary Supplement, reacted to them as “that rare and uncritical thing – simple bloody marvel”, while the Independent described them as an “effective counterbalance to celebrity self-congratulation”.\r\n\r\nIn his own words “Griff Rhys Jones is known as the presenter of \"Restoration\". A former comedian, now perhaps in need of some attention himself, as well as his television work, he has restored two houses in Suffolk, a farmhouse in Wales and a Robert Adam House in London. In he 1988 converted a chicken plucking machine factory in Clerkenwell, winning the first Geoffrey Gribble award for conservation in Islington. In his spare time he led an aggressive campaign to restore the Hackney Empire in the East End, which is now finished, apart from another million pounds needed to pay for overruns. During all this, he has undoubtedly inadvertently broken most of the tenets of proper conservation, and is interested in education and expertise as a result. Not a professional, Griff recognises that he is a woolly minded aesthete, but over the years he has got his hands dirty and has learned about conservation from personal experience. He is certainly interested in money, finding it, begging for it, distributing it and trying to stop people wasting it. He will be presenting a talk based on his experience as a fund raiser and the man in the falling down street.”\r\n\r\nSAVE is delighted that he is giving our Spring lecture.\r\n\r\nDoors open for the evening with Mr Rhys Jones at 18.15, with the lecture starting at 19.00 prompt.

While the images obtained from mammograms and MRI scans are useful, we can gain a better insight into the workings of the human body by combining these images. Recent increases in computer power have enabled us to do this and we can now build a better picture of certain abnormalities –like cancer, as well as investigate cognitive processes such as perception. We rely on perception – the use of built-in knowledge of the external world – to eliminate ambiguities in the information our eye receives. But to what extent are these perceptual mechanisms innate rather than acquired? Consider the unusual condition of synesthesia, which arises when a gene mutation results in the senses being muddled up causing the tasting of shapes or hearing of colours. Studies of brain images have helped us to pin down the neural locus of this disorder, as well as help us understand just what makes the brain so unique. Professor Sir Michael Brady, (BP Professor of Information Engineering at the University of Oxford) and Professor Ramachandran (Director of the Center for the Brain and Cognition at the University of California) are joint winners of the2005 Henry Dale Prize. They will each be giving a short presentation on their work, as well as raising questions on the future possibilities of interdisciplinary research in their fields.

Recent policies for indigenous education seem to want to dislocate traditional forms of education and local knowledge to the institutional sites of the indigenous school, blurring the distinctions between the two. As the official effort to introduce the indigenous school among indigenous communities in Brazil is framed in terms of a respect for cultural difference, the blurring of the distinction between informal education and formal schooling may have a detrimental effect on indigenous cultures, and may result in exactly the same practices of assimilation to the national culture and hence the elimination rather than the respect for difference aimed at by these policies.

It sounds so straightforward but it is a journey fraught with difficulties. Contrary to what one might imagine, females do not like sperm. They are foreign bodies and potentially dangerous and best kept at a distance, or at least under control. The result of this difference in interests between the sexes has been the evolution of almost unbelievable diversity in sperm size, shape and function across the animal (and plant) kingdom. Understanding the evolutionary forces that design sperm is fundamental to dealing with applied problems, including male reproductive health and assisted conception. Are human sperm counts declining? If so, why and what are the fertility implications of reduced sperm numbers? Who actually gives and who receives sperm? What are implications of donating sperm – is it anonymous – should it always be anonymous? Are there risks to women receiving donated sperm? How confident can you be that a baby fathered by donated sperm will be fit and healthy? \r\n\r\nJoin Allan Pacey, Tim Birkhead and Juliet Tizzard in this discussion to address these and other questions.\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 120, "added": "2004-08-04T12:59:38", "slug": "ae214a0ab7217f01", "speakers": [{"id": 45, "name": "Prof Tim Birkhead", "slug": "prof-tim-birkhead"}, {"id": 1368, "name": "Dr Allan Pacey", "slug": "dr-allan-pacey"}, {"id": 1369, "name": "Dr Juliet Tizzard", "slug": "dr-juliet-tizzard"}], "topics": [{"id": 409, "name": "sex", "path": "/society/history/sex"}, {"id": 147, "name": "brain", "path": "/science/biology/brain"}, {"id": 158, "name": "sustainability", "path": "/science/biology/sustainability"}, {"id": 159, "name": "biodiversity", "path": "/science/biology/biodiversity"}], "supercategory": "society", "venue": {"id": 2, "name": "The Royal Institution of Great Britain", "slug": "the-royal-institution-of-great-britain", "city": "London", "postcode": "W1S 4BS"}, "organizer": {"id": 2, "name": "The Royal Institution of Great Britain", "slug": "the-royal-institution-of-great-britain"}, "date": "2004-10-07", "dates": [{"id": 1172, "from_date": "2004-10-07", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "19:00:00", "ticket_cost": "£8 standard, £5 concessions", "ticket_info": "www.rigb.org\r\n020 7409 2992", "additional_info": "Nearest tube: Green Park", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 2, "name": "The Royal Institution of Great Britain", "slug": "the-royal-institution-of-great-britain", "city": "London", "postcode": "W1S 4BS"}, "organizer": {"id": 2, "name": "The Royal Institution of Great Britain", "slug": "the-royal-institution-of-great-britain"}}]}, {"id": 1119, "title": "Montaigne", "synopsis": "Do the Essais belong to philosophy, the history of ideas, or literature?
