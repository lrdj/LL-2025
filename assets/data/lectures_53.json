They promise to put ordinary voters in control, and sideline the self-serving elites.\r\n\r\nSave Democracy – Abolish Voting sets out to offer an alternative way of managing a democracy that will achieve both of these aims in much more effective, and incorruptible way. It is a proposal that takes the best aspects of representative government while also introducing a much more direct and fair link between the citizen and their own government.\r\n\r\nIt is more than just an attack on the crude binary referendums though. It takes a radical route out of the sterile debate around electoral reform, questioning everything that is popularly thought about how democratic decision-making should be done.\r\n\r\nWe have slipped into the comfortable error of confusing government by electoral politics with popular sovereignty. In a less sophisticated age, it may have been the least-worst version of democracy that was available, but in an age of sophisticated communication and feedback monitoring, this is no longer the case.\r\n\r\nIf anything, politics had gradually turned into a retardant, not an accelerant to democracy. Modern electoral systems evolved in a very uneven way in response to particular political pressures. They were rarely ever deliberately designed to apply any sophisticated democratic logic. Instead, the universal franchise often happened in some token way where, we could all join in the illusion of an equal say in our own governance.\r\n\r\nThat token is a ballot paper that gives us control over only a small part of the decision-making chain (e.g. “a parliament”, or only a part of it in the UK’s case) by choosing from a limited set of options that we think we may want – in advance.\r\n\r\nIt shares control over our government very unevenly and unfairly. If we wanted to design a system in a way that helps wealthy and charismatic people con everyone easily, we could barely design anything better.\r\n\r\nThe book, and this talk, attempts to offer a version of democracy that we would choose now if we were starting to create liberal democracy from scratch, knowing what we know about feedback loops and the democratic flaws that have grown more pronounced as electoral government has evolved.\r\n\r\nSave Democracy – Abolish Voting is a meditation on the nature of democracy in the digital age. It concludes with a proposal – a better alternative to electoral democracy for choosing and directing our government fairly and well.\r\n\r\n—\r\n\r\nPaul Evans is a trade union official working in the TV and Motion Pictures industry.\r\n\r\nSave Democracy – Abolish Voting, (2017) was his first book.

His most recent publication\r\non Blake is an edition in facsimile with introduction and commentary of the\r\nBodleian Library copy of The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, published by\r\nBodleian Library Publications and the University of Chicago Press in 2011.\r\nMichael’s training and research as a printmaker has enabled him to re-create\r\nhow Blake produced his illuminated books.\r\n\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": null, "added": "2013-10-20T17:03:23", "slug": "printing-in-the-infernal-method-william-blakes-method-of-illuminated-printing", "speakers": [{"id": 13778, "name": "Michael  Phillips", "slug": "michael-phillips"}], "topics": [{"id": 131, "name": "authors", "path": "/arts/literature/fiction/british/21stcentury/authors"}, {"id": 130, "name": "21stcentury", "path": "/arts/literature/fiction/british/21stcentury"}, {"id": 1699, "name": "printing", "path": "/arts/printing"}, {"id": 2394, "name": "poetry", "path": "/arts/literature/poetry/poet/poetry"}, {"id": 1902, "name": "prints", "path": "/arts/prints"}, {"id": 1595, "name": "18thcentury", "path": "/arts/literature/18thcentury"}, {"id": 1798, "name": "19thcentury", "path": "/arts/literature/19thcentury"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 2858, "name": "St James's Church, the Meeting Room, the Rectory", "slug": "st-jamess-church-the-meeting-room-the-rectory", "city": "London", "postcode": "W1J 9LL"}, "organizer": {"id": 1354, "name": "Blake Society", "slug": "blake-society"}, "date": "2013-11-11", "dates": [{"id": 13077, "from_date": "2013-11-11", "to_date": "2013-11-11", "time": "19:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Free, donations gratefully accepted", "ticket_info": "N/A", "additional_info": null, "members_only": "No", "members_info": "£20 per year. £10 for student and unwaged", "venue": {"id": 2858, "name": "St James's Church, the Meeting Room, the Rectory", "slug": "st-jamess-church-the-meeting-room-the-rectory", "city": "London", "postcode": "W1J 9LL"}, "organizer": {"id": 1354, "name": "Blake Society", "slug": "blake-society"}}]}, {"id": 12931, "title": "Hogarth and Copyright", "synopsis": "Chloe Wong explores the Hogarth Act, otherwise known as the 1735 Engraver's Copyright Act.", "keywords": "Foundling Hospital, free talk, foundling, foundling museum, Hogarth, Copyright, 18th Century, Art", "body": "Curatorial Trainee Chloe Wong explores Hogarth’s role in the passage of the 1735 Engraver’s Copyright Act, and his struggle to gain recognition for contemporary British artists.

Woven into this is a shrewd, and frequently humorous, critique of the way these events are often misrepresented in mainstream media.\r\n\r\nOne of the author’s fundamental premises in writing these letters was to let journalists know that their work was under scrutiny. As such, the book also speaks to issues of freedom of the press and the space allowed to dissenting voices. The end result is a powerful and unique offering that provides the reader with a sustained argument and narrative from an alternative perspective. The quasi-conversational format that it employs also allows the incredulity and helpless horror at the injustices of the conflict felt by so many to be keenly articulated.\r\n\r\nThe author will be joined by former BBC Middle East Correspondent, Tim Llewellyn and foreign leader writer for the Guardian, David Hearst.

But such an era of continuously rising living standards is an historical anomaly, economist Stephen D. King warns, and the current stagnation of Western economies threatens to reach crisis proportions in the not-so-distant future. Praised for the 'dose of realism' he provided in his book 'Losing Control', King follows up in this volume with a plain-spoken assessment of where the West stands today. It's not just the end of an age of affluence, he shows. We have made promises to ourselves that are only achievable through ongoing economic expansion. The future benefits we expect - pensions, healthcare, and social security, for example - may be larger than tomorrow's resources. And if we reach that point, which promises will be broken and who will lose out? The lessons of history offer compelling evidence that political and social upheaval are often born of economic stagnation. King addresses these lessons with a multifaceted plan that involves painful - but necessary - steps toward a stable and just economic future.\r\n\r\n\r\nStephen King is HSBC’s Group Chief Economist and the Bank’s Global Head of Economics and Asset Allocation research. He is directly responsible for HSBC’s global economic coverage and co-ordinates the research of HSBC economists all over the world.

It also illustrates some recent activities undertaken by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. \r\n\r\nThe appointment of Navanethem Pillay (Navi) as UN High Commissioner for Human Rights was approved by the General Assembly on 28 July 2008 and she assumed her functions on 1st September 2008. On 24 May 2012,  the United Nations General Assembly extended her mandate for a further two years. \r\n\r\nMs Pillay, a South African national, was the first woman to start a law practice in her home province of Natal in 1967. Over the next few years, she acted as a defense attorney for anti-apartheid activists, exposing torture, and helping establish key rights for prisoners on Robben Island. \r\n\r\nShe also worked as a lecturer at the University of KwaZulu-Natal, and later was appointed Vice-President of the Council of the University of Durban Westville. In 1995, after the end of apartheid, Ms. Pillay was appointed as acting judge on the South African High Court, and in the same year was elected by the United Nations General Assembly to be a judge on the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, where she served a total of eight years, the last four (1999-2003) as President. She played a critical role in the ICTR's groundbreaking jurisprudence on rape as genocide, as well as on issues of freedom of speech and hate propaganda. In 2003, she was elected as a judge on the International Criminal Court in the Hague, where she remained until August 2008. \r\n\r\nIn South Africa, as a member of the Women's National Coalition, she contributed to the inclusion of an equality clause in the country’s Constitution that prohibits discrimination on grounds of race, religion and sexual orientation. She co-founded Equality Now, an international women's rights organization, and has been involved with other organizations working on issues relating to children, detainees, victims of torture and of domestic violence, and a range of economic, social and cultural rights. \r\n\r\nMs. Pillay received a BA and a LLB from Natal University South Africa. She also holds a Master of Law and a Doctorate of Juridical Science from Harvard University.

Hiding out in the inaccessible highlands they held strong against foreign incursions of all kinds, and for half a millennium they have remained true to their shamanic pagan origins, embarking on a month-long journey each year, walking back to their original habitat, the desert of Wirikuta, to harvest their holiest sacrament, the psychedelic peyote cactus. \r\n\r\nOn their annual pilgrimage the Huichol also pay homage to their ancient holy mountain in the eastern desert, El Quemado, which is both spiritually endowed and minerally rich, loaded as it is with over a billion dollars worth of silver. The Canadian First Majestic Silver Corp wish to extract the precious minerals therein to plate their own pockets and rob another indigenous group of their rightful spiritual topography, and in the process level over 6,000 hectares of unique virgin wilderness with dynamite and cyanide, destroying native flora and fauna in the process. Peyote, known to have been used by indigenous people in the region for at least 5,000 years, is one of these threatened plants, and if it gets obliterated there for sake of the developed world's rapacity, then so does the spirit of the planet's oldest, most culturally intact psychedelic community. This talk explores the Huichol traditions and current problems, and also discusses recent scientific research into the apparent psi-inducing properties of mescaline, the most psychoactive chemical constituent of peyote. \r\n\r\nDr David Luke directs and curates the Ecology, Cosmos and Consciousness lecture series at the October Gallery, which occasionally zoops off in new and interesting co-creative directions like the Breaking Convention: Multidisciplinary Conference on Psychedelic Consciousness.

The presentation includes a reading of four short stories in English translations, live music and dance, and film clips. \r\n\r\nThis project celebrates the art of storytelling and live reading, the beauty of Tagore’s little gems. The readings are punctuated with appropriate music and songs and film excerpts illustrate the visual potential of these stories. The audience engages with the connections made between the spoken word, song and visual image -a stimulating and sensory experience as offered by the best short stories. \r\n\r\nRabindranath Tagore introduced the short story as a literary genre in Bengali literature. Most of these were written or drawn from his experiences of rural Bengal, when as a boy of 20, he was sent out to supervise the family estates lying on both sides of the mighty river Padma (East Bengal now Bangladesh). He spent many months in a houseboat on the river, met the village folk and soaked in the beauty of the land and riverscape. For a city boy from a crowded family, this was Tagore’s first experience of solitude amidst nature. He heard the boatman’s song and the village baul ( itinerant fakir) which probably sowed the seeds of Sufi philosophy reflected in his songs and poetry. \r\n\r\nThe stories, anthologised in Galpaguccha, claim a place in word literature besides the classics of Chekov, Maupassant and O’Henry. Who can forget the little orphan girl Ratan in Post Master ? Or the tomboy Mrinalini whop transforms into a passionate woman in Samapti? How moving is the unlikely friendship between Mini and the migrant Afghan in Kabuliwallah? Or Mrinal who steps out of her husband’s home never to return in Streer Patra? \r\n\r\nDirector Sangeeta Datta has selected four short stories from her translations. Post Master, Kabuliwallah, Samapti (The Conclusion) and Streer Patra (The Wife’s Letter). All of these have been freely adapted into films by Satyajit Ray, Bimal Roy, Tapan Sinha and Purnendu Patree. \r\n\r\nThis event is presented by BAITHANK UK and supported by The Nehru Centre, Orbit Property Management Ltd, HT & Co Drinks Ltd, Hoesh International Ltd and Alan and Linda Westall.

The company was focused on data, optimization, and analytics and became a pioneer of behavioral targeting. BlueLithium was named one of the top 100 private companies in America three years in a row by AlwaysOn, and in 2006, it received highest honor as Top Innovator of the Year. (Previous winners included Google, Skype, and Salesforce.com.) On September 4th, 2007, Yahoo! announced that it was acquiring BlueLithium for $300 million in cash. \r\n\r\nAfter he completed his role at Yahoo, G signed up with the William Morris Agency. \r\n\r\nG starred on FOX's prime-time network show The Secret Millionaire. He has appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show, Bonnie Hunt, EXTRA, Neil Cavuto, among others, and has been profiled in such publications as The New York Times, Entrepreneur magazine, BusinessWeek, Wall Street Journal, Fortune and The San Francisco Chronicle. He completed his memoir, The Dream which globally released Q4 2008. \r\n\r\nOn January 8, 2009, he was featured on Extra TV as America's Most Eligible Bachelor. In September 2009, Chahal started his third Company, gWallet, a virtual currency platform for social media. \r\n\r\nOn April 29, 2010, Chahal was awarded the Leaders In Management Award and an Honorary Doctorate degree in Commercial Science from Pace University for his career achievements as an entrepreneur. \r\n\r\nThis event is supported by the LSE SU Business Society. \r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 60, "image_id": 732, "added": "2010-09-23T16:13:13", "slug": "99d5f56c0e41e634", "speakers": [{"id": 10296, "name": "Gurbaksh Chahal", "slug": "gurbaksh-chahal"}, {"id": 10297, "name": "Chair: Dr Carsten  Sorensen ", "slug": "chair-dr-carsten-sorensen"}], "topics": [{"id": 826, "name": "business", "path": "/business/training/business"}, {"id": 58, "name": "business", "path": "/music/business"}, {"id": 1039, "name": "business", "path": "/arts/business"}, {"id": 1353, "name": "business", "path": "/science/business"}], "supercategory": "business", "venue": {"id": 2113, "name": "Sheikh Zayed Theatre", "slug": "sheikh-zayed-theatre", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC2A 2AE"}, "organizer": {"id": 1287, "name": "London School of Economics & Political Science", "slug": "london-school-of-economics-political-science"}, "date": "2010-10-11", "dates": [{"id": 9296, "from_date": "2010-10-11", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "18:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": "This event is free and open to all with no ticket required.

There have been many powerful turning points in our collective history and now it seems that we are at the edge of another profound turning point in human civilization. The question is: who will be the innovators, explorers and architects of the future? \r\nThis workshop is designed for individuals who are inspired by the idea that there is a different way to change themselves and the world. Change happens when an individual begins to awaken to a new consciousness, a new way of being. This in turn leads to the impulse to do something quite different in the world. Acting on the principle that inner awakening leads to outer change, the awakened individual starts to want to take an active role in creating a new future and no longer wants a future that repeats the conditionings of the past. Instead, there is a compulsion to create a new horizon of potential and possibility for all rather than simply survive the crises we are facing as a species. The challenges we face demand a new way of understanding who we are and where we are going as a species. We need a new worldview—a new way to make sense of life. In this one-day seminar, Andrew Cohen will guide you through an experience of non-dual awakening and how it can open you to new dimensions. In particular, you will: \r\n\r\n•Learn to identify the evolutionary impulse that seeks to move within you; \r\n•Discover an unbelievable excitement and thrill about life and what it means to open to the life force and to always seek the possibility of the new; \r\n•Begin to live from a place that excites you, turns you on constantly and lights up your heart and mind; and \r\n•Realise that the thrill we feel is not separate from the very impulse that initiated the entire creative process out of nothing fourteen billion years ago. \r\n\r\nIn Andrew Cohen’s teaching of Evolutionary Enlightenment, the most important step for the individual is simply to awaken to the evolutionary impulse and then align his or her own intention with that creative force of the universe. It is not something that any one of us has to manufacture through philosophical or intellectual inquiry. It is the nature of the creative process itself. \r\n\r\nOriginator of Evolutionary Enlightenment, a contemporary spiritual and philosophical teaching, Cohen has mapped a comprehensive framework for the development of our higher human potentials. Central to this teaching is the awakening to an experiential recognition of what Cohen calls the Evolutionary Impulse as the animating life-force within us. By becoming ever more conscious of this force and aligning ourselves to it, we can become powerful instruments for human transformation, starting at the most fundamental level—the level of consciousness itself. \r\n\r\nThe day will include dialogue and meditation. \r\n\r\n  \r\nAndrew Cohen \r\n \r\nAndrew Cohen is an American spiritual teacher whose name is synonymous with a new kind of Enlightenment. His core message is that enlightenment today is not just about the power of now—it’s about the power of the next moment, and the next, and the next. Andrew Cohen is the founder and editor-in chief of the award-winning magazine EnlightenNext, and he has spent the past two decades exploring and redefining the meaning of spiritual awakening in our time. \r\nAndrew Cohen has presented at numerous forums over the years, including the Parliament of World’s Religions (2004, 2009), LOHAS International Conference, International Transpersonal Conference, Integral Leadership in Action, International Conference on the Frontiers of Yoga and Consciousness Research, India, as well as universities, spiritual centers, and business settings around the world. \r\n\r\nAndrew Cohen offers talks, retreats, publications, and ongoing dialogues with the leading philosophers, mystics, and activists of our time. Cohen has eight centers worldwide, including a 220-acre retreat center in Massachusetts and a state-of-the-art “green” center in London, England.He travels extensively each year, lecturing and leading retreats on Evolutionary Enlightenment around the world. He is the author of several books, his latest being Living Enlightenment: A Call for Evolution Beyond Ego. \r\n\r\nVisit: www.andrewcohen.org/ \r\n \r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 480, "image_id": 945, "added": "2010-09-11T14:08:09", "slug": "2656f73609ea45ef", "speakers": [{"id": 2065, "name": "Mr Andrew Cohen", "slug": "mr-andrew-cohen"}], "topics": [{"id": 316, "name": "philosophy", "path": "/arts/art/philosophy"}, {"id": 1474, "name": "culture", "path": "/academic/society/culture/culture"}, {"id": 1822, "name": "philosophy", "path": "/academic/religion/religion/philosophy"}, {"id": 414, "name": "philosophy", "path": "/society/history/philosophy"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 2335, "name": "ttHE REMBRANDT HOTEL", "slug": "tthe-rembrandt-hotel", "city": "KNIGHTSBRIDGE", "postcode": "SW7 2RS"}, "organizer": {"id": 809, "name": "EnlightenNext", "slug": "enlightennext"}, "date": "2010-09-17", "dates": [{"id": 9205, "from_date": "2010-09-17", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "10:30:00", "ticket_cost": "£75 (£55 concessions)", "ticket_info": "http://www.alternatives.org.uk/Site/CartView.aspx", "additional_info": "Map http://www.hotel-knightsbridge.co.uk/rembrandt/includes/map.asp", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 2335, "name": "ttHE REMBRANDT HOTEL", "slug": "tthe-rembrandt-hotel", "city": "KNIGHTSBRIDGE", "postcode": "SW7 2RS"}, "organizer": {"id": 809, "name": "EnlightenNext", "slug": "enlightennext"}}]}, {"id": 8798, "title": "Science Oxford Live's Greatest Hits: Friends and Lovers (Talk)", "synopsis": "The latest news from the science of Homo sapiens", "keywords": "Science, Adults, Talk", "body": "What makes us Human?

Using this gigantic machine - which can recreate conditions in the early Universe fractions of a second after the Big Bang - Brian and Jeff will describe the current theory behind the origin of mass. \r\n\r\nAlongside questions of energy and mass, they will consider the third, and perhaps, most intriguing element of the equation: 'c' - or the speed of light. Why is the speed of light the exchange rate? Answering this question is at the heart of the investigation as the speakers demonstrate how, in order to truly understand why E=mc2, we first must understand why we must move forward in time and not backwards and how objects in our 3-dimensional world actually move in 4-dimensional space-time. In other words, how the very fabric of our world is constructed.", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": null, "added": "2009-08-04T10:10:26", "slug": "b69c593e6485e807", "speakers": [{"id": 4949, "name": "Professor Brian Cox", "slug": "professor-brian-cox"}, {"id": 8524, "name": "Prof Jeff Forshaw", "slug": "prof-jeff-forshaw"}], "topics": [{"id": 551, "name": "physics", "path": "/children/science/physics"}, {"id": 805, "name": "einstein", "path": "/science/physics/quantummechanics/einstein"}, {"id": 1092, "name": "physics", "path": "/academic/computerscience/physics"}, {"id": 155, "name": "quantummechanics", "path": "/science/physics/quantummechanics"}], "supercategory": "children", "venue": {"id": 1729, "name": "The Royal Institution", "slug": "the-royal-institution", "city": "London", "postcode": "W1S 4BS"}, "organizer": {"id": 1729, "name": "The Royal Institution", "slug": "the-royal-institution"}, "date": "2009-11-26", "dates": [{"id": 7239, "from_date": "2009-11-26", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "19:00:00", "ticket_cost": "Tickets cost £8 standard, £6 concessions, £4 Ri Members.", "ticket_info": "For more information visit www.rigb.org or call the Events Team on 020 7409 2992 9.00am-5.00pm Monday to Friday", "additional_info": null, "members_only": "No", "members_info": "To become a member of the Ri please visit www.rigb.org/membership or call 020 7670 2919.", "venue": {"id": 1729, "name": "The Royal Institution", "slug": "the-royal-institution", "city": "London", "postcode": "W1S 4BS"}, "organizer": {"id": 1729, "name": "The Royal Institution", "slug": "the-royal-institution"}}]}, {"id": 6704, "title": "Environmental Parliament", "synopsis": " INVITATION TO INFORM & DEBATE\r\n                      The Pacific Ocean - Debate & Consensus - Geo Engineering and Action\r\nSunday May 3rd 2009 at 3pm in London\r\nRavens Ait Island Environmental Community Conference and Debate Centre,\r\nKingston-On-Thames", "keywords": " INVITATION TO INFORM & DEBATE\r\n                      The Pacific Ocean - Debate & Consensus - Geo Engineering and Action\r\nSunday May 3rd 2009 at 3pm in London\r\nRavens Ait Island Environmental Community Conference and Debate Centre,\r\nKingston-On-Thames", "body": "Environmental Parliament                                                                        \r\n                                                     INVITATION TO INFORM & DEBATE\r\n                      The Pacific Ocean - Debate & Consensus - Geo Engineering and Action\r\nSunday May 3rd 2009 at 3pm in London\r\nRavens Ait Island Environmental Community Conference and Debate Centre,\r\nKingston-On-Thames\r\n \r\nAGENDA QUESTIONS\r\n1)What are the 5 top issues and tipping points for the Pacific oceanic environment?\r\n2)What is real and meaningful in environmental action for the Pacific and other oceans.\r\n3)What does and does not cause warming, depletion and acidification of the oceans.\r\n4)What is the Truth about the oceanic ecosystem:  What, where, when, why, how and who?\r\n5)Geoscience & Geoengineering Solutions.... a)Focus on oceanic acidification and warming. b)Adress the plight of the Pacific ocean and the great pacific garbage islands. c) What are the programmes of US government and the UN? d) Is there any agenda item for the Copenhagen meetings about the Pacific ocean? e)What are the most effective oceanic geoengineering and geoscience schemes to adress?\r\n                                                                         AGENDA\r\n  We will discuss and debate Oceanic Pollution,  acidity, warming, salinity, carbon sinks, pollution zones, plankton, red blooms, & overfishing. We will follow the Texas size garbage island in the Pacific on a film presentation by an eyewitness Thomas Morton of VBS TV.\r\n\r\nVBS CORRESPONDENT THOMAS MORTON. In his own words: ''For years we've been reading about a patch of garbage the size of Texas floating in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, ingeniously dubbed the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. Basically, any trash that gets dumped in the water rides the currents to this one spot and joins an ever-increasing flotilla of crap. For all the breathless accounts of the mess and its impact on the area's sealife, however, no one seemed to have a picture of the buildup. In order to sate our own curiosity, VBS joined the crew of a research vessel studying the trash and sailed out into one of the most remote spots of open water in the world, the North Pacific Gyre, in search of this mythical garbage island. What we discovered once we got there was an ecological disaster beyond any of our expectations and possibly the single worst thing human beings have done to the planet and ourselves. Hope you're into cancer and sex-reversal!  \r\n\r\nBefore this trip, I was never all that crazy about the ocean. I’ve always appreciated the fact that it generates the majority of the world’s oxygen and keeps us nice and far from places like Britain, but in terms of any sort of awe or “respect” it just never happened. I would say I looked at it less as the primeval womb of all terrestrial life than as an excessive amount of water you sometimes have to fly over. \r\n\r\nPart and parcel with this was my attitude toward the Pacific Garbage Patch, or as we willfully misidentified it for the duration of our journey, the elusive Garbage Island. All the journalism I’d read about the patch had carefully danced around physical descriptions of the trash, leading myself and the rest of the shooting crew to fanciful visions of a solid, Texas-size barge of discarded Coke bottles and sporting goods. The idea that people had managed to fuck up a part of the world that nobody even visits, much less inhabits, and on such a monumental scale struck me as interesting and, to be honest, slightly awesome-sounding, but at the end of the day the impact of the mess on the rest of the world failed to register. I mean, sure, sea birds choking to death on deflated balloons and sea turtles whose shells have been completely deformed by soda can rings (click here for a picture of this if you want to completely ruin your day)—all this definitely sucks, but so do a lot of things, you know?\r\n\r\nNeedless to say this whole journey ended up overturning my expectations about the Garbage Patch, as well as just about every misconception I’ve ever held about the sea, environmentalism, consumption, barfing, knots, pollution, humanity, and myself. After absorbing the myriad dangers of our plastic-heavy lifestyles for three weeks, I’m now a proud, carbon-conscious “Earth Warrior” who yells at grocery clerks for double-bagging my produce and carries around one of those 70s gunnysacks to drink out of. Just kidding, although the trip did lead me to ferret out a group of non-hippie environmentalists. I finally got to join 'Earth Crisis'. Pretty decent.''\r\n\r\nLater we will project another short film, this one by David De Rothschild about Pacific Ocean pollution and the Plastiki expedition.\r\n\r\nIntroduced and moderated by Pano Kroko, founder  of the Environmental Parliament. \r\nwww.environmentalparliament.org {Invitation to join the EcoParliament Network}\r\n panokroko@gmail.com  Tel 07952761480\r\nAll major Environmental Organizations have been invited to participate in the debate.\r\nHOW TO GET THERE : RAVENS AIT ISLAND   \r\nRaven’s Ait - Portsmouth Road - Kingston upon Thames, KT6 4HN\r\nRail overground Kingston or Surbiton (both on the South side of the river)\r\nFrom Kingston head to the river and walk down the towpath (or get a 465 bus down Portsmouth rd which is beside the river and get off as soon as the 465 goes off Portsmouth Rd).

The only problem is to get people to look at the evidence. Once they are willing to do this, they quickly see that the official story simply cannot be true\"\r\n\r\nGriffin, who has published 7 books regarding the events of 9/11, remains a highly respected academic, and has won praise for his work on 9/11 by credible figures such as former Wall Street Journal editor Paul Craig Roberts, British MP Michael Meacher, prominent US historian Howard Zinn, and former CIA officials Robert Baer, Bill Christison, and Ray McGovern.\r\n\r\nThe view Griffin is forwarding is no longer an extreme minority position. TIME magazine recently described the view as \"a mainstream political reality\", and a recent poll by World Public Opinion revealed that only 57% of Britons cite a belief that 9/11 was Al Qaeda's sole responsibility. In the US various professional groups have started to pop up, such as Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth, Firefighters for 9/11 Truth and Political Leaders for 9/11 Truth. It is in this context that Professor Griffin is asking us to take a second look at these events, which after all were a pivotal event in modern history and surely deserve proper scrutiny.\r\n\r\nWe hope you can make it along to what promises to be a thought provoking, challenging and enjoyable evening for all who attend.

Yet much of our mental life is unconscious, based on processes alien to logic: gut feelings, or intuitions. In his lecture Dr Gigerenzer argues that intuition is more than impulse and caprice; it has its own rationale. This can be described by fast and frugal heuristics, which exploit evolved abilities in our brain. Heuristics ignore information and try to focus on the few important reasons. He shows that biased minds that intuitively rely of heuristics can make better inferences about the world than information-greedy statistical algorithms. More information, more time, even more thinking, are not always better, and less can be more. \r\n\r\nGerd Gigerenzer is the director of the Centre for Adaptive Behaviour and Cognition at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development in Berlin.

In his new book Terror and Consent  and in this lecture Professor Bobbitt argues that we are fighting these wars with weapons and concepts which though useful to us in previous conflicts have now been superseded. He aims to provide a fundamental rethinking of most generally accepted ideas about terror in the modern world – what it is, how it operates and above all how it can be frustrated. Philip Bobbitt argues that we need to reforge the links between law and strategy; to realize how the evolution of modern states, which have always produced terrorists in their own image, has now produced a globally networked terrorism; to combine humanitarian interests with strategies of intervention; and above all to rethink what ‘victory’ in such a war, if it is a war, might look like – no occupied capitals, no treaties, no victory parades, but the preservation, protection and defence of human rights and of states of consent. It is central to his argument that we are fighting terror and not just terrorists. \r\n\r\nBobbitt addresses questions about the nature and uses of intelligence, the apparently intractable persistence of torture, whether it is permissible for states to curtail citizens’ freedoms in order to protect them, and the role of the United States in the world, with boldness and originality.\r\n\r\nPhilip Bobbitt is Herbert Wechsler Professor of Federal Jurisprudence and Director of the Center for National Security at Columbia University.

Its pages contain rites for raising spirits, mystical instructions, recipes for magical potions, incense-making instructions, names of demons, curses, blessings, talismans, sigils, planetary prayers and astrological figurations.  The <em>Picatrix</em> was hugely influential on European magic, a true “grandfather of grimoires”. Originally written in Arabic, then soon after translated into Latin, it has never been fully translated into English, hence the <em>Picatrix</em> has been somewhat inaccessible to the modern reader unfamiliar with Latin or Arabic. Since it is not in print, tonight’s speaker will both introduce the grimoire and aim to bring it alive. She will take us into the world of the <em>Picatrix</em>: its Arabic origins, its extraordinary magical contents, and its huge influence upon occult ritual and magic in Europe through the entire pre-modern period.  A talk for all lovers of magic and its history in the West.\r\n\r\nLiana Saif is researching a doctorate at Birkbeck, University of London.

His father's main residence had been at Trier and Constantine must have spent much time there both during and after his father's life, before he crossed the Alps with an army in 312 eventually to defeat his western rival outside Rome at the \"Battle of the Milvian Bridge\". It was in 313 that he met with his ally in the East, Licinius, in Milan. Constantinople was founded in 324 and dedicated in 330. The first ecumenical council was held at Nicaea (Iznik as now) in 325.

These three separate year courses form a coherent survey of the fine art, architecture, design and decorative arts in Europe from the late Middle Ages to the First World War.", "keywords": "rococo, modernism, WWI, art history, neoclassical,", "body": "This course is a chronological survey of the fine and applied arts in Europe from the early eighteenth century to the early twentieth century.  It was a period of widespread political and social change. In 1720, countries like Britain and France were expanding nation states but many other regions of Europe were still parts of empires and only emerged as independent countries during the nineteenth century.  Gradually European nations became industrialised and their capitalist economies depended increasingly on mechanisation at home and colonial expansion throughout the world.  Finally, there came the conflagration of the First World War.\r\n\r\nAgainst this historical background, the course will explore the diversity of artistic ideas and styles.  It offers a unique perspective by covering not only the fine arts &#8211; painting, sculpture and architecture &#8211; but also design, the decorative arts and popular visual culture.  Many of these areas are well represented in the V&A&#8217;s own collections, particularly in the new British Galleries and the course themes reflect this. \r\n\r\nThe course attempts to account for the &#8216;Why&#8217; as well as explaining the &#8216;How&#8217;.  Within the format of a chronological survey, lectures embrace certain general themes and stylistic trends, as well as the works of some individual artists or particular materials and art forms.  The programme is designed to \r\ndemonstrate that different branches of the visual arts have not shown the same trajectory of change in this two hundred year period.  We consider the relationship of the different arts to the wider political, economic and cultural context of the period and explore themes such as taste, patronage and the art market.  Although we concentrate on developments in western Europe, we also look at Russia and the USA.\r\n\r\nTickets: \r\nFull course: £1525, Concessionary rate(V&A members and patrons): £1375\r\n\r\nPer Term: full rate: £525, senior citizens, V&A members and Patrons: £475, Students, disabled and ES40 holders £132.\r\n\r\nCertificate Option: £350 (in addition to full course fees and payable in full before commencing the course, no concessions).\r\n\r\nDay Rate: Full rate:£45, senior citizens, V&A members and Patrons: £41, students, disabled and ES-40 holders £11.\r\n\r\nMorning coffee/tea is included.
