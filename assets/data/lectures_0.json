Desktop surveillance. Acronyms. Diminishing job security. Dan Lyons, bestselling author of Disrupted and writer on the HBO series Silicon Valley, deliciously roasts the new work climate, while asking what can be done to recoup some sanity and dignity for the expanding class of middle-class serfs.\r\n\r\nFirst, you are lucky to be here. Also, we do not care about you. We offer no job security. This is not a career. We provide no training or career development. We will pay you as little as possible. You will work long hours under constant pressure and with no privacy. We will read your email. HR will not help you. Your managers may not know what they are doing. They also may be abusive. If you file a complaint you may be fired. You may be fired even though you’re doing a good job. You may be fired for no reason at all. We do not offer day care. There are snacks and beer in the kitchen.\r\n\r\nPersonality tests. Team-building exercises. Forced Fun. Desktop surveillance. Open-plan offices. Acronyms. Diminishing job security. Hot desking. Pointless perks. Hackathons.\r\n\r\nIf any of the above sound familiar, welcome to the modern economy. In this hilarious, but deadly serious book, bestselling author Dan Lyons looks at how the world of work has slowly morphed from one of unions and steady career progression to a dystopia made of bean bags and unpaid internships. And that's the 'good' jobs...\r\n\r\nWith the same wit that made Disrupted an international bestseller, Lyons shows how the hypocrisy of Silicon Valley has now been exported globally to a job near you. Even low-grade employees are now expected to view their jobs with a cult-like fervour, despite diminishing prospects of promotion. From the gig economy to the new digital oligarchs, Lyons deliciously roasts the new work climate, while asking what can be done to recoup some sanity and dignity for the expanding class of middle-class serfs.\r\n\r\nDan Lyons is an author, journalist, and screenwriter. He has co-produced and written for the HBO series Silicon Valley, was technology editor at Newsweek and was the creator of the ground-breaking viral blog \"The Secret Diary of Steve Jobs\" (AKA \"Fake Steve Jobs\").

Then, as part of the programme, explore the books, documents and records in our Library and Catalogue and have personal consultations with our Help and Advice Team looking at your family tree. Sixteen workshops and talks, help using our Library and lunch included in the cost.\r\n\r\nHave you found the basic records that show where your family lived in London? Do you have an idea of the jobs they did? Perhaps you have even found the streets they lived in. But life in Victorian London was extraordinary. It was already a major world city. The wealth it produced and expended was incredible. The poverty and appalling living conditions in some areas was shocking. Your Victorian ancestors were also living in an era of rapidly developing science, transport, politics and industry. So what was it like to live in Victorian London? This Getaway Week focuses on Victorian London families: how they lived, the issues they faced, their daily lives in the context of the social and local history of London.\r\n\r\nAims and objectives\r\nSpread over the five days, we aim to help you to develop your understanding of how your London ancestors lived and how their lives were affected by the social and local history of London. We will focus primarily on Victorian London under some broad themes: birth and baptism; health, marriage, family and society; work and school; death and burial.\r\n\r\nEnhance your techniques to find records and information that will help you to build up a picture of your London ancestors’ lives.\r\n\r\nDevelop an understanding of the underlying social and local context of London life. An appreciation of the issues your ancestors faced enables you to make more sense of what they did and what happened to them.\r\n\r\nLearn about the lesser known sources of records and data that will help you to really put some flesh on your ancestors’ bones.\r\n\r\nTime for your own research\r\nWe’ve built into the programme some time each day for you to do your own research. Of course, you will want to use the Society's remarkable Library collection of over 120,000 items - 4 floors full of fascinating records. And you can book personal consultations with the tutors and members of the Society’s expert Help and Advice Team to discuss the challenges in your family tree.\r\n\r\nWho should attend\r\nEveryone researching their family history in London and building a family tree is very welcome. \r\n\r\nDo you have the basic details for your London ancestors but wonder why they made certain choices and how they lived? This five-day Getaway programme is ideal for you.\r\n\r\nExpect a friendly atmosphere, expert tutors and lots of detail. There is, of course, a sandwich lunch break and tea and coffee breaks during the day.

Capturing a moment of imminent transition, Estate reflects on urgent matters of regeneration, gentrification and architecture; its reasons, possibilities and consequences. The project sought to give the residents a voice and a visual presence – to counter the many myths and clichés of their mainstream representation with images of resilience, strength, and a celebration of spirited existence regardless of the social and economic hand they had been dealt.  It also hopes to offer a modest signpost towards a wider relevance and way of being in the city; a more inclusive and supportive form of social and personal interaction, taking place within a more porous and collectively focused urban environment. \r\nAndrea Luka Zimmerman is a filmmaker, artist and cultural activist. Andrea grew up on a large council estate and left school at 16.

This neglect is in marked contrast to the considerable attention he received in the first half of the 20th century. Santayana's range as a philosopher is wide, covering ontology, epistemology, ethics, the arts and sciences, religion, political and social issues. Also, his language possesses classic clarity. So, a revival of interest in him is long overdue - as is, indeed, a talk on him to the Conway Hall Ethical Society. His views on the excesses of industrialism and on the perennial need for virtue-politics are among the things which remain highly relevant in today’s society.

He has worked as a university and college lecturer, and as a private tutor, and is still active in the latter field.

In many spheres of life, and especially within the world of education, it might be claimed that the body is more often than not considered as a dimension of no importance or merely as a circumstantial factor also to take into account, but with no real meaning in and of itself. \r\n\r\nOver and against these tendencies I argue that certain bodily experiences are of the greatest importance. More precisely, I show that moments during which we coincide with the physical side of our existence grant the opportunity to invalidate every societal structuring of individual and communal life, and to install what I have called a moment of ‘democracy of the flesh’. \r\n\r\nMy work is also a criticism of a lot of recent scholarship that does take the body seriously (inside and outside education), but that immediately subordinates the body again to a regime of meaning and intentionality (a criticisable way of thinking which goes back to the work of Merleau-Ponty). I am, on the contrary, interested in the body taken in its full physicality - in a very literal sense: being-entirely-flesh. \r\n\r\nI have developed this approach in relation to events and practices that take place inside schools, such as the occurrence of (fits of) laughter in classrooms, calisthenics (as the most fundamental form of ‘physical’ education) and traditional forms of practising together and in a repetitive manner. I believe that this way of looking at the body can inspire everyone involved, practically and/or theoretically, with the body – and especially the body during collective movement practices.\r\n\r\nAbout Joris...\r\n\r\nJoris Vlieghe holds a BA in Art History, MA in Philosophy and PHD in Educational Sciences. He is currently a lecturer in philosophy of education at Edinburgh University.\r\n \r\nJoris’ research concerns the role of human corporeality for education, and over the past five years he has been investigating bodily dimensions of concrete teaching and learning practices. He has explored, among other things, traditional ‘school’ practices (repetitive and collective forms of exercise), old and new forms of Physical Education, the bodily experience one has when visiting educational museums and the educational value of the visualisation of the nude body.  Most lately, his focus has been on teaching and learning in today’s digitised world and investigating the meaning of traditional pedagogical notions such as attention, presence and community under digitised conditions.\r\n\r\nOther talks at what_now 2014:\r\n\r\nDerek McCormack: Thinking and moving with atmospheric things | Friday 11 April | 7pm\r\n\r\nCaroline Bergvall: Writing Gestures | Saturday 12 April | 2pm\r\n\r\nLaura Cull:  A(n Interrupted) Lecture on Attention in 9 Parts | Sunday 13 April | 3pm\r\n\r\nPrice: \r\n£6/£4 each\r\n£10/£7 for any two talks\r\n£18/£12 for all four talks\r\nBooking is highly recommended , please call 020 7091 9650 to purchase your tickets.\r\n\r\nVenue: \r\nSiobhan Davies Studios\r\n85 St George’s Road\r\nSE1 6ER\r\n\r\nFor more information about the residency and the guest speakers please visit http://www.independentdance.co.uk/programmepage/activities/what-festival/\r\n \r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": null, "image_id": 1768, "added": "2014-04-08T07:01:13", "slug": "fe29dda08fee1658", "speakers": [{"id": 14601, "name": "Joris Vlieghe", "slug": "joris-vlieghe"}], "topics": [{"id": 2676, "name": "dance", "path": "/arts/arts/education/dance"}, {"id": 1869, "name": "performance", "path": "/arts/film/videoart/performance"}, {"id": 3399, "name": "performance", "path": "/arts/art/contemporaryart/performance"}, {"id": 1018, "name": "talk", "path": "/arts/education/debate/talk"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 1781, "name": "Independent Dance", "slug": "independent-dance", "city": "London", "postcode": "SE1 6ER"}, "organizer": {"id": 1781, "name": "Independent Dance", "slug": "independent-dance"}, "date": "2014-04-12", "dates": [{"id": 14099, "from_date": "2014-04-12", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "19:30:00", "ticket_cost": "£6/£4 each; £10/£7 for any two talks; £18/£12 for all four talks", "ticket_info": "Please call 020 7091 9650 to purchase your tickets.", "additional_info": "http://www.independentdance.co.uk/programmepage/activities/what-festival/", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 1781, "name": "Independent Dance", "slug": "independent-dance", "city": "London", "postcode": "SE1 6ER"}, "organizer": {"id": 1781, "name": "Independent Dance", "slug": "independent-dance"}}]}, {"id": 13567, "title": "Almina , Fifth Countess of Carnarvon", "synopsis": "A talk on Almina Fifth Countees of Carnarvon based on her biography \" The Life and Secrets of Almina Carnarvon\" by William Cross", "keywords": "Almina Carnarvon, Highclere, Downton Abbey, Tutankhamun, William Cross, Herbert Family, Countess of Carnarvon, Highclere Castle", "body": "Almina Carnarvon has left behind a curse as deadly as the one that overshadowed her legendry husband, George Edward Stanhope Molyneux Herbert, the 5th Earl of Carnarvon, co-discoverer with Howard Carter of the Tomb of Tutankhamun.

Research by Parkinson’s UK is paving the way for the next generation of treatments that can protect these precious cells, to slow or stop the progression of Parkinson’s.\r\n\r\nDr Ungless will focus on our understanding of these cells. What do they do? How do they communicate?

The intellectual training of the great theologians of the 4th century, such as Saint Augustine, was based on the philosophy of Plato and the later schools of Platonic thought. Early Christian art was not a matter of decoration, or narrative or aesthetics; rather it was a vehicle for understanding the universal ideas at the heart of all religion and philosophy: the meaning of human life on earth and in eternity.\r\n \r\nThe slides show some Byzantine icons from the 6th century but many of the ideas are illustrated with Russian icons of the 15th and 16th centuries.  The art of Orthodox Christianity is universal and timeless.\r\n\r\nThis lecture will be given by Dr Richard Temple who founded the Temple Gallery in 1959 as a centre for the study, restoration and exhibition of ancient icons and sacred art. He is a member of the Advisory Panel of the Art Fund and has been active in the acquisition of icons by the British Museum, the Musée du Louvre in Paris, the Timken Art Gallery in San Diego, California and the Museum of the Church of the Holy Redeemer in Moscow. Over the years he has published many catalogues and scholarly articles. In 1990 his book Icons and the Mystical Origins of Christianity was published by Element Books.

Why don’t facts work? Why, that is, did the obviously intelligent man beside him sincerely believe in Adam and Eve, the Garden of Eden and a six-thousand-year-old Earth, in spite of the evidence against them?\r\n\r\nIt was the start of a journey that would lead Storr all over the world – from Texas to Warsaw to the Outer Hebrides – meeting an extraordinary cast of modern heretics whom he tries his best to understand. He goes on a tour of Holocaust sites with David Irving and a band of neo-Nazis, experiences his own murder during ‘past life regression’ hypnosis, discusses the looming One World Government with iconic climate sceptic Lord Monckton and investigates the tragic life and death of a woman who believed her parents were high priests in a baby-eating cult.\r\n\r\nUsing a unique mix of highly personal memoir, investigative journalism and the latest research from neuroscience and experimental psychology, Storr reveals how the stories we tell ourselves about the world invisibly shape our beliefs, and how the neurological ‘hero maker’ inside us all can so easily lead to self-deception, toxic partisanship and science denial.\r\n\r\nWill Storr is a longform journalist and novelist. His features have appeared in various publications, including Guardian Weekend, The Times Magazine, Observer Magazine, GQ, Marie Claire and the Sydney Morning Herald. He is a contributing editor at Esquire magazine. He has been named New Journalist of the Year and Feature Writer of the Year, and has won a National Press Club award for excellence. In 2010, his investigation into the kangaroo meat industry won the Australian Food Media award for Best Investigative Journalism and, in 2012, he was presented with the One World Press award and the Amnesty International award for his work on sexual violence against men.\r\nHis latest book is The Heretics - Adventures with the Enemies of Science.\r\n / @wstorr\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 120, "image_id": null, "added": "2013-03-26T07:43:17", "slug": "18668ec4cb135e0a", "speakers": [{"id": 13578, "name": "Will Storr", "slug": "will-storr"}], "topics": [{"id": 174, "name": "ethics", "path": "/science/ethics"}, {"id": 1822, "name": "philosophy", "path": "/academic/religion/religion/philosophy"}, {"id": 2388, "name": "philosophy", "path": "/arts/literature/philosophy/philosophy"}, {"id": 910, "name": "science", "path": "/arts/film/documentary/science"}, {"id": 163, "name": "philosophy", "path": "/science/philosophy"}, {"id": 1211, "name": "parapsychology", "path": "/science/parapsychology"}, {"id": 148, "name": "psychology", "path": "/science/psychology"}, {"id": 1680, "name": "psychicalresearch", "path": "/science/psychicalresearch"}, {"id": 571, "name": "science", "path": "/science/science"}, {"id": 166, "name": "theories", "path": "/science/theories"}, {"id": 522, "name": "testing", "path": "/science/testing"}], "supercategory": "science", "venue": {"id": 1620, "name": "SPES", "slug": "spes", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC1R 4RL"}, "organizer": {"id": 1620, "name": "SPES", "slug": "spes"}, "date": "2013-04-28", "dates": [{"id": 12742, "from_date": "2013-04-28", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "11:00:00", "ticket_cost": "£3", "ticket_info": "\r\n", "additional_info": "Bottomless Tea & Coffee will be available.", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 1620, "name": "SPES", "slug": "spes", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC1R 4RL"}, "organizer": {"id": 1620, "name": "SPES", "slug": "spes"}}]}, {"id": 12106, "title": "Transformations in Egyptian Journalism since the January 25 Revolution", "synopsis": "Naomi Sakr looks at transformations in Egyptian journalism and the place of participatory cross-media networks", "keywords": "Frontline club, Frontline Club Talk, Egypt, Journalism", "body": "Third party event organised by Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism.\r\n\r\nEgypt’s revolutionary uprising in 2011 raised important questions about the kind of journalism that would be viable in the country’s changing political dynamics.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the output of bloggers, online radio and social media news operations, which had all formed part of the groundswell of action against dictatorship and repression, posed an explicit challenge to journalists in state-run and commercial media companies who were more directly subject to government controls.\r\n\r\nIn this launch event for her new book, Naomi Sakr looks at recent transformations in Egyptian journalism, exploring diverse approaches to converged media and the place of participatory cross-media networks in expanding and developing the country’s body of professional journalists.\r\n\r\nNaomi Sakr will present her new book Transformations in Egyptian Journalism: Perspectives on News Work after the January 25 Revolution.\r\n\r\nWith:\r\n\r\nNaomi Sakr, Professor of Media Policy at the Communication and Media Research Institute (CAMRI), University of Westminster, and Director of the CAMRI Arab Media Centre.\r\n\r\nDr Walter Armbrust, Hourani Fellow and University Lecturer in Modern Middle Eastern Studies at the University of Oxford.

Today programme presenter Evan Davis chairs this debate on the motion “Britain should stay in the European Union.” \r\n\r\nTony Blair's former EU adviser Sir Stephen Wall will defend the proposition against a panel that are opposed to Britain remaining in the EU in its current guise. \r\n\r\nThe debate is being recorded for broadcast on BBC Radio 4. It will be broadcast on Wednesday 8 August at 8pm and will be repeated on Saturday 11 August at 10.15pm. \r\n\r\nSir Stephen Wall worked closely with five British Foreign Secretaries and was Foreign Policy Adviser to Prime Minister John Major. He was British Ambassador to Portugal from 1993 to 1995, Permanent Representative to the European Union from 1995 to 2000 and Head of the European Secretariat in the Cabinet Office and EU adviser to the Prime Minister from 2000 to 2004. From 2004 to 2005 he was the Principal Adviser to the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Westminster. Sir Stephen is Chair of the Council of University College, London, Chair of the Federal Trust, Chair of Trustees at Cumberland Lodge, Member of the Council of Wilton Park, Member of the Board of Trustees of the Thomson Foundation, Trustee of the Franco-British Council and Honorary Fellow of Selwyn College Cambridge. He is also on the Council of the European Council on Foreign Relations. \r\n\r\nRoger Helmer was first elected to the European parliament in 1999 for the East Midlands region, subsequently being re-elected in 2004 and 2009.

Roger won a State Scholarship to Churchill College, Cambridge, where he read mathematics, graduating in 1965 with a B.A. and subsequently an M.A. He started his business career in 1965 with Procter & Gamble in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, going on to hold senior marketing and general management appointments in a range of companies, including well-known multinationals like Readers Digest, National Semiconductor, Coats Viyella and the whisky firm United Distillers, now part of the drinks conglomerate Diageo. \r\n\r\nMark Reckless is the Conservative member of parliament for Rochester and Strood, having been elected in 2010.

Robert Shiller is no apologist for the sins of finance--he is probably the only person to have predicted both the stock market bubble of 2000 and the real estate bubble that led up to the subprime mortgage meltdown. However in his new book, he argues that, rather than condemning finance, we need to reclaim it for the common good. He makes a powerful case for recognizing that finance, far from being a parasite on society, is one of the most powerful tools we have for solving our common problems and increasing the general well-being. We need more financial innovation--not less--and finance should play a larger role in helping society achieve its goals. \r\n\r\nThis event marks the publication of Professor Shiller's new book Finance and the Good Society.\r\n\r\nRobert J.

Particular places, and perhaps especially cities, consist of large diasporic populations often represented as indications of cosmopolitanism, multiculturalism and conviviality. Diasporas may be formed through forced or voluntary movements, leaving behind certain places but having often powerful relationships to them, and creating new senses of place elsewhere. Ideas of diaspora, as well as travel, movement, and exile, have become important subjects and tropes within contemporary literature. Notions of longing and belonging are perhaps most discreetly and passionately played out in the novel, that may be biographical to the life of the author as exile and/or ‘global cosmopolitan’.

However, without them we would not exist.  Plants first colonized land 600 to 800 million years ago, with the aid of mutualist fungi.  Now, about 90% of terrestrial plants obtain their nutrients and water from soil through fungi associated mutualistically with their roots (mycorrhizas).  These same fungi offer protection from pathogens and allow plants to colonize polluted sites.  Furthermore, fungi are the main garbage disposal agents and nutrient recyclers of the natural world.  By rotting dead organic matter they make nutrients available to plants and animals alike, and provide important sources of nutrition including to humans.  Obvious examples are bread, beer and wine, cheese, non-soya meat substitutes, such as Quorn.  Less obvious is that fungi are essential for chocolate production, actually producing the characteristic flavour; they also make the acidity regulator citric acid used in soft drinks and pharmaceuticals.  Almost unrecognised are the anaerobic chytrid fungi that enable herbivorous animals to thrive on the plants they eat; without fungi - no meat, no milk, no wool, no leather and no herbivores.  Fungi have also provided us with antibiotics, e.g. penicillin, and many other ‘wonder drugs’ of the twenty-first century including the statins, to control cholesterol (the most widely used pharmaceuticals in the developed world), and cyclosporine, which prevents transplant tissue rejection.  Fungi also contribute to the production of steroid contraceptives and anti-inflamatories. \r\nOf a predicted 1.5 million species, so far only about 100,000 have been described and named. This fact in itself indicates the crucial need for fungal taxonomists.  The relative neglect of fungal science, including taxonomy, means that there is insufficient expertise in areas of direct and indirect concern to humans, including biodeterioration, food safety, plant diseases, human health, discovery of novel chemical compounds, conservation and ecosystem function. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLynne Boddy is Professor of Mycology at Cardiff University, and is also President of the British Mycological Society.  With over 30 years research experience and over 250 scientific publications, including several books, Lynne is one of the world’s leading fungal ecologists.  Her work focuses largely on the ecology of wood decay basidiomycete fungi (those commonly seen fruiting as toadstools, brackets etc.) that play crucial roles in recycling nutrients in forests.  She has been foremost in investigating how fungal communities change in wood, how fungi interact with one another and with invertebrates, and how fungi grow out of wood in search of new resources.\r\nLynne is currently the chief (and founding) editor of Fungal Ecology and is or has served on the editorial boards of the journals Fungal Biology Reviews, Mycological Research, Microbial Ecology, FEMS Microbiology Ecology and Ecological Informatics.  She has served on a variety of committees of the Natural Environment Research Council, organised numerous scientific meetings for the British Mycological Society, and is becoming increasingly involved in fungal education and outreach activities, including this years gold medal winning British Mycological Society exhibit at the Chelsea show.\r\n\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 120, "image_id": null, "added": "2009-10-12T11:54:21", "slug": "2f1948adf12df015", "speakers": [{"id": 7651, "name": "Professor Lynne Boddy", "slug": "professor-lynne-boddy"}], "topics": [{"id": 743, "name": "education", "path": "/academic/arts/linguistics/education"}, {"id": 1152, "name": "genetics", "path": "/science/biology/genetics"}, {"id": 1653, "name": "genetics", "path": "/science/evolution/genetics"}, {"id": 157, "name": "chromosomes", "path": "/science/genetics/chromosomes"}], "supercategory": "academic", "venue": {"id": 2081, "name": "Birkbeck University of London", "slug": "birkbeck-university-of-london", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC1H 0PD"}, "organizer": {"id": 1069, "name": "Ecology and Conservation Studies Society", "slug": "ecology-and-conservation-studies-society"}, "date": "2009-10-23", "dates": [{"id": 7576, "from_date": "2009-10-23", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "18:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": "E-mail:  environmentevents@FLL.bbk.ac.uk  for booking and venue details.

Thinking about the promise, risk, and plausibility of AI and VRs\r\n\r\nWith Amon Twyman\r\n2pm-4pm, Saturday 11th July 2009\r\n\r\nTranshumanism is a broad set of ideas and niche interests which collectively address the impact of technology on the human condition. The most radical thought experiments entertained by transhumanists often involve some reference to Artificial Intelligence (AI) and/or Virtual Reality (VR), and can be classed as Extreme Simulation Scenarios (ESS). Such scenarios can be equal parts attractive and disturbing. They describe conditions of radical liberation from traditional human constraints, but also open up entirely new categories of potential risk. Evaluations of ESS frequently conflate assessments of promise, risk, technological credibility, and congruence with extant belief systems.\r\n\r\nThis presentation will disentangle the various threads within ESS evaluation as follows:\r\n\r\n(1) explaining key ESS concepts such as uploads, utility fog, and virtual autonomous zones;\r\n(2) describing the principal extreme simulation scenarios and their historical roots;\r\n(3) evaluating specific criticisms of ESS; and\r\n(4) considering the degree to which assessments of ESS are often a matter of opposed assumptions and worldviews rather than the unprejudiced examination of evidence.\r\n\r\nCome along and learn how to think critically and constructively about some of the most revolutionary transhumanist ideas, and how they relate to our current culture and technology.\r\n\r\nAbout the speaker\r\n\r\nAmon Twyman is a cognitive scientist and artist based in London. His work within cognitive psychology at University College London has investigated the role of conscious awareness in decision making, and he has explored transhumanist themes as a member of electro-industrial band Xykogen.\r\n\r\nThere is no charge to attend and everyone is welcome.

How does profound development at the level of consciousness directly relate to genuine transformation at a cultural level? \r\n\r\nAndrew Cohen - world renowned spiritual teacher, author and cultural pioneer - is passionately dedicated to inspiring as many people as possible to be responsible for the greatest task there is - evolving consciousness and creating a new culture together.  The revolutionary idealist has been charting the terrain of the New Enlightenment for over two decades, advocating a spiritual perspective that embraces the deep time evolutionary process. \r\n\r\nThrough his engaged approach to spiritual inquiry, Cohen will illuminate how our very understanding of non-dual awakening evolves over time as we do, and how its significance takes on new dimensions and importance as the conditions of our world become ever more complex. Originator of Evolutionary Enlightenment - a contemporary spiritual and philosophical teaching - he has mapped a comprehensive framework for the development of our higher human potentials. Central to this teaching is our awakening to an understanding and experiential recognition of the evolutionary impulse as the animating life-force within us. By becoming ever more conscious of this force, and aligning ourselves to it, we can become powerful instruments for human transformation, starting at the most fundamental level - the level of consciousness itself. \r\n\r\n\"I believe that if we want the world to change in a significant way, and if we're serious about creating a better future for us all, then the only way it's going to happen is the only way it's ever happened: through the evolution of consciousness and culture. For the universe to evolve at this level, those of us at the leading edge - that fortunate minority of us who have been blessed with wealth, education, and the time to consider these higher matters - have to make sure it happens. We have to be the ones to create the future.\" \r\n\r\nThe founder of EnlightenNext and its flagship magazine of the same name, Cohen has been teaching for over twenty years; he has set up eleven centres worldwide and inspired a substantial global following of ‘new evolutionaries'.

He studied Botany at Cambridge and started his research career as a plant physiologist in Lancaster, investigating how plants consume water and respond to deficits.  He became interested in how species compete for resources and moved to Cranfield University to work with a team of hydrologists and soil physicists to understand how soil water controls vegetation.  \r\nHe has become involved in the emerging discipline of Ecohydrology and has applied ecological principles to the management of water in soils for nature conservation objectives, advising a range of nature conservation bodies on site management issues.  For the past 8 years, he has worked for the Open University, contributing material to their distance-learning modules in Ecology, Environmental Science and Ecosystems.  He has built a research group there looking at vegetation ecology in relation to water and nutrient management.  His primary research focus for the past 15 years has been the species-rich plant communities of floodplain meadows and their conservation requirements.  In 2007, he helped found the Floodplain Meadows Partnership, which is a forum for all agencies involved in their conservation.  \r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 120, "image_id": null, "added": "2009-01-24T01:29:19", "slug": "74c142c14d439bf9", "speakers": [{"id": 7997, "name": "Professor David Gowing", "slug": "professor-david-gowing"}], "topics": [{"id": 427, "name": "ecology", "path": "/arts/architecture/ecology"}, {"id": 752, "name": "conservation", "path": "/science/naturalhistory/conservation"}, {"id": 924, "name": "conservation", "path": "/academic/naturalhistory/conservation"}, {"id": 1002, "name": "conservation", "path": "/leisure/conservation/conservation"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 487, "name": "Birkbeck College", "slug": "birkbeck-college", "city": "LONDON", "postcode": "WC1E 7HX"}, "organizer": {"id": 1069, "name": "Ecology and Conservation Studies Society", "slug": "ecology-and-conservation-studies-society"}, "date": "2009-02-20", "dates": [{"id": 6693, "from_date": "2009-02-20", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "18:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": "E-mail: environmentevents@FLL.bbk.ac.uk  for booking and venue details, (telephone  020 7679 1069)", "additional_info": "Booking essential", "members_only": "No", "members_info": "Details of the Society and application forms will be available at the door, and are on our website http://www.bbk.ac.uk/ce/environment/ecssociety/index.shtml", "venue": {"id": 487, "name": "Birkbeck College", "slug": "birkbeck-college", "city": "LONDON", "postcode": "WC1E 7HX"}, "organizer": {"id": 1069, "name": "Ecology and Conservation Studies Society", "slug": "ecology-and-conservation-studies-society"}}]}, {"id": 6044, "title": "Benjamin Franklin and Espionage", "synopsis": "The last quarter of the 18th century was a turbulent time – the American War of Independence and the French Revolution in particular exacerbated international tensions.", "keywords": "Benjamin Franklin, American War, Independence, the French Revolution, espionage", "body": "The last quarter of the 18th century was a turbulent time – the American War of Independence and the French Revolution in particular exacerbated international tensions.

As recently as 1910, average life expectancy in the UK was only 50 years. Today, men can expect to live to their mid-to-late seventies, and women into the early eighties.\r\n\r\nThis raises a number of issues, some would say problems, for society, medicine and individuals. Experts worry about the burden an ageing population places on pensions and the NHS. But, as American bioethicist Leon Kass argues, ‘the challenges of an aging society are finally not economic and institutional but ethical and existential’. Culturally, we seem confused in our attitudes to aging and indeed death. Modern medicine is defined by the struggle to keep the grim reaper at bay, and this constant striving to put off the inevitable – to ‘rage against the dying of the light’ – is in many ways laudable, expressing a celebration of life. But some fear we are sacrificing quality of life by keeping people alive, no matter how old or frail they become. Is today’s pursuit of immortality, and eternal youth, a desperate reaction to our loss of faith in the ‘eternal life’ promised by religion?\r\n\r\nIs increasing the human lifespan a straightforward moral imperative, or should we accept death as something that gives meaning to life? Does our desire to live ever longer express a selfish attitude that neglects our responsibilities to those who will care for us?

She believes that the more journalists talk to well respected scientists, the more they’ll know about how science works and the better reported science will be. And vice-versa, the better scientists are at talking to journalists, the less sensationalism and bad reporting there will be. \r\n\r\n•\tFelicity Mellor, from Imperial College’s Science Communication group, thinks journalists should have a more cynical and investigative attitude towards science. She says that all too often journalists accept what scientist’s press offices tell them without thinking more deeply.

This suggests that the brain's assumptions about the stability of the visual world play a much greater role in perceiving a 3D scene than we had supposed. Subjects make simple judgements, such as comparing the size of two objects they see at different times. From their responses, we can determine how they combine information about the distance of objects with prior assumptions about the world.\r\n\r\nOne thing seems clear: people do not construct little 3D \"models\" of the world in their head.
