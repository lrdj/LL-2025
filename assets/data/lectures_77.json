Stemming from this effort, this event will feature a panel with presentations and roundtable discussion by three outstanding experts of Holocaust history, Professor Tim Cole, Professor Dan Stone and Dr Gabor Kadar.

The event will include a talk by the author and a reception with light refreshments.\r\n\r\nDespite some pioneering work by scholars, historians still find it hard to listen to the voices of women in the Holocaust. Learning more about the women who both survived and did not survive the Nazi genocide — through the testimony of the women themselves — not only increases our understanding of this terrible period in history, but makes us rethink our relationship to the gendered nature of knowledge itself. Women in the Holocaust is about the ways in which socially- and culturally-constructed gender roles were placed under extreme pressure; yet also about the fact that gender continued to operate as an important arbiter of experience. Indeed, paradoxically enough, the extreme conditions of the Holocaust — even of the death camps — may have reinforced the importance of gender.\r\n\r\nWhilst Jewish men and women were both sentenced to death, gender nevertheless operated as a crucial signifier for survival. Pregnant women as well as women accompanied by young children or those deemed incapable of hard labour were sent straight to the gas chambers. The very qualities which made them women were manipulated and exploited by the Nazis as a source of dehumanization. Moreover, women were less likely to survive the camps even if they were not selected for death. Gender in the Holocaust therefore became a matter of life and death.\r\n\r\nDr Zoë Waxman is a Senior Research Fellow at the Oxford Centre for Hebrew and Jewish Studies. She previously taught in the history faculty in Oxford and at Royal Holloway, University of London, where she was fellow in Holocaust Studies.

When he was growing up, the dominant ethical debate in Britain was between the “pessimists”, who believed we are all fundamentally selfish, and the “optimists”, who vehemently denied this. The latter were all devout Christians, and so for those sceptical of orthodox religion (like the young Hume), the only credible view was the pessimistic one. After publishing his first book, however, Hume had an epiphany—prompted by, of all things, the sermons of an English clergyman—and was persuaded of the optimistic alternative. He then had the profoundly important realisation that this view is consistent with scepticism about religion. This talk will tell the story of this hugely significant moment in the history of ideas.\r\n\r\nDr Amyas Merivale, winner of Conway Hall’s Blackham Fellowship award, is a lecturer and outreach officer in Philosophy and Computer Science at the University of Oxford.

Thought to be the source of all ancient wisdom and knowledge, founder of civilization, master of magic, the arts, and sciences, Hermes Trismegistus was believed to be a contemporary of Moses, the teacher of Plato, and for some his prestige equalled that of Jesus Christ. Yet in the early seventeenth century, this legendary figure lost all credibility, and the hermetic philosophy associated with his name became a laughing stock. Who was this remarkable individual, why did his mystic teachings lose their standing at the start of the modern age, and is there anything we, at the end of it, can learn from him?

In these films love, desire and politics blur the borderline between personal loyalty and the perceived demands of patriotism and national identity. FilmTalk stresses film as much as talk. The lectures are 20-25 minutes long and are followed or intercut with excerpts from the films under review.\r\n\r\n", "keywords": "FilmTalk, Jews", "body": "Samson and Delilah presents us with fascinating contradictions. It is a film made at the height of the Hollywood studio system, which celebrates the heroic underdog and racial minorities: it both reviles and celebrates the female body: and it combines a lush visual texture with a stern moralism. Besides trying to reconcile these contradictions, Sue Harper will analyse the symbolism of hair (not just Samson’s) and will examine the function of Edith Head’s costume designs, particularly the peacock cloak. She will assess the input of the Zionist thinker Vladimir Jabotinsky to the film’s script, and will compare the film’s treatment of Jewish/Arab relation with others in the same period. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSue Harper is Emeritus Professor of Film History at the University of Portsmouth.

Given that we live in a world in which nation states and other groups develop weapons with appalling possibilities, should scientists never take part, or can the defensive development of such weapons sometimes be the lesser evil? The uses of science for dark purposes: for torture, and for atrocities, either in war or as acts of terrorism can be seen in many cases throughout history, notably with regard to atomic and bioogical weapons.  After medicine and medical research was used in atrocities by the Nazis, the medical world drew up codes of ethics governing research, and developed a whole culture of ethical discussion and debate.

Many of these involved very young children, and included cases of name-calling in the playground and arguments between friends. A growing ‘race relations industry’ has moved into the daily life of schools and even nurseries, with the aim of combating prejudice in children as young as three. But can children so young really be racist in any meaningful sense?\r\n\r\nCritics like Adrian Hart, author of The Myth of Racist Kids, argue that anti-racism campaigns in schools can actually create ethnic tensions. These policies bring officials into the playground: critics argue they stifle childrens relationships with their peers and undermine teachers’ ability to use their own judgement. Others warn against complacency, arguing that society is as racist as ever, and that education is the best means of nipping racist and sexist stereotypes in the bud. Rather than ignoring or minimising playground incidents, we should be vigilant and stamp racism out while individuals are still young and more likely to change their attitudes. Besides, adults have always taught children how to behave and what language is and isn’t acceptable. Isn’t that an important part of a child’s education? \r\n\r\nSo are our schools institutionally racist or confidently multicultural? Should playground name-calling be taken seriously and eliminated, or is it an inevitable and potentially formative part of childhood? Do anti-racist policies just benefit the so-called ‘anti-racism industry’ or do they protect ethnic minorities from prejudice? Should schools and teachers use their own judgment in discriminating between silly name-calling and actual racism, or should they follow official policy to the letter and report every incident, regardless of context?

They have been seen by several in vision, they will awaken the magical instinct everywhere, and the universal heart of the people will turn to the old Druidic beliefs.' The universal heart may have failed to fulfil his prophecy, but this talk considers how Irish mythic gods, the Tuatha Dé Danann, have been envisioned, recreated, and appropriated during the 20th century. Whether re-imagined as personified hermetic forces or symbols of emergent nationalist consciousness, the Tuatha Dé are more familiar now than ever before, appearing in children's literature, eco-protest and neo-paganism.

Just a few years previously a lunar landing would have been consigned to the realms of science-fiction. Who would have thought that under half a century later sub orbital space travel would be available to the general public.\r\n\r\nGoing into space to explore what is unreachable to most humans has been a long lasting dream of humanity. In this fascinating lecture Robert Lainé, CTO of EADS Space, will discuss the current developments and direction of space tourism.\r\n\r\nSpace exploration started just 50 years ago with Gagarin, followed by the moon exploration and then regular orbital flight of astronauts to MIR and the International Space Station. However the dream of going in orbit is not really accessible today to non professional astronauts. Following Space Ship1 flight to 100 km altitude, market analysis have revealed that a significant part of the wealthy population is interested in the sub-orbital flight to experience few minutes of weightlessness and the view of earth from space.  \r\n\r\nThe presentation will give an overview of the logical link between Astrium space activities and space tourism and present the corresponding craft. \r\n\r\nAbout the Speaker \r\nRobert Lainé, Chief Technical Officer, EADS Space\r\n\r\nThe CTO, reporting directly to CEO François Auque, is at the heart of organisation developments. As CTO, Mr Lainé will develop synergies between the satellites and space transportation branches as well as R&D strategy at EADS SPACE level. He has therefore an essential role in preparing the company for the future.\r\n\r\nMr Lainé, of French nationality, has been in the space business since 1970. He has held a variety of senior positions in technical and programme management within industry and at the European Space Agency (ESA), where he led scientific exploration programmes such as the Giotto comet probe and the XMM-Newton space telescope, and spaceflight projects, notably the ATV (Automated Transfer Vehicle) programme for the European cargo vessel that will serve the ISS. Recently, as head of ESA's Launcher Division, he has been a key player in the Ariane 5 return-to-flight programme.\r\n\r\nRobert Lainé holds a degree in engineering from the Ecole Nationale Supérieur d'Electricité Appliquée, Paris.\r\n\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 60, "image_id": null, "added": "2008-02-12T08:08:10", "slug": "94d26690b9f279d3", "speakers": [{"id": 6542, "name": "Robert Lainé", "slug": "robert-lainé"}], "topics": [{"id": 925, "name": "lecture", "path": "/arts/music/classical/lecture"}, {"id": 229, "name": "space", "path": "/science/geology/space"}, {"id": 436, "name": "exploration", "path": "/society/history/exploration"}, {"id": 230, "name": "space", "path": "/science/space"}, {"id": 1150, "name": "adventure", "path": "/leisure/travel/adventure"}, {"id": 660, "name": "innovation", "path": "/business/innovation"}, {"id": 473, "name": "science", "path": "/academic/science"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 1337, "name": "The IET", "slug": "the-iet", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC2R 0BL"}, "organizer": {"id": 1561, "name": "The Institution of Engineering and Technology", "slug": "the-institution-of-engineering-and-technology"}, "date": "2008-03-13", "dates": [{"id": 5415, "from_date": "2008-03-13", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "18:00:00", "ticket_cost": "The lecture is free, however this is a cost associated with dinner", "ticket_info": "You can register online via the website www.theiet.org/kelvin or you can complete a registration form.

The talk will be followed by a response from Dr. Michael Lacewing.\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nPeter Hacker is one of the most powerful contemporary exponents of the linguistic-therapeutic approach to philosophy pioneered by Ludwig Wittgenstein. In this approach, the words and concepts used by the language community are taken as given, and the role of philosophy is to resolve or dissolve philosophical problems by giving an overview of the uses of these words and the structural relationships between these concepts. Philosophical inquiry is therefore very different from scientific inquiry, and Hacker maintains accordingly that there is a sharp dividing line between the two: \"Philosophy is not a contribution to human knowledge, but to human understanding\" (quoted from \"An Orrery of Intentionality\"). \r\n<br>\r\nThis has led him into direct disagreement with \"neuro-philosophers\": neuroscientists or philosophers such as Antonio Damasio and Daniel Dennett who think that neuroscience can shed light on philosophical questions such as the nature of consciousness or the mind-body problem. Hacker maintains that these, like all philosophical problems, are not real problems at all, but mirages arising from conceptual confusion. It follows that scientific inquiry (learning more facts about humans or the world) does not help to resolve them. \r\n<br>\r\nHis 2003 book \"Philosophical Foundations of Neuroscience\", co-authored with neuroscientist M. Bennett, contains an exposition of these views, and critiques of the ideas of many contemporary neuroscientists and philosophers, including Francis Crick, Antonio Damasio, Daniel Dennett, John Searle, and others.\r\n<br>\r\nHacker in general finds many received components of current philosophy of mind to be incoherent. He rejects mind-brain identity theories, as well as functionalism, eliminativism and other forms of reductionism. He advocates methodological pluralism, denying that standard explanations of human conduct are causal, and insisting on the irreducibility of explanation in terms of reasons and goals. He denies that psychological attributes can be intelligibly ascribed to the brain, insisting that they are ascribable only to the human being as a whole. He has endeavoured to show that the puzzles and 'mysteries' of consciousness dissolve under careful analysis of the various forms of intransitive and transitive consciousness, and that so-called 'qualia' are no more than a philosopher's fiction.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nHeady stuff indeed!

But there is another reviver of fairytales, little known in the West, who is deeply intriguing. Božena N&#283;mcová (c.1820–1862) was a feminist, revolutionary and writer who collected fairy tales and folklore from the Bohemian countryside. Now a Czech national heroine, her work is a celebration of folk culture and fantasy, and was deeply influential for the Czechs, giving them a durable form of self-expression. Her writings fortified the sense of Czech cultural identity, and thus fed into the resistance during the 19th and 20th century periods of political oppression. But for all she is a heroine nowadays, in her own lifetime she was much reviled, since she flouted both literary and social conventions – she was too much of a tearaway and a rebel, so was sidelined out of public life. \r\n\r\nTonight, Dr. John Callow looks at some themes from N&#283;mcová’s work and life: invention and uses of folkloric tradition; the vision of the countrywoman and the witch; N&#283;mcová as feminist and political writer.

In the UK Provigil is only available on prescription. But if you could pop a pill, skip a few hours of sleep, and function as normal should you be allowed to? Would you want to?\r\n\r\nA 24-hour lifestyle could have profound implications on both individuals and society.  What would the physiological effects be on the human body? Would we be awake but little more than zombies? Would we have more leisure time?  Or would the working day increase to compensate?  \r\n\r\nSleep is crucial for memory consolidation, creativity and problem solving and the short and long term side effects of sleep-deprivation may be greater than we imagine.  Can these drugs overcome the side effects?\r\n\r\nThe winner of Channel 4’s controversial programme Shattered - Clare Southern - managed to remain awake for an incredible 178 hours. She will be joining sleep experts to share her experiences. \r\n\r\nDirector of the Surrey Sleep Research Centre, Professor Derk-Jan Dijk, and Director of the Loughborough Sleep Research Centre, Professor Jim Horne, will discuss the advent of these new drugs.\r\n\r\n“For centuries caffeine and other pick-me-ups have been used to help stave off sleep.
