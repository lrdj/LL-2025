What are the implications?", "keywords": "marriage, equality, civil partnerships, secular", "body": "Should Civil Partnerships be open to both mixed-sex as well as same-sex couples? What are the implications?\r\n\r\nSince the introduction of the Civil Partnership Act (2004) same sex couples have been able to enter into civil partnerships. The Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013 legalised same sex marriages in England and Wales from March 2014. Since that date, same sex couples, quite rightly, have the option to choose the best legal framework for their own relationship. Mixed sex couple, however, have only the choice of marriage when many couples would prefer to formalise their relationship – and enjoy the security and benefits of a legal partnership – through the formation of a civil partnership.\r\n\r\nRebecca Steinfeld and Charles Keidan have been leading the campaign for Equal Civil Partnerships since 2014 when they were refused a civil partnership at their local registry office. Their determination has seen them go through a legal challenge to the Government as well as lobbying campaign to change the status quo.\r\n\r\nHaving taken the case through the High Court and Appeal Court, Steinfeld and Keidan were finally rewarded in June 2018 at the Supreme Court when the five judges ruled unanimously that the bar to mixed-sex couples entering into civil partnerships breached their rights according the ECHR. However, Government legislation is still needed to change the law. In October 2018, PM Theresa May announced that mixed-sex civil partnerships will be permitted. The fastest way of securing the change in law appears to rest with a Private Members Bill currently in Parliament.\r\n\r\nThe campaign group has benefited from a large and active supporter group. There are over 140,000 signatories on a change.org petition to Women and Equalities Minister, Penny Mordaunt. The campaign costs – both for lobbying and legal fees – are largely funded by supporters through the crowdfunding sites – GoFundMe and CrowdJustice.\r\n\r\nSteinfeld and Keidan will be talking about why this case is so important to them and the long journey they have taken over the last four years.

The Knights Templar soon became powerful and, after only 200 years of existence, came to be seen as a threat. Consequently, they were persecuted, tortured and killed under the orders of King Philip IV of France. The few who survived escaped to Portugal where they were renamed the Order of the Knights of Christ.

", "keywords": "books, politics, ", "body": "We are in the midst of a great revolution. Every century has its revolutions and ours is no exception. It is multi-faceted and interconnected. There is a revolution in science, medicine and technology. The scientific and technological revolution will transform our lives, our work and the world as we know it. Undoubtedly, many of these developments will bring enormous benefits, particularly in the area of human health. However, equally, they could result in the even greater concentration of power and wealth in the hands of the few. The danger is we’ll be deluded by techno-fixes. \r\n\r\nWe are also in the midst of an economic and political revolution. All over the West, Neoliberal economic ideology, austerity, consumerism, free-market capitalism and top down politics are being challenged, especially by younger people. The internet is transforming politics by facilitating dialogue and giving power to people. In the year of the 800th anniversary of Magna Carta, and after an election that gave power to a UK government with only 37% of the votes, there are growing calls for a fair voting system, radical reform of outdated democratic institutions and a different way of doing politics. The story of Syriza in Greece has much in common with Spain's Podemos, Scotland's independence campaign and Jeremy Corbyn’s successful bid to lead and transform the UK Labour party.  These developments, a stagnant economy and mass migration are forcing the EU to rethink itself.\r\n\r\nWe face the biggest challenges in our history. Science and technology will not help us unless we are determined to act on the urgent need to tackle climate chaos, conserve a living planet, resolve economic inequality and break entrenched power structures. As I write, Cop 21, the 21st annual session of the International Climate Change Conference, is to be held in Paris, 30 November to 11 December 2015. Will the necessary action be finally agreed and acted upon in time to prevent catastrophe? Will we learn to live lightly on the planet? Will we learn to collaborate and resolve conflict without war?  Like all species, human beings are evolving. But will we do so in time?\r\n\r\nThe greatest obstacles, argues Dixon, are the lack of farsighted, courageous leaders who will speak the truth and disempowered citizens who think there is nothing they can do. Hence the subtitle of this book – A Call to Greatness.\r\n\r\nThis accessible book will help you make sense of the situation. It offers ways forward and practical solutions. It will help you decide how you want to engage with others in creating a better world through a peaceful revolution.

A drinks reception will follow this lecture.\r\n\r\nTitle: The Inexorable Rise of AI, Social Machines and the Data Deluge\r\n\r\nAbstract: We live in an age of superabundant information and the power of computers increases exponentially.\r\n\r\nThe power of computers has led to systems such as Watson and companies such as Deep Mind which raise questions about the emergence of artificial intelligence. What is the reality and what do we know about making smart software?\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the Internet and World Wide Web have transformed our lives. However, our understanding of these systems when used by millions globally is still in its infancy. What are the insights that studying these Social Machines provide to help us understand the evolving Web of the 21st Century?\r\n\r\nOpen data published on the Web is improving the efficiency of our public services and giving rise to open innovation. Data collected at scale by public and private agencies also gives rise to concerns about its use and abuse. This data deluge also presents challenges.\r\n\r\nThis lecture will discuss these fast moving developments and how they complement each other.\r\n\r\nBiography: Sir Nigel Shadbolt is Professor of Computer Science at the University of Oxford and Principal of Jesus College. He is also the Chairman and Co-Founder of the Open Data Institute (ODI). Since 2009, Sir Nigel has acted as an Information Adviser to the UK Government, helping transform public access to Government information, including the widely acclaimed data.gov.uk site.\r\n\r\nWith over 500 publications he researches and publishes on computer science, artificial intelligence, open data and web science. During his career, he has also worked in philosophy, psychology and linguistics. Since 2000 he has secured 17 projects as Principal Investigator with a value of over £20 million pounds. He is currently Principal Investigator on a £6.14M EPSRC funded Programme Grant researching the theory of social machines - Web scale problem solving systems comprising large numbers of humans and computers. \r\n\r\nIn 2006 he was one of three founding Directors of Garlik Ltd, which in 2008 was awarded Technology Pioneer status by the Davos World Economic Forum and won the prestigious UK national BT Flagship Award.  Garlik was acquired by Experian Ltd in 2011.  In 2013 he was awarded a Knighthood for services to science and engineering. \r\n\r\nAll are welcome and attendance is free.

Drawing on experience from his privileged position, Lin offers unique reflections on the cause of the crisis, why it was so serious and widespread, and its likely evolution. Arguing that conventional theories provide inadequate solutions, he proposes new initiatives for achieving global stability and avoiding the recurrence of similar crises in the future. He suggests that the crisis and the global imbalances both originated with the excess liquidity created by US financial deregulation and loose monetary policy, and recommends the creation of a global Marshall Plan and a new supranational global reserve currency. \r\n\r\nJustin Lin is professor and honorary dean at the National School of Development at Peking University. He was the senior vice president and chief economist of the World Bank from 2008-2012. Prior to joining the Bank, Professor Lin served for 15 years as founding director and professor of the China Centre for Economic Research (CCER) at Peking University and is the author of 24 books including T'he Quest for Prosperity: How Developing Economies Can Take Off', 'New Structural Economics: A Framework for Rethinking Development and Policy', 'Demystifying the Chinese Economy', 'Benti and Changwu: Dialogues on Methodology in Economics', and 'Economic Development and Transition: Thought, Strategy, and Viability'. \r\n\r\nHe is a member of the Standing Committee and vice chairman of the Economic Council, Chinese People’s Political Consultation Conference. He was vice chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce. He served on several national and international committees, leading groups, and councils on development policy, technology, and environment including: Eminent Persons Council of the World Bank, International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) Steering Committee, the UN Millennium Task Force on Hunger; the Eminent Persons Group of the Asian Development Bank; the National Committee on United States-China Relations; the Global Agenda Council on the International Monetary System; Reinventing Bretton Woods Committee; and the Hong Kong-U.S. Business Council. He received honorary doctoral degrees from Universite D’Auvergne, Fordham University, Nottingham University, City University of Hong Kong, London School of Economics, and Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, and is a Corresponding Fellow of the British Academy and a Fellow of the Academy of Sciences for Developing World.   \r\n\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 732, "added": "2013-05-28T14:57:26", "slug": "dd8ac8b24035f322", "speakers": [{"id": 12913, "name": "Professor  Justin  Lin", "slug": "professor-justin-lin"}], "topics": [{"id": 2971, "name": "recession", "path": "/academic/economics/economicrecession/recession"}, {"id": 415, "name": "economics", "path": "/society/politics/economics"}], "supercategory": "academic", "venue": {"id": 1515, "name": "Old Theatre, Old Building", "slug": "old-theatre-old-building", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC2A 2AE"}, "organizer": {"id": 1287, "name": "London School of Economics & Political Science", "slug": "london-school-of-economics-political-science"}, "date": "2013-06-24", "dates": [{"id": 13094, "from_date": "2013-06-24", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "18:30:00", "ticket_cost": "FREE", "ticket_info": "This event is free and open to all with no ticket required.

After learning all he could from imported prints and books he resolved to cross the Alps to study Italian art at first hand. Rather than travelling to Florence or Rome, Dürer stopped and stayed in Venice. On his arrival, Venetian artists received him with great honour but with some jealousy. The technical brilliance of his graphic work had made a big impact in Italy, yet his paintings were said to lack such qualities as the deep, rich colour for which Venetian art was renowned. Dürer was determined to ‘stop the mouths’ of his critics before returning to effect a revolution, a ‘renaissance’ in the arts in Germany. Close links between Venice and Germany had been long established and this course will examine this direct cultural cross-fertilisation, focusing on works Dürer produced in Italy under the inspiration of Giovanni Bellini, Giorgione and others, together with the influence Dürer’s work had upon them.

This long-awaited third and final volume of his definitive narrative of Nazi Germany and the Second World war, concludes Richard J Evans’ uniquely comprehensive and yet intimate account of the beliefs, experiences and fate of the German nation and its people in the early years of the twentieth century.\r\n\r\nThe Third Reich at War traces the rise and fall of German military might against the background of the mobilization of the ‘people’s community’ in the service of a war of conquest, racial subjugation and genocide. Interweaving a broad narrative of the war’s progress with personal testimony from a wide range of people, from generals to front-line soldiers, from Hitler Youth activists to middle-class housewives, Richard Evans lays bare the dynamics of a society plunged into war at every level. The great battles and events of the war are here, from the Battle of Stalingrad to Hitler’s suicide in the bunker, but just as important is the recreation of the daily experience of ordinary Germans in wartime, under the growing impact of the mass bombing of Germany’s towns and cities. At the centre of the book is the Nazi extermination of Europe’s Jews, set in the context of Hitler’s genocidal plans for the racial restructuring of Europe.\r\n\r\nRichard J Evans is Professor of Modern History at Cambridge University, and will take up the position of Regius Professor of Modern History at the University in October. His previous books include In Defence of History, Telling Lies about Hitler and the companions to this title, The Coming of the Third Reich and The Third Reich in Power. \r\n\r\nThe Space for Thought Lecture series celebrates the completion of the New Academic Building and is supported by the LSE Annual Fund.

Some have already been lost forever.

We are used to conserving species by introducing or increasing protection measures of the animals and/or their habitats. Diseases respect neither the law nor protected areas. In fact, many of the most devastating effects of chytridiomycosis have occurred in unspoilt and protected areas, such as rain forest reserves in Australia and Central America.\r\n\r\nAlthough chytridiomycosis can be treated with antifungal medications, it is both impractical and ecologically dangerous to attempt such treatments in the wild. Currently, our only defense is to bring vulnerable species into captivity until alternative approaches are devised. This is a massive challenge to the zoo and conservation research community.\r\n\r\nIf we are to avoid losing the world's amphibian biodiversity in the face of this daunting threat, zoos and other conservation organisations need to raise their game to a new level of cooperation along the lines of a Manhattan project-style response for amphibian conservation.\r\n\r\nOrganised by Dr Andrew Cunningham, Institute of Zoology, ZSL", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 578, "added": "2007-05-16T11:56:48", "slug": "global-amphibian-declines", "speakers": [{"id": 5519, "name": "Dr Andrew A Cunningham, Institute of Zoology, ZSL, London", "slug": "dr-andrew-a-cunningham-institute-of-zoology-zsl-london"}, {"id": 5521, "name": "Dr Jaime Bosch, Museo Nacional de Ciencias Naturales , CSIC, Madrid, Spain", "slug": "dr-jaime-bosch-museo-nacional-de-ciencias-naturales-csic-madrid-spain"}, {"id": 5523, "name": "Kevin R.

The largest and most diverse group of these modern dialects is the North Eastern group, which is generally known as North Eastern Neo-Aramaic (NENA). This consists of dialects spoken by Christian and Jewish communities across a wide area encompassing northern Iraq, north-west Iran, south-eastern Turkey, Armenia and Georgia. The Christian dialects in all cases differ from the Jewish dialects, even where the Christians and Jews lived in the same town or region. In this dialect group radical changes have taken place in the verbal system in comparison with earlier forms of Aramaic.\r\n\r\nOne of the most conspicuous changes is the acquisition of ergative inflection in the past perfective forms of the verb. This feature developed through contact with Iranian languages, especially the Kurdish dialects, which have, or have had at some stage in their history, ergative syntax in the past forms of verbs. In many respects, however, the ergative construction has developed with a life of its own in NENA in a way that differs from its development in the modern Iranian dialects. There is, furthermore, considerable diversity across the dialect group regarding the way the ergative has developed. Three stages of development are discernible: (1) dialects in which the ergative inflection occurs on past perfective verbs that are high in transitivity due to their having an agent or agent-like argument and punctual–dynamic actionality by virtue of their lexical meaning. (2) dialects in which ergative inflection is generalized to the expression of all actions that are presented by the speaker with past perfective dynamic aspect irrespective of the existence of agent properties in one of the arguments. (3) dialects in which the ergative inflection has been generalized to the expression of all actions that are presented with past perfective aspect irrespective of dynamicity.\r\n\r\nThe verbal system of the dialect group has also acquired numerous clitic particles, which have evolved from finite auxiliary verbal forms. The function of these particles has undergone considerable diachronic change. Particles that now express the habitual aspect, for example, have developed either from particles that originally expressed the progressive or from those that originally expressed the future.\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": null, "added": "2007-01-24T04:22:39", "slug": "some-aspects-of-verb-morphology-and-syntax-in-modern-aramaic", "speakers": [{"id": 4554, "name": "Professor Geoffrey Khan", "slug": "professor-geoffrey-khan"}], "topics": [{"id": 862, "name": "language", "path": "/academic/arts/english/language"}, {"id": 741, "name": "morphology", "path": "/academic/arts/linguistics/morphology"}, {"id": 579, "name": "arabic", "path": "/academic/language/arabic"}, {"id": 3, "name": "linguistics", "path": "/academic/arts/linguistics"}, {"id": 1, "name": "academic", "path": "/academic"}, {"id": 1062, "name": "aramaic", "path": "/academic/languages/aramaic"}, {"id": 1062, "name": "aramaic", "path": "/academic/languages/aramaic"}], "supercategory": "academic", "venue": {"id": 1152, "name": "Room GR 06-07, English Faculty Building", "slug": "room-gr-06-07-english-faculty-building", "city": "Cambridge", "postcode": "CB3 9DP"}, "organizer": {"id": 1122, "name": "Cambridge University Linguistic Society, University of Cambridge", "slug": "cambridge-university-linguistic-society-university-of-cambridge"}, "date": "2007-01-25", "dates": [{"id": 3756, "from_date": "2007-01-25", "to_date": "2007-01-25", "time": "17:00:00", "ticket_cost": "Membership in the Linguistic Society is £6 a year or £5 for students.", "ticket_info": null, "additional_info": "Cambridge University Linguistic Society aims to bring together people with an interest in language.
