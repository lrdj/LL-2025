But why has the appearance and behaviour of ghosts in art and literature altered over time? When did they stop wearing shrouds and put on white sheets or become see-through? And what do these changes reveal about them – and us?\r\n\r\nDr. Susan Owens, former Curator of Paintings at the Victoria and Albert Museum, is the author of The Ghost: A Cultural History.\r\n\r\nBond's Black Ops - Graham Green, Papa Doc and Loa OS 22\r\n\r\nJohn Cussans, author of 'Undead Uprising: Haiti, Horror and the Zombie Complex' examines the story of Papa Doc, François Duvalier: President of Haiti from 1957 to 1971, emulated the Vodou loa of the dead Baron Samedi, a tale first promoted by Graham Greene that finds an uncanny precedent in Ian Flemming's 1954 novel Live and Let Die.\r\n\r\nThomas Morris - Diagnosis: Unexplained\r\nEarly medical journals contain numerous cases which appear inexplicable to modern science.

With a chequered history of Roman occupation, Chartist uprisings, and as a critically important sea port and railway town Newport has quickly developed to meet the expansion of economic and industrial heartlands of Wales. Newport is well described as a haven of modern Britain with its exotic mix of settlers of Welsh, Irish, English, Italian, Arab and Asian origins, and it is certainly one of the most lively multi-cultural and cosmopolitan cities of the country.\r\nThe town’s allegiance to the British monarchy has had its troubled past. As late as Queen Victoria’s Jubilee of 1897 the residents of Newport were only lurkwarm in their celebrations. However the succession of 20th century Princes of Wales have all found more love and interest created by their actions and high public profiles with more affection shown for them in Wales across religions, creeds and classes. The charismatic Edward, Prince of Wales was widely welcomed in Newport in 1921 when he rode on the town’s famous Transporter Bridge. In 1937 the new King George VI and Queen Elizabeth visited Newport to much praise and public cheering. After the Second World War several members of the Royal family passed through Newport and received a good Welsh welcome. It has not just been Royals who have given Newport the pleasure of a visit, many VIPS from all walks of life , politicians, Prime Ministers, stars of stage, screen and TV have also appeared in the town ( now a City).

Socrates relates that Diotima describes philosophy as a path of love and cognitive ascent. In this session we will consider Diotima’s speech and its implications for philosophy. Why does Diotima connect philosophy with love, desire and beauty? How does her speech relate philosophy and the search for wisdom to our relationship with other human beings and the world around us? Why does Socrates relate Diotima’s teaching rather than making his own speech on the nature of love (or er&#333;s)?

Among the victims of this plan were the 20,000 to 50,000 Bosniak women and girls – as young as 12 – who were subjected to sexual violence.

These may also be used as meditational practices, which, once made familiar, can be seen throughout all the works of Plato, Parmenides, Plotinus, Aristotle, and many others.  Indeed as Porphyry wrote, \"Beatific contemplation does not consist of the accumulation of arguments or a storehouse of learned knowledge, but in us theory must become nature and life itself.\"\r\n\r\nThese living excellences are so fundamental, that they can be seen not only as essential to aid to the understanding of the individual, but also to the individual development, as well as integral to the human social structure, as Plato shows in his Republic and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nOver this session and another a month later (on May 16th) we will look at this subject using an extract from the Auxiliaries to the Perception of Intelligible Natures by Porphyry (circa 233 – 305 c.e.) This philosopher, a Phoenician of royal descent, was born in Tyre (in modern day Lebanon) but who traveled to Rome to study under Plotinus to whom he became attached as a disciple and confidant. It is thanks to him that we have the inspired speeches of Plotinus, as he recorded and arranged them into the Enneads we have today.\r\n\r\nThe evening will consist of a brief introduction to the subject and its place in the Platonic tradition, a reading of an extract from Porphyry's text, and then an open discussion amongst those present about the ideas being put forward by Porphyry.\r\n\r\nNo previous experience of formal philosophy is required.\r\n\r\nEntrance in free, but donations between £3-5 will be welcomed.\r\n\r\nA PDF download of the extract we will be reading is available on our website together with further details of this and other Prometheus Trust's activities: www.prometheustrust.co.uk (the PDF is on the \"London Monday Evenings\" page.)\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 2426, "added": "2016-03-30T14:35:56", "slug": "porphyry-on-arete-virtue-or-excellence", "speakers": [{"id": 16087, "name": "Peter Lyle", "slug": "peter-lyle"}], "topics": [{"id": 3310, "name": "mythology", "path": "/religion/spirituality/spiritualdevelopment/mythology"}, {"id": 1822, "name": "philosophy", "path": "/academic/religion/religion/philosophy"}, {"id": 2388, "name": "philosophy", "path": "/arts/literature/philosophy/philosophy"}, {"id": 365, "name": "platonism", "path": "/arts/philosophy/platonism"}], "supercategory": "religion", "venue": {"id": 3106, "name": "Cecil Sharp House", "slug": "cecil-sharp-house", "city": "London", "postcode": "NW1 7AY"}, "organizer": {"id": 2041, "name": "The Prometheus Trust", "slug": "the-prometheus-trust"}, "date": "2016-04-18", "dates": [{"id": 15821, "from_date": "2016-04-18", "to_date": "2016-04-18", "time": "19:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Donation", "ticket_info": null, "additional_info": "No need to book ahead but further info from education@prometheustrust.co.uk", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 3106, "name": "Cecil Sharp House", "slug": "cecil-sharp-house", "city": "London", "postcode": "NW1 7AY"}, "organizer": {"id": 2041, "name": "The Prometheus Trust", "slug": "the-prometheus-trust"}}]}, {"id": 15250, "title": "The Carnarvons of  Highclere Castle", "synopsis": "An illustrated talk by William Cross, FSA Scot giving an overview of all the past 8 Earls of Carnarvon and their respective Countesses of Highclere Castle, Hampshire, stretching from 1793 until the present day.

From sheltering Jewish refugees from genocide in World War Two, this book explores how the multicultural and multi faith Albanian community was attacked by the Communist Party between 1944 and 1991 in order to create a homogenous and violently policed atheist state. This work is a contribution to the field of genocide studies as it explores the persecution of racial and ethnic groups in the context of Enver Hoxha’s unique application of socialist political ideology. Through following the life stories of six individuals, Life is War uses oral history to bring the reader into the homes and memories of those who survived Albanian communist persecution. Dr Woodcock will speak about ethnic and racial persecution within the uniquely isolated and oppressive Albanian communist state. This period in Albanian history (1946 –1991) is framed by the Holocaust and the Yugoslav wars, and provides the missing link in terms of genocide studies and history between World War Two, when the Albanian community famously sheltered and protected Jewish refugees from Europe, and the 1990s, when the Albanian community of Kosovo was the target of Milosevic’s genocidal “Operation Horseshoe.” Life is War explores how racial concepts and stereotypes, alongside gendered stereotypes, were vital to the organisation of the communist state.\r\n\r\nDr Shannon Woodcock is a genocide scholar who has held the Pearl Resnick Post-Doctoral Fellowship at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and published widely in the field of the Holocaust of Romani people in Romania.

The programme will touch on themes such as contexts of art practice, self-censorship, contemporary psychoanalysis, and the wider concerns of how we live together.\r\n\r\nCally Spooner | 25 November | 7 - 8.30pm\r\nIn her talk Cally will be exploring the idea of a usurped voice; the transferral of the voice from a live body to a technical body, and the hire body as a technology.\r\n\r\nBiography\r\nCally Spooner is a British-born (b.1983) London-based artist and writer. Drawing from pop music, current affairs, corporate rhetoric and philosophical writing, Spooner’s projects address automated behaviour, outsourced subjectivity, mutated human resources and the short-circuiting of language in today’s attention economies. Appropriating different performance genres such as the musical, the television commercial and the radio play as both forms and a reference, Spooner considers how the extreme visibility of entertainment sits in relation to dematerialized, indeterminate and unmediated performance, and to the movement and behaviour of speech. Following her large-scale touring musical And You Were Wonderful, On Stage (2013)—commissioned and presented by Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam; Performa 13, New York; and Tate Modern, London—Spooner is currently producing a film based on the musical that will be made at EMPAC, New York, in 2015. This work follows on from Spooner's Frieze Sounds commission at Frieze New York, and will be produced in partnership with High Line Art, New York. Future projects also include a presentation for the Future Generation Art Prize, and a solo exhibition at gb agency, Paris (all 2014).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTickets:\r\nSingle talk £6 | £4 freelance and concession\r\n3-talk cards £16.50 | £10.50 freelance and concession\r\n\r\nDrinks Offer: Free drinks voucher for the first 20 people who book for any talk \r\n\r\nTo book, please call 020 7091 9650 or email info@independentdance.co.uk\r\n\r\nVenue:\r\nIndependent Dance\r\nSiobhan Davies Studios \r\n85 St. Georges Road\r\nLondon\r\nSE1 6ER", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 1768, "added": "2014-11-19T10:40:12", "slug": "837d45e92575d593", "speakers": [{"id": 15232, "name": "Cally Spooner", "slug": "cally-spooner"}], "topics": [{"id": 2676, "name": "dance", "path": "/arts/arts/education/dance"}, {"id": 1869, "name": "performance", "path": "/arts/film/videoart/performance"}, {"id": 3399, "name": "performance", "path": "/arts/art/contemporaryart/performance"}, {"id": 1018, "name": "talk", "path": "/arts/education/debate/talk"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 1781, "name": "Independent Dance", "slug": "independent-dance", "city": "London", "postcode": "SE1 6ER"}, "organizer": {"id": 1781, "name": "Independent Dance", "slug": "independent-dance"}, "date": "2014-11-25", "dates": [{"id": 14836, "from_date": "2014-11-25", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "19:00:00", "ticket_cost": "£4-£6", "ticket_info": "Please call Siobhan Davies reception on 020 7091 9650 or email info@independentdance.co.uk.", "additional_info": null, "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 1781, "name": "Independent Dance", "slug": "independent-dance", "city": "London", "postcode": "SE1 6ER"}, "organizer": {"id": 1781, "name": "Independent Dance", "slug": "independent-dance"}}]}, {"id": 14120, "title": "King's Arts & Humanities Festival 2014", "synopsis": "The King’s Arts & Humanities Festival is back for a sixth year, offering dozens of free talks, workshops and performances exploring music, literature, philosophy, politics, history and religion and much more.

By examining over 30 novels, short stories and autobiographies set in London since the Second World War, Murray investigates the complex psychological landscapes of belonging and cultural allegiance found in these unique and intensely personal perspectives on the Irish experience of migration. As well as bringing new research to bear on the work of established Irish writers, this study reveals a fascinating and hitherto unexplored literature, diverse in form and content.\r\n\r\nAmong the works studied in Murray’s book is John Healy’s unflinchingly honest autobiography ‘The Grass Arena’, in which he describes his experiences of addiction, his escape through learning to play chess in prison, and his ongoing search for peace of mind. It won the 1989 J. R. Ackerley Prize for Autobiography and is now published as a Penguin Classic.\r\n\r\nHealy recounts his fifteen years living rough in London without state aid, when begging carried an automatic three-year prison sentence and vagrant alcoholics prowled the parks and streets in search of drink or prey.

The Innovation Economy begins with discovery and culminates in speculation. Over some 250 years, economic growth has been driven by successive processes of trial and error: upstream exercises in research and invention, and downstream experiments in exploiting the new economic space opened by innovation. Drawing on his professional experiences, William H. Janeway provides an accessible pathway for readers to appreciate the dynamics of the Innovation Economy. He combines personal reflections, from a career spanning forty years in venture capital, with the development of an original theory of the role of asset bubbles in financing technological innovation and of the role of the state in playing an enabling role in the innovation process. Today, with the state frozen as an economic actor and access to the public equity markets only open to a minority, the Innovation Economy is stalled; learning the lessons from this book will contribute to its renewal. \r\n\r\nWilliam H. Janeway has lived a double life of \"theorist-practitioner,\" according to the legendary economist Hyman Minsky who first applied that term to him twenty-five years ago. In his role as \"practitioner,\" Bill Janeway has been an active venture capital investor for more than 40 years. During that time he built and led the Warburg Pincus Technology Investment team that provided financial backing to a series of companies making critical contributions to the internet economy, including BEA Systems, Veritas Software and, more recently, Nuance Communications, the speech recognition company. He remains actively engaged as a Senior Advisor and Managing Director at Warburg Pincus. \r\n\r\nAs a \"theorist,\" Janeway received a Ph.D in Economics from Cambridge University where he was a Marshall Scholar. His doctoral study on the formulation of economic policy following the Great Crash of 1929 was supervised by Keynes' leading student, Richard Kahn (author of the foundational paper on \"the multiplier\"). Janeway went on to found the Cambridge Endowment for Research in Finance. Currently he serves as a Teaching Visitor at the Princeton University Economics Department and Visiting Scholar in the Economics Faculty of Cambridge University. \r\n\r\nJaneway is a director of Magnet Systems, Nuance Communications, O'Reilly Media and a member of the Board of Managers of Roubini Global Economics. He is a member of the board of directors of the Social Science Research Council, and a co-founder and member of the Governing Board of the Institute for New Economic Thinking (INET). \r\n\r\nMr Janeway will be signing copies of his book, which will be available for sale with a 20% discount on the night. \r\n\r\nDimitri Vayanos is Professor of Finance and Director of the Paul Woolley Centre for the Study of Capital Market Dysfunctionality at LSE. \r\n\r\nSuggested hashtag for this event for Twitter users: #LSEJaneway ", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 732, "added": "2012-09-14T17:22:18", "slug": "0e06b5527036e5ae", "speakers": [{"id": 12821, "name": "Dr William H Janeway", "slug": "dr-william-h-janeway"}, {"id": 12822, "name": "Discussant Professor Dimitri  Vayanos", "slug": "discussant-professor-dimitri-vayanos"}, {"id": 12817, "name": "Professor Craig Calhoun  ", "slug": "professor-craig-calhoun"}], "topics": [{"id": 2251, "name": "economy", "path": "/academic/history/usa/coldwar/economy"}, {"id": 3025, "name": "capitalism", "path": "/academic/economic/welfare/capitalism"}, {"id": 1640, "name": "economy", "path": "/society/media/news/economy"}], "supercategory": "academic", "venue": {"id": 2152, "name": "Sheikh Zayed Theatre, New Academic Building", "slug": "sheikh-zayed-theatre-new-academic-building", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC2A 2AE"}, "organizer": {"id": 1287, "name": "London School of Economics & Political Science", "slug": "london-school-of-economics-political-science"}, "date": "2012-10-11", "dates": [{"id": 11924, "from_date": "2012-10-11", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "18:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": "This event is free and open to all however a ticket is required, only one ticket per person can be requested. \r\n\r\nMembers of the public, LSE staff, students and alumni can request one ticket via the online ticket request form which will be live on this listing after 10pm on Thursday 4 October until at least 12noon on Friday 5 October.

He shows how moving money from the middle and bottom of society to the top, far from stimulating entrepreneurship actually produces slower growth and lower GDP with even more instability. Redistributing wealth from the very rich would produce far greater gains overall in our economies than the rich would lose. \r\n\r\nJoseph Stiglitz was Chief Economist at the World Bank until January 2000. He is currently University Professor of the Columbia Business School and Chair of the Management Board and Director of Graduate Summer Programs, Brooks World Poverty Institute, University of Manchester.

By working with the 'givens' of human-nature, and ensuring that knowledge of how people really function is applied intelligently to teenagers, he shows how you can speed up progress and bring them real benefits.  You will find yourself more empowered to respond effectively to each individual's needs, temperament and learning style whilst avoiding the emotional pitfalls of working in stressful situations.", "additional_info": null, "duration": 480, "image_id": null, "added": "2011-12-07T08:05:15", "slug": "69218e6b02f60053", "speakers": [{"id": 9560, "name": "Richard Brook", "slug": "richard-brook"}], "topics": [{"id": 1576, "name": "development", "path": "/society/media/media/development"}, {"id": 148, "name": "psychology", "path": "/science/psychology"}, {"id": 2491, "name": "development", "path": "/society/gender/feminism/development"}, {"id": 375, "name": "development", "path": "/science/psychology/development"}, {"id": 149, "name": "brain", "path": "/science/psychology/brain"}, {"id": 318, "name": "insight", "path": "/science/psychology/insight"}], "supercategory": "society", "venue": {"id": 2604, "name": "Woodbrooke Quaker Study Centre", "slug": "woodbrooke-quaker-study-centre", "city": "Birmingham", "postcode": "B29 6LJ"}, "organizer": {"id": 2602, "name": "Human Givens College", "slug": "human-givens-college"}, "date": "2012-05-02", "dates": [{"id": 10882, "from_date": "2012-05-02", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "9:30:00", "ticket_cost": "£192.00", "ticket_info": "Human Givens College\r\nwww.humangivenscollege.com\r\n01323 811690", "additional_info": null, "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 2604, "name": "Woodbrooke Quaker Study Centre", "slug": "woodbrooke-quaker-study-centre", "city": "Birmingham", "postcode": "B29 6LJ"}, "organizer": {"id": 2602, "name": "Human Givens College", "slug": "human-givens-college"}}]}, {"id": 10431, "title": "Standard setting and maintaining using expert judgement", "synopsis": "This session will look at the role of expert judgement in standard setting and maintaining, the methods used for capturing expert judgements.", "keywords": "Assessment\r\nQualifications\r\nEducation", "body": "A look at a fundamental issue in assessment.

A prophet is usually understood to be a person who, inspired by supernatural agency, speaks on behalf of that agent and predicts the future. But Bentham himself pointed out that the original Greek meaning of the term referred simply to a person who ‘speaks out’, and in a more limited extent to a person who ‘foretells’.\r\n\r\nIn opposition to the prevailing mores of his day, Bentham proposed that all sexual activity that was consensual—whether with oneself, whether with partners of the same or the opposite sex, whether with partners of different species—should be made free from legislative interference. In the post-Malthusian age, non-prolific modes of sexual activity were rather to be welcomed than condemned. In short, Bentham saw sexual morality as a key battleground in the fight to divorce morality and legislation from the influence of religion. The thousands of manuscripts on homosexuality, Christian teachings and the influence of the church on the state that Bentham was reluctant to publish during his lifetime reveal that his thoughts were certainly well ahead of his time, and seemingly foretell the development of secular attitudes to sexual morality.\r\n\r\nThis is a remarkable opportunity to hear a world renowned expert discuss one of Britain’s greatest thinkers and will fascinate those interested in secularism, liberalism and the history of ideas.

His Orwell: The Life won the Whitbread Biography of the year for 2003.

He is married with three children and lives in Norwich.  His latest book Bright Young People, which he will be discussing during this event, is both a chronicle of England’s ‘lost generation’ of the Jazz Age, and a panoramic portrait of a world that could accommodate both dizzying success and paralysing failure. Drawing on the writings and reminiscences of the Bright Young People themselves, D.J. Taylor has produced an enthralling social and cultural history, a definitive portrait of a vanished age.\r\n\r\nThis event is supported by the Royal Society of Literature.

Everyone welcome.\r\n\r\nPaths to life-extension. Scenario planning with Anders Sandberg\r\n\r\nWhat would be the social impact of different development paths to life-extension? We could experience a sudden breakthrough, or a slower development. Advancements could be based on complex and expensive medical services, genetic interventions or novel pharmaceutical agents. Do we need a state-sponsored \"war on ageing\", or will the private sector drive progress in this area? Will life-extension come to be regarded as enhancement, as opposed to therapy? Will there be organised opposition to these developments? Will there be organised support? After an introduction to the basics of scenario planning, Anders Sandberg will lead an informal scenario session exploring these topics.\r\n\r\nWe will be at the Penderel's Oak from 12.30pm for lunch and conversation and will move to Conway Hall at 2pm.

Is New Labour still relevant today, or does Labour need to find a different way of articulating its purpose? \r\n\r\nAnthony Giddens was director of LSE from 1997 to 2003 and is now emeritus professor of LSE and a life peer. Neil Kinnock was leader of the opposition and Labour Party leader from 1983 to 1992 and served as a UK commissioner of the European Commission from 1995 until 2004.

Talks Programme\r\n\r\nThe Institut français has a varied programme of talks, giving a wide range of speakers the opportunity to express themselves freely and enter into a dialogue with the public.
