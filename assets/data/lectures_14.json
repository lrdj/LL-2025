Her research interests include the prevention of HIV transmission, and she has been involved in initiatives that have resulted in a significant reduction in HIV diagnoses in men who have sex with men in London. She is also interested in the sexual and reproductive health of women, and particularly HIV positive women. She is a passionate advocate for women’s access to HIV prevention strategies including HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). \r\n\r\nDr Nwokolo will argue that the end of AIDS could be within reach, but success lies in our hands. \r\n\r\nProgramme\r\n6pm - Arrival refreshments (tea and coffee)\r\n6.30pm -  Lecture starts\r\n7.30pm -  Lecture finishes\r\n\r\nSpaces at this event and the others in the 500th series are strictly limited and we anticipate them booking out well in advance.

They  built up the Herbert family, their  lives   tower over their  men folk  for spark,  personal strengths,  and  surprising,  compelling  stories of their origins  & achievements. \r\n\r\nThese interesting women stand out  to form  a lasting legacy of their own  when recounting  how they ran  Highclere  as  the Earl’s wife, mother to the Earl’s children, the  house  chatelaine  ( managing dozens of servants) ,  and a busy hostess charged with receiving and entertaining VIPs of the era.\r\n\r\nBetween 1793 and 1939   the period of the  First to the  Sixth  Countesses of Carnarvon  the eight remarkable woman who held  the title make a quixotic mix. The first three Countesses  in succession Elizabeth, Kitty and Henrietta were wealthy heiresses  drawn from some of the great peerage families of England, including the  Wyndhams, Acland and Howard nobility (the last mentioned had links to the Dukes of Norfolk).  The 4th Countess Evelyn Stanhope was an Earl’s daughter, a Royal Courtier,  energetic horse woman and  dynamic political hostess but  who died young. She was followed by another member of the  Howard clan,  Elsie,  a smart,  hedonistic woman who strangled Herbert history by  the deletion of  large chunks of her husband’s  (the 4th Earl’s) diaries   in order to suppress  the true nature of his relationship with his eldest son and heir and hide the horrific evidence of scandal,   family flaws and bad genes.   Next came the ‘Pocket Venus’,  Almina Wombwell,  the petite, cunning,   5th Countess who added  more wealth from out of  the Rothschild banking family.  Almina was misled  and frustrated by a perverted spouse ( a man who later claimed fame as the discoverer of Tutankhamun).  The 5th  Earl brought in surrogacy arrangements and ditched the Herbert bloodline in favour of a dangerous adage to  the gene pool from his best friend, an Indian Prince.   Rumours were rife. Lies were lavishly told.  Money was  paid  to keep  secrets subdued. History was altered.  On a higher level Almina became a  pioneering nurse in the Great  War, later  matron   at a series of plush nursing homes  and beyond this she  was the longest lived of the Carnarvon women. \r\n\r\nThe first of the two Sixth Countesses Catherine Wendell was a glamorous American who grew up in England, she was popular with Highclere staff but  badly treated,  sacrificed  and humiliated by her womanising husband, Porchey,  a  bullying sex pest. Catherine turned to drink, she eventually found love, with affairs with several high placed men including the musician, Malcolm Sargent.  Then came Tilly Losch ,  the second  6th Countess, an Austrian Jewess, talented  ballet dancer ( famous for her ‘ Dance of  Hands’ routine)  and a film and stage star sought temporary safety as war loomed by marriage to the 6th Earl  in 1939.  Hers was the shortest tenure  as  Highclere Castle’s chatelaine,  just ten weeks before she fled to the USA.  In America  Tilly had once been a Holywood figure in her early days, and a limelight act on the London stage  working with the legendry Noel Coward and Cocky Cochran in  the late 1920s and Fred Astaire in New York in the early 1930s.  Tilly used  her sexual favours  to lure men and women into her bed.  She kept a score card of those who were caught up in her web. \r\n\r\nWilliam Cross,  FSA Scot the author of six books on the Herberts of Highclere offers an entertaining insight into these eight  women whose like we shall never see again. \r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 2249, "added": "2017-03-10T12:29:27", "slug": "the-chatelaines-of-highclere-castle-heiresses-hedonists-and-hookers", "speakers": [{"id": 13766, "name": "Mr William  Cross", "slug": "mr-william-cross"}], "topics": [{"id": 1690, "name": "family", "path": "/society/history/family"}], "supercategory": "society", "venue": {"id": 3165, "name": "Newport Hard of Hearing Club", "slug": "newport-hard-of-hearing-club", "city": "Newport", "postcode": "NP20 1HG"}, "organizer": {"id": 2861, "name": "William Cross, FSA Scot", "slug": "william-cross-fsa-scot"}, "date": "2017-04-19", "dates": [{"id": 16356, "from_date": "2017-04-19", "to_date": "2017-04-19", "time": "14:00:00", "ticket_cost": "Members and Guests", "ticket_info": "See Club Secretary", "additional_info": "William Cross,  FSA Scot is the author of six books on the Herberts of Highclere CAstle.

The beginnings of the Royal Flying Corps will then be covered with its two wings, military and naval, which at first operated together as a joint force. The effects of the war in confirming an increasing autonomy for each wing will be explained as will the activities of the Naval Wing in 1914, that had little to do with naval warfare.

With Professors David Reynolds, Chris Clark and Dr Joya Chatterjee.\r\n\r\nTHE BALKANS AND THE LEGACIES OF 1914\r\nProf. Chris Clark (St Catharine's)\r\nProfessor of Modern European History \r\nUntil recently, a bronze plaque in Sarajevo commemorated the moment in June 1914 when the young Bosnian Serb nationalist Gavrilo Princip assassinated an Austrian Archduke and took ‘the first steps into Yugoslav liberty’. National tensions wrought havoc on the Balkan peninsula in 1912 and 1913 and triggered the outbreak of the First World War. After the collapse of Soviet power, they helped to bring about the dissolution of the Yugoslavian state. Chris Clark unravels the legacies of a region in which political borders and cultural identities have never coincided.\r\n\r\nMAKING AND BREAKING MODERN SOUTH ASIA\r\nDr Joya Chatterji (Trinity)\r\nReader in Modern South Asian History\r\nThe British Raj came to an abrupt end in 1947 but millions of people in South Asia are still living with the legacies of its break-up. Joya Chatterji unravels the tangled story and the nationalist mythologies spun around it. A schools project she has developed in London with migrants from Bangladesh shows how a clearer understanding of the past can promote reconciliation in the present.\r\n\r\nBRITAIN, EUROPE AND THE LEGACIES OF 1940\r\nProf. David Reynolds (Christ's)\r\nProfessor of International History\r\nThe events of 1940 cast a long shadow over modern Europe.

The battle for editorial independence", "synopsis": "Is it possible to build a clear wall between the donor/sponsor and creative vision?", "keywords": "Quangocracy, Economy, Restrictions, Austerity", "body": "The maelstrom of economic austerity has shaken up every sector, from the arts to scientific research. While the coalition government ignites a ‘bonfire of quangos’ – with high-profile victims such as the UK Film Council – broadcasters tighten their belts, and commissioning of serious TV looks ever more precarious. In this desperate climate, what’s a documentary film-maker to do to secure funding? Taking the place of quangos are independent foundations and corporate marketing bodies, keen to trumpet new models of funding and distributing documentaries. From the UK’s BRITDOC to the Gucci Tribeca Fund and the Sundance Institute, the media landscape is changing dramatically. Filmmakers are advised that the best way to ensure ‘ambitious, issue-driver films get made’ is by turning to ‘charities, foundations, brands and companies with CSR agendas’. But is there a danger of losing sight of the purpose of documentary filmmaking in pursuit of funds?\r\n\r\nSome worry filmmakers will end up dancing to the tune of organisations with agendas of their own. NGOs and charities may well be delighted if offered films that reflect their core, partisan concerns. But does this put pressure of filmmakers to talk up their social purpose in order to attract funding and attention? It is argued that ‘third sector and documentary filmmakers have much in common’ because ‘they both want to create change around an issue they care passionately about’. But might this not mean using social purpose films to usurp politics and democracy? BRITDOC champions the newly fashionable idea that ‘Films are the best medium for changing hearts and minds and lives’ and that ‘Films inspire people to engage and act’. But is such hyperbolic politicking too much to ask of films? Should they not be free to document and observe and let audiences make their own minds up? Is complexity and nuance threatened by the propaganda needs of changing the world? \r\n\r\nMeanwhile corporates – defensive about their poor reputations and a popular hostility to big business in the wake of the financial crisis – may well be delighted to fund films to demonstrate their corporate social responsibility. But as capitalism seeks to justify its worthiness through finding a new social mission, and everyone from Puma Vision to McKinsey have become interested in worthy documentaries, should filmmakers be wary? Who protects editorial independence when documentaries are ‘sold’ to the myriad of new funding partners? Is it possible to build a clear wall between the donor/sponsor and creative vision? While it’s naïve to imagine a golden age when TV commissioning editors never interfered in programme content to improve ratings, arguably that commissioning process was more direct and transparent. To whom are the new foundations, content-commissioners by default, answerable? Might they be a new quangocracy, accountable to no-one? Can film-makers tap this new source of funds without compromising their integrity. What do the emerging funding models say about the role of documentary today?

In his new book, Michelangelo’s Finger, Raymond Tallis shows just how important this seemingly insignificant difference has been in determining humanity’s radically different evolutionary pathway.\r\n\r\nTallis examines how pointing the index finger has made such a significant contribution to hominid development and to the emergence of a human world set apart from nature. Starting with Michelangelo’s famous fresco on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, where the index fingers of God and Man are central to the representation of the Creation of Adam, Tallis explores the role the index finger plays in the development of our humanity. His inquiry examines the background to pointing, false claims that animals point, the significance of the failure of pointing in people with autism, the interaction between pointing and language, the relationship between pointing and power, and the ingenuity of artificial pointers. He concludes by showing how pointing casts a light on the way humans, unique among living creatures, transcend their organic condition, and lead their lives rather than merely living them. \r\n\r\nRAYMOND TALLIS was Professor of Geriatric Medicine at the University of Manchester until 2006. A poet, novelist and philosopher, he was listed by the Independent in 2007 as one of fifty ‘Brains of Britain’; in 2005 Prospect magazine named him as one of Britain’s top 100 Public Intellectuals.

But sincere and active practitioner that she was, she performed ritual, meditated, had mystical visions, and taught neophytes in the order. Some remember her as the more prudish of the Golden Dawn, but this is unfair, for she chain-smoked, never married, and sometimes appeared in public wearing exotic outfits. Another facet of Annie Horniman's life was her pioneering work in the theatre, driven by a belief that theatre brings spiritual richness to people generally, and to this end she was, through her life, active in funding and production in British theatre -- numerous projects that are still recognised today: West End shows, repertory theatre, and ritual theatre. She founded the Abbey Theatre in Dublin and the Gaeity Theatre in Manchester. Artists whose work she supported included WB Yeats and GB Shaw.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in the Golden Dawn, magical women, and the power of theatre, this night is for you.

The event is free and everyone’s welcome.\r\n\r\nQuestions to be considered will include: What changes are feasible in the UK, regarding attitudes towards transhumanism and progress with specific H+ projects, between now and 2012? What role can interested individuals play in regard to these projects? What could go wrong - and how can we guard against these drawbacks?\r\n\r\nThe panel of presenters include:\r\n\r\nAnders Sandberg, Neuroethics researcher at the Future of Humanity Institute, Oxford University;\r\nBen Zaiboc, UKTA, London;\r\nDavid Wood, UKTA, London.\r\n\r\nDiscussion is likely to continue after the event in a nearby pub, for those who are able to stay.

Note that Torrington Square is pedestrian-only.\r\n\r\nHere's how to reach the lecture room from the nearby Russell Square tube station (this may sound long but it will take less than 10 minutes):\r\n\r\nCome out of the tube station and turn left, to walk west along Bernard Street. Cross over first Herbrand St then Woburn Place and continue to walk roughly westwards, keeping to the north side of Russell Square.

", "body": "Much of the time the challenge in innovation is one of ‘doing what we do, but better’ – continuously improving products and services and enhancing our processes. The trouble is that from time to time there are discontinuous shifts in the environment – events which pull the carpet out from under our feet and rewrite the rules of the game. For example, a radical new technology appears which changes the underlying knowledge base on which the firm operates. Or a completely new market emerges at the fringe and becomes mainstream – in the process disrupting the cosy arrangements amongst established players who are suddenly wrong-footed. Or business models change – as we have seen with low-cost airlines, the music industry or across the Internet.\r\n\r\nHow do firms deal with this kind of innovation – how do they work at the edge of chaos where new threats and opportunities are only dimly visible? And how do they search for innovation triggers or pick up on weak signals about emerging – but possibly radically different - futures? This presentation will look at some of the emerging approaches, drawing on the experiences of an international network of companies involved in our research on discontinuous innovation. \r\n\r\nProfessor John Bessant, BSc., PhD. currently holds the Chair in Innovation and Technology Management at Tanaka Business School, Imperial College where he is also Research Director.

Tackling these challenges will require a common effort and common understanding. At Chinadialogue they aim to promote that common understanding. By establishing the world's first fully bilingual website devoted to the environment they aim to promote direct dialogue and the search for solutions to our shared environmental challenges.

Hilton, who holds a degree in Sinology from the University of Edinburgh and also studied at the Peking Language Institute and the Fudan University in Shanghai, discusses editorial approaches to drawing together two different language communities around a shared topic.

But there is more to what we eat and why, and all cooking has three vital ingredients that no pill-popping can possibly emulate: technique, art and perhaps most crucially, love. Join Hervé as he introduces us to the wonders and delights of ‘molecular gastronomy’, the culinary discipline developed by Hervé and the late Nicholas Kurti that has taken the world by storm. Did you know that all recipes comprise two parts – a definition and additions that cover the old wives’ tales, proverbs and tips that all cooks pick up along the way? Using experiments and demonstrations, Hervé and Michelin-starred chef Pierre Gagnaire will show how art can make direct use of science to create a wonderful marriage of science et cuisine. This lecture is in memoriam of Nicholas Kurtiand Michael Faraday, and a dish named after this ‘prince of experimentalists’ will be revealed on the night! Sir John Krebs, former Chair of the Food standards Agency, current Principal of Jesus College Oxford and this year’s Christmas Lecturer will chair this event.\r\n\r\nPierre Gagnaire is the proud possessor of three Michelin stars, and owner of the acclaimed restaurants Pierre Gagnaire (Paris) and Sketch (London; co-owned with Mourad Mazouz).

How are speech and language difficulties constructed around differences in language development in English and other languages? To what extent do speech and language difficulties result from material language learning needs in two languages? \r\n\r\nIt focuses on two categories of difficulty: difficulties in reading related to speech difficulties (dyslexia), and difficulties in fluent speech (dysfluency, also known as stammering and stuttering). I take them as examples to discuss how bilingual speakers may show these difficulties, and to interrogate the extent to which bilingualism may be thought to cause or exacerbate language difficulties. I will also look at what is meant by intervention. Is intervention successful only through individual-based clinical models which focus on language processing? Can we successfully support speech and language difficulties in inclusive education settings? Is intervention successful in one or both languages?\r\n\r\nThrough this discussion we may obtain more insight into how we theorise speech and language difficulties, and how working with bilingual speakers can advance understanding of both speech and language and difficulties and approaches to intervention.\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 60, "image_id": null, "added": "2004-05-17T12:56:44", "slug": "speech-and-language-difficulties-in-bilingual-children-flaky-social-construct-or-double-deficit", "speakers": [{"id": 620, "name": "Deirdre Martin", "slug": "deirdre-martin"}], "topics": [{"id": 88, "name": "linguistics", "path": "/academic/linguistics"}, {"id": 377, "name": "language", "path": "/academic/language"}], "supercategory": "academic", "venue": {"id": 200, "name": "Essex University, Linguistics Dept", "slug": "essex-university-linguistics-dept", "city": "Colchester", "postcode": "CO4 3SQ"}, "organizer": {"id": 200, "name": "Essex University, Linguistics Dept", "slug": "essex-university-linguistics-dept"}, "date": "2004-05-27", "dates": [{"id": 501, "from_date": "2004-05-27", "to_date": "2004-05-27", "time": "16:00:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": null, "additional_info": "Directions and map available at \"http://www.essex.ac.uk/about/find.html\":http://www.essex.ac.uk/about/find.html", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 200, "name": "Essex University, Linguistics Dept", "slug": "essex-university-linguistics-dept", "city": "Colchester", "postcode": "CO4 3SQ"}, "organizer": {"id": 200, "name": "Essex University, Linguistics Dept", "slug": "essex-university-linguistics-dept"}}]}, {"id": 547, "title": "Jill, Duchess of Hamilton", "synopsis": "William Morris's Red House and the Birth of Arts & Crafts", "keywords": "arts and crafts, interior design, architecture, applied arts", "body": null, "additional_info": null, "duration": null, "image_id": 94, "added": "2004-05-10T20:46:40", "slug": "d54c6449a29e6af5", "speakers": [{"id": 200, "name": "speaker TBC", "slug": "speaker-tbc"}], "topics": [{"id": 346, "name": "painting", "path": "/arts/finearts/painting"}, {"id": 357, "name": "preraphaelite", "path": "/academic/historyofart/english/preraphaelite"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 242, "name": "New York School of Interior Design", "slug": "new-york-school-of-interior-design", "city": "New York, NY", "postcode": "NY10 021"}, "organizer": {"id": 241, "name": "Royal Oak Foundation", "slug": "royal-oak-foundation"}, "date": "2004-04-28", "dates": [{"id": 561, "from_date": "2004-04-28", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "18:00:00", "ticket_cost": "USD20 non-members, USD30 members", "ticket_info": "Tickets are available online from the Royal Oak \"website\":https://www.royal-oak.org/ShopSite/lectures/AtAGlanceFrame.htm", "additional_info": "Indicated times reflect the start of the lectures themselves or the departure times for our day tours.
