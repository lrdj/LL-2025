Room V105, Vine building, Middlesex University, London, NW4 4BT\r\n\r\nDebates about digital reading are beset by stereotypes such as those of the ‘digital native’, and crude binaries about print vs screen cultures.  Two projects supported by the AHRC – Researching Readers Online (2012) and The Digital Reading Network (2013-14) – set out to provide more nuanced insights into the practices of digital readers and to explore new approaches to the study of readers based on the rich data about reading available to us thanks to the digital revolution.  A third project, Reading on Screen (2017-18), employed innovative participatory methods to create over 30 digital stories reflecting the complex and often contradictory experiences of contemporary readers from a variety of social backgrounds and ages.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, I will reflect on the efficacy of the digital storytelling method for eliciting reader responses of a radically different kind to those we are accustomed to from academic studies reliant on interviews, questionnaires or textual analysis.  I will also outline the main outcomes and impact of the project, both planned and unplanned, particularly focusing on group dynamics, benefits reported by participants, and follow on activities and creative projects initiated by them.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIO\r\n\r\nBronwen Thomas is Professor of English and New Media at Bournemouth University and Director of the Centre for the Study of Journalism, Culture and Community.

Even the normally bare-footed Socrates has put on a pair of shoes in recognition that this is high company – but into this circle of Athens' intelligentsia Socrates introduces the initiating priestess Diotima.  He recalls how she taught him the hidden mysteries of Love or Eros – a strange intermediary between mortals and the immortal Gods, an unconquerable power who calls each of us towards divine beauty, a conductor of souls to their happiest life.  Step by step, Socrates says, she showed him the path to the highest goal of human striving, following the pattern laid out by the mystery initiations of Eleusis.  She also shows how profoundly Eros and Philosophy are related to each other: for in just the same way that Eros is an intermediary, so too is Philosophy (the love of wisdom), standing as she does between our ordinary consciousness and true Wisdom.  In this workshop we will explore the teaching of Diotima as reported by Socrates, attempting to follow that path of initiation in which truth and beauty are conjoined, for as the Platonically inclined Keats wrote –\r\n\r\n\"Beauty is truth, truth beauty,\" – that is all\r\nYe know on earth, and all ye need to know.\r\n\r\nNo previous experience of formal philosophy is required. \r\n\r\nThere is a fee of £25 to cover expenses - if you can't afford this do contact us and request a reduced fee. \r\n\r\nPlaces are limited (15 maximum), so book as early as you can.

His most recent production End of Dreams is an ode to the countless lives that have been lost by those attempting to traverse the Mediterranean Sea in order to reach Europe.

Larsen has exhibited extensively around the world.\r\n\r\nDr David Farrier is a senior lecturer in modern and contemporary literature at the University of Edinburgh. He has published studies of nineteenth century Pacific travel writing (Unsettled Narratives, 2007) and refugees in contemporary literature and film (Postcolonial Asylum, 2011), and is currently writing a book about deep time in contemporary poetry. Dr Farrier convenes the Edinburgh Environmental Humanities Network.\r\n\r\nDr Lindsay Bremner is an architect and scholar originally based in Johannesburg, South Africa, where she published, lectured and exhibited widely on the transformation of the city after apartheid. She taught architecture at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, at Temple University in Philadelphia, and at MIT as a visiting professor before taking up her current post as Director of Architectural Research at the University of Westminster. Her work seeks to position architectural research in wider material and socio-political fields.

Globally, the richest 1% have never held a greater share of world wealth, while the share of most of the other 99% has fallen in the last five years, with more and more people in debt, especially the young. Economic inequalities will persist and continue to grow for as long as we tolerate the injustices which underpin them. \r\n\r\nThis fully rewritten and updated edition revisits Dorling’s claim that Beveridge’s five social evils are being replaced by five new tenets of injustice: elitism is efficient; exclusion is necessary; prejudice is natural; greed is good and despair is inevitable. \r\n\r\nBy showing these beliefs are unfounded, Dorling offers hope of a more equal society. We are living in the most remarkable and dangerous times.

For some, that was the day the ruling MPLA party turned on dissidents and launched a drawn-out massacre, with the help of the Cuban army, that would claim thousands of lives; for others, it was the day a band of far left, anti-mestiço and anti-white racists violently tried to conduct a coup against Agostinho Neto’s government. Lara Pawson lived and worked in Angola as the BBC correspondent from 1998-2000, when she learned about the uprising and its consequences. \r\n\r\nThis book follows her investigation to dig up the truth of what really happened on the 27 May, to try to understand why certain British Marxists helped cover up the killings, and how the events of 1977 continue to influence politics in Angola to this day. \r\n\r\n‘In the Name of the People: Angola’s Forgotten Massacre’ has been shortlisted for the Political Book Awards Debut Political Book of the Year 2015, was runner-up in the Royal Africa Society book of the year 2014, was shortlisted for the Bread and Roses Award for Radical Publishing 2015 and has been shortlisted for the Orwell Prize 2015.\r\n\r\n‘With unflagging intelligence, fearlessness, and compassion, Pawson unfolds the human and political dimensions of this forgotten atrocity. She has done Angola a great service in writing this book, and all of us, Angolan or otherwise, do ourselves a great service in reading it.’ Teju Cole, author of Open City\r\n\r\n‘Pawson brings her sources to life like a novelist; her meetings are vivid and convincing. A simple, direct clarity of vision is brought to bear, and the reader begins to make some sense of the conspiracies and sub-conspiracies that led to the vinte-sete. By the end, Angola – along with some of its layered political complexity – is raw, vital, brutal and alive in front of us.’ M.

Hot on the heels of the ancient painters whose scenes glow like eye-witness testimony, we find Botticelli, Caravaggio, Claude Lorrain, David, De Chirico, Flaxman, Fuseli, Giulio Romano, Il Padovanino, Il Pinturicchio, Ingres, Angelica Kauffman, Leighton, Moreau, Rubens, Tiepolo, Tischbein and others queueing up to catch our breath.

Has society learnt anything from this and, in particular, does anarchism have a role to play? \r\n\r\nThe ideal of anarchism is the abolition of all government and the organisation of society on a voluntary, cooperative basis without recourse to force or compulsion. Indeed, this is the ideal of socialism in general. Authoritarian and anarchistic socialism are associated with the names of Marx and Bakunin.\r\n\r\nThe Marxist programme is for the State to be taken over by a group of people appointed by the working class, who will then guide people to learn to become so co-operative, that the State is no longer needed! Anarchism on the other hand, seeks to undermine the authoritarian institutions, not by direct assault but by attrition, so that people cease to trust them, and they lose power little by little. This talk will argue that the anarchist approach is the more efficient and could have relevance in our society today.\r\n\r\nDonald Rooum says that he first became interested in anarchism in 1944 when he visited Speaker's Corner in London while on a Ministry of Food scheme which used schoolboys to pick hops in Kent. He subscribed to War Commentary, thus beginning a connection with Freedom Press which has continued for over sixty years. During that time he has been a writer for and an editor of Freedom, the name to which War Commentary reverted after the end of the Second World War.\r\nIn 1949, Rooum began to raise his profile in activist circles, participating in the annual anarchist summer school. The working title of Frank Lisle's 1952 portrait was The Anarchist. Rooum became an outdoor speaker Market Street, Bradford, then at Speaker's Corner.

It is not (as is often thought) a morality of rigid rules. Nor is it vague. He explicates the ideas of happiness and perfection in a way that fits well with our intuitions.

Join British astronaut, Dr Helen Sharman, and former Soviet cosmonaut, Anatoly Artsebarsky, as they talk about their rigorous 18 month training at Star City, their joint flight to the Mir Space Station in 1991, the research science they carried out on board and what it is like to live in zero gravity, and how it feels to walk outside the space station.\r\n\r\nBritish Astronaut, Helen Sharman OBE was the first Briton in orbit. On 18 May 1991, Helen flew to the Mir Space Station on board Soyuz-TM12, aged 27. Before flying, Helen spent 18 months in intensive flight training in Star City on the outskirts of Moscow. The Soyuz TM-12 mission, which included Soviet cosmonauts Anatoly Artsebarsky and Sergei Krikalev, lasted eight days, most of that time spent at the Mir space station. Helen's tasks included medical and agricultural scientific experiments, photographing the British Isles, and participating in an amateur radio hookup with British schoolchildren.  Since her return, Helen has become one of the UK's leading ambassadors for science. She was awarded the OBE in 1992 and is a fellow of the Royal Society of Chemistry, the Royal Geographical Society, the Royal Aeronautical Society and the British Interplanetary Society. Helen has won numerous awards including the Medal “For Merit in Space Exploration\" in 2012 from the Russian Federation government. Helen is currently Group Leader of Surface and Nanoanalysis at the National Physical Laboratory.\r\n\r\nFormer Soviet Cosmonaut, Anatoly Pavlovich Artsebarsky flew aboard Soyuz TM-12 in 1991 with Helen Sharman and docked with the Mir Space Station where he spent almost 5 months in space with fellow Russian Cosmonaut Sergei Krikalev while the rest of the crew including Helen flew back to Earth after eight days. Anatoly took six spacewalks during his Mir EO-9 mission and spent over 33 hours walking in space. Anatoly and Sergei Krikalev (the cosmonaut who has the world record for the longest time spent in space) were almost stuck at the station as they were in orbit during the Soviet coup attempt of 1991. Anatoly was made a Hero of the Soviet Union and Pilot-Cosmonaut of the USSR and was awarded the Order of Lenin and the Medal For Merit in Space Exploration. \r\n\r\nThis special event has been jointly organised by the Science & Innovation Network (SIN)-Russia and the Royal Society.

But can we really muzzle tabloid newshounds at the same time as protecting the techniques of investigative journalism that speaks truth to power? While those who sought to limit the influence of Rupert Murdoch and expose illegal red top practices might see the closing of the News of the World as a victory for responsible reporting, further revelations of police complicity and widespread use of private investigators to steal information threaten all of Fleet Street. Has understandable disgust at the treatment of the Dowler family been used to justify a crackdown on journalism by the very people it is supposed to investigate?\r\n\r\nIn the name of the public, politicians and judges are considering the biggest reorganisation of journalism in the modern era, but do ordinary people really want this? The public did not complain about hacking when stolen information revealed the MPs’ expenses racket or the ‘Climategate’ scandal, or when WikiLeaks exposed war crimes. Do Hugh Grant, Paul McCartney and Max Mosley really represent the people?\r\n\r\nHowever politicians may exploit the scandal, many people do not trust a press that is obsessed with celebrity; even the broadsheets, the supposedly quality newspapers, seem to follow a similar news agenda to the red tops, picking up the tabloid droppings and processing them into more acceptable forms.

Hobsbawm regarded the enlightenment as a conspiracy of white men in wigs providing the intellectual foundation for imperialism. But more recent historians have developed an important understanding of how the enlightenment functioned in the UK: recently Roy Porter has transformed our apprehension of the eighteenth century and J.G. A. Pocock a little earlier developed a clear view of the considerable intellectual ideas of the period. This lecture will argue that cultural, political and religious developments in 18th century Britain have left a lasting legacy on the intellectual foundations of today’s humanism.\r\n\r\nHume had one of the finest minds of the era – or any era – and was especially impressive in writing about miracles or atheism. Gibbon changed thinking completely in writing a secular account of early Christianity in his Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. There were the profound thinkers and the activists. Wilkes in his struggle for free speech and struggle with Parliament and Paine in his emphasis on the rights of man and the need to write critically about the Bible had followers who led to conflict and long term development of an understanding of human rights. Methodism was the most dynamic strand of religion with an emphasis on good works – one of which was for some the abolition of the sale of slaves. Conway, who became the leader of SPES in the nineteenth century trained as a Methodist and became an itinerant Methodist preacher and vigorous campaigner against the slave system.\r\n\r\nIndividual thinkers have their impact, but the underlying changes in society were also important. Eighteenth century Britain was a place with much poverty and hardship, but there was growing wealth and leisure, a burgeoning press for newspapers and books, a really important spread of scientific ideas and activities. By the end of the century the undercurrents and individual intellects had transformed society. Wollstonecraft and Godwin were able to provide a completely new way of looking at the world.  The eighteenth century enlightenment was a key stage on the road to twenty-first century humanism.\r\n", "keywords": "History, Politics, Philosophy, Secularism", "body": "Jim Herrick is a historian, author and former editor of both New Humanist  and The Freethinker.

Landscape, therefore, becomes a substrate and a surface with potential to record and be recorded: a space where forms of ‘writing-out’ and ‘writing-on’ can occur. The research takes a number of forms and combines a variety of media: text, sound, still and moving image.\r\nVenue: Baines Wing Miall Lecture Theatre 2.34, University of Leeds\r\nCampus map of buildings: click on this link, then launch the interactive campus map, and choose Baines Wing from the list on the right.\r\nhttp://www.leeds.ac.uk/timetable/assets/map/index.htm\r\nFrom the main entrance, go straight on past the front desk, then through the doors on the left.

Called “The Guru and the Pandit,” this ongoing series has been the most enduring and popular feature of EnlightenNext magazine—and has profoundly affected the lives of tens of thousands of readers around the world.\r\n\r\nNow these two defining voices in the field of spiritual and cultural transformation will bring their unique combination of spiritual experience and theoretical wisdom to an exclusive, first-of-its-kind, live event: a four-hour virtual seminar that comprehensively examines what it means to live an integral, evolutionary life. In this unique forum, Cohen and Wilber will explore how each of us can become a fully awake, purposeful, and integral human being who, through our own example, demonstrates that a more enlightened future truly is possible, especially in these difficult and uncertain times.\r\n\r\nImagine being present while  two of the world’s leading spiritual visionaries discuss how to live an awakened life that makes sense in our contemporary world. After four hours, you’d walk away with a clear sense of how to evolve and an understanding of how to internalize and express their groundbreaking insights. And you’d discover a renewed sense of confidence that even in these challenging times, you can become an example of a new way forward for humanity.  \r\n\r\nOn Saturday, May 9,from 5pm to 10.00pm GMT, you’ll be able to experience just that, as internationally renowned teachers Ken Wilber and Andrew Cohen host their third-ever interactive event for the public. \r\nHow the event will be structured\r\nDuring the first two-hour session (5.00pm to 7:00pm GMT), Andrew Cohen and Ken Wilber will present and explore the most common obstacles faced by those of us following an authentic path of transformation. As they look at how we can facilitate spiritual and cultural evolution through the lenses of Evolutionary Enlightenment and integral theory, you will gain a deep understanding of how to interpret, and even transcend, those important challenges—and discover a profound spiritual strength that will help you persevere through them. \r\n\r\nAfter a one-hour break, the second two-hour session (8:00pm to 10:00pm GMT) will be devoted entirely to responding to the questions and comments you email to us during the break. Andrew Cohen and Ken Wilber will use your thoughts and insights to further explore the elements and ideas that emerged during the first session.\r\n\r\nWhat you’ll receive as a participant\r\nIn addition to the opportunity to participate in this rare and historic event, you’ll also receive the MP3 downloads of all four hours of the seminar. So if you can’t make it at the scheduled time, you’ll be able to experience the seminar in its entirety afterward—and you’ll be able to revisit it over and over again. We will also be selecting the best comments or questions that you send in during the break for publication on a blog that will be open to all participants to read after the event.\r\n\r\nYour tuition The chance to engage with these two luminaries for such an extended period of time is so rare and valuable that we could easily command a high price for attendance. But in order to enable as many people as possible to participate, we’ve made tuition only $97. That includes all four hours of the seminar, in addition to the MP3 downloads. For this very reasonable fee you’ll be able to spend an entire afternoon deepening your understanding of the meaning of spiritual development today with two of the greatest thinkers of our time—not to mention the opportunity to have your questions answered personally by them.

Even before the war began it was realised that London would be a target and subject to unprecedented demands on health services. In order to deal with the expected casualties from air raids, the Emergency Medical Service was formed and the city divided into sectors for the evacuation and treatment of the injured. This involved a completely new co-operation and collaboration between the great independent charity hospitals of London and the municipal hospitals - and became a precursor of the Postwar National Health Service. At the same time as there was greater co-ordination of hospital services for air raid casualties and wounded servicemen, health services for the average Londoner came under ever greater pressure. The London County Council School Medical Service and midwifery services were greatly reduced on the assumption that all children and expectant mothers would have all been evacuated, despite many of them returning to their homes as soon as, and whenever, possible. Doctors were called up, hospitals bombed, sanitary conditions in the public air raid shelters horrendous and medicines in short supply. Yet it was patriotic to be fighting fit and Londoners were urged to stay as healthy as possible to help win the war. Against the odds, London came through.

This has been his business since 1994 and prior to that he designed and wrote software for 25 years.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Gordon became a member of Pro-Imaging, a web based international support & campaigning organisation for professional photographers, and in 2007, became a member of the Pro-Imaging management team. In 2007, Gordon proposed mounting a campaign against rights grabbing competitions. Since then he has helped Pro-Imaging construct a foundation for the campaign, the Bill of Rights, which was implemented in March 2008. He is also involved in the day-to-day operation and liaison with contest organisers and the media.\r\n\r\nChris Coe\r\nSince turning professional in 1992, Chris has photographed landscapes, people, architecture, gardens, travel destinations and wildlife around the world. Most of his work is commissioned, for specific advertising and editorial projects, or for stock libraries. He has shot over 40 travel and coffee table books and undertakes commissions for a wide range of major multinational companies. His images have been widely published in newspapers, magazines and books, and his book ‘The Art of Landscape Photography' is a widely-used reference work. Chris is current working on a book called 'Creative DSLR Photography'.\r\n\r\nIn 2003, Chris founded the now prestigious international Travel Photographer of the Year awards. As a working professional it was Chris's objective to create awards, which provided a showcase for the best contemporary photography whilst respecting the photographers' copyright. He has taken a stand on copyright abuse and the more recently unrestricted licenses which make so many photographic competitions little more than a rights grab.\r\n\r\nWith his perspective on photographic competitions from both sides of the fence he is able to bring together the rights grab issue from both perspectives. http://www.chriscoe.com\r\n\r\nThe panel is chaired by\r\n\r\nNick Dunmur \r\nis a commercial and advertising photographer based in Nottingham for the twenty years he has been in business since attending Trent Polytechnic and completing the degree course there.
