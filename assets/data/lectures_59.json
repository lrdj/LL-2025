Educated at Cambridge and King’s College London, he is the author of seven books, including Borderlands, an overview of strange phenomena reviewed by New Scientist as “exhaustive, erudite and superb.” He now runs a company devoted to improving critical thinking in schools and universities. \r\n\r\nAndrea Kitta – Slender Man\r\n\r\nThe Slender Man is a contemporary monster that has stepped out from the digital world and out in to the physical. Dr Andrea Kitta discusses the beginnings of Slenderman on the Something Awful forum and other venues for creepypasta, there is a shared aesthetic and, at times, a shared experience that taps into something deeper than mere play. Just as Slender Man himself is complicated, so is belief in Slender Man.\r\n\r\nSlender Man is not a simple entity that can be looked at as belonging to a single folk group. He is, possibly, an acknowledgement of the unacknowledged common experience of being watched. The reason why he “feels real” to so many people is because he helps to give a voice to a real experience that is difficult to understand otherwise. Like legends, which are not literally true but rather “typify life in modern society” (Smith 1999), Slender Man also is a part of the experience of life in the modern world.\r\n\r\nAndrea Kitta is a folklorist with a specialty in medicine, belief, and the supernatural. She is also interested in Internet folklore, narrative, and contemporary (urban) legend. Her current research includes: vaccines, pandemic illness, contagion and contamination, stigmatized diseases, disability, health information on the Internet and Slender Man. She is co-editor for the journal Contemporary Legend, a scholarly journal published annually by the International Society for Contemporary Legend Research.\r\n\r\nAntony Clayton – Subterranean London\r\n\r\nAntony Clayton, author of Subterranean City, Beneath the Streets of London and Secret Tunnels of England: Folklore & Fact, will examine aspects of the folklore of underground London. The talk will concentrate principally on some of the stories of the capital’s ancient ‘secret’ passages and tunnels and sightings of ghosts underground.\r\n\r\nDr David Clarke – Tears for Fears: The Curse of the Crying Boy\r\n\r\nThe Crying Boy (TCB) is a mass produced sentimental print and an example of ‘folk art’ that was popular from the 1970s in working glass families in the UK. It exists in many forms. In 1985 a British tabloid newspaper The Sun published a series of hyperbolic stories reporting the existence of a jinx attached to this hideously tasteless, yet popular print. The source of the stories was attributed fire fighters who had noted the frequent occurrence of the print at domestic property fires in one English community. The intervention of journalists added a supernatural element to the story and created a proto-legend. This talk examines how TCB acquired a narrative and was transformed as it migrated from print to online media.\r\n\r\nDavid Clarke teaches Media Law, regulation and ethics on the undergraduate and postgraduate journalism courses at Sheffield Hallam. As Principal Research Fellow he leads on integrating teaching and research in the Journalism Subject Group.\r\n\r\nHis publications and wide experience as a broadcaster and consultant/curator for The National Archives UFO project has brought international recognition to the University as a centre of expertise in the study of contemporary legends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPulp Fiction to Pop-Nihilism: H.P. Lovecraft’s Cthulhu and the Making of a Modern Monstrous Myth.\r\n\r\nMonsters continue to haunt the landscape and imagination of ‘rational’ metropolitan modernity, often in new and unexpected forms which reflect uniquely modern fears and anxieties. Cthulhu – the monstrously betentacled denizen of the deep and H.P. Lovecraft’s best-known literary creation – is one such entity: despite their well-documented origin in the weird fiction of the 1920s, both Cthulhu and Lovecraft’s expanded ‘Cthulhu mythos’ are considered to be an authentic esoteric reality by some – a supposition which has exerted a significant influence upon some of the conspiratorial, cryptozoological, and paranormal beliefs which populate contemporary digital and media worlds. \r\n\r\nThis talk explores the evolution of Cthulhu from Lovecraft’s own secular expression of modern existential dread, through to its current status as nihilistic occultural and pop-cultural myth, examining its resonance in relation to the angst, unease and alienation often seen to characterise existence in a rapidly-changing and increasingly uncertain world.\r\n\r\nJustin Woodman is a lecturer in anthropology at Goldsmiths College (The University of London), where he teaches courses on the anthropology of the paranormal, and has written on the intersection between Lovecraft’s fiction and contemporary occultures.\r\nGail-Nina Anderson - The Vampire Rabbit of Newcastle upon Tyne\r\n\r\nAmongst its fair share of public statuary and sculpted architectural detail, Newcastle counts a unique representation – the Vampire Rabbit. In a quiet corner behind the Cathedral, above the door of a 1901 office building it squats menacingly, complete with lurid claws and fangs. This talk explores the tall tales that have sprung up around our beloved (and still inexplicable) beast and their relation to folklore traditions involving rabbits and hares.\r\n\r\n\r\nTina Rath – The Hackney Bear Hunt \r\n“We were near the football pitches at about five o’clock in the evening when we\r\n\r\nsaw it,” said Darren Willoughby, aged 12, “It was very close to us, standing on its hind legs and about seven feet tall.”\r\n\r\nOn 27 December1981 four boys from Lower Clapton took their dogs out for a walk across Hackney Marshes. Past Millfields Road, near the football pitches, the boys encountered “a giant great growling hairy thing”. They met a bear in Hackney.\r\n\r\nTina Rath hunts the story of the Hackney Bear, the police hunt for it and how is returned in 2012 and why a Brit Pop bands may have been involved. Tina gained her doctorate from London University with a thesis on The Vampire in Popular Fiction and her MA with a dissertation on The Vampire in the Theatre.\r\n\r\n\r\nScott Wood – The Legend of the Hidden Insult\r\nDid you hear about the insult hidden in the jacket of a prince or inside the car of a queen?

Dr. Jennifer Rodgers will discuss how an organization established to ameliorate the crimes of Nazism reframed international humanitarian norms as well as the practice of relief itself.

We'll read a selection of extracts from the dialogue, and then discuss some of its implications. \r\n\r\nNo previous experience of formal philosophy is required.\r\n\r\nEntrance is free, but donations between £3-5 will be welcomed.\r\n\r\nA PDF download of the extract we will be reading is available on our website together with further details of this and other Prometheus Trust's activities: www.prometheustrust.co.uk (the PDF is on the \"London Monday Evenings\" page.)\r\n\r\n\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 2694, "added": "2017-12-24T03:00:21", "slug": "platos-vision-one-reality-two-worlds-three-natures", "speakers": [{"id": 3573, "name": "  Tim Addey", "slug": "tim-addey"}], "topics": [{"id": 3272, "name": "life", "path": "/arts/literature/writing/life"}, {"id": 1822, "name": "philosophy", "path": "/academic/religion/religion/philosophy"}, {"id": 2388, "name": "philosophy", "path": "/arts/literature/philosophy/philosophy"}, {"id": 365, "name": "platonism", "path": "/arts/philosophy/platonism"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 3106, "name": "Cecil Sharp House", "slug": "cecil-sharp-house", "city": "London", "postcode": "NW1 7AY"}, "organizer": {"id": 2041, "name": "The Prometheus Trust", "slug": "the-prometheus-trust"}, "date": "2018-01-29", "dates": [{"id": 16579, "from_date": "2018-01-29", "to_date": "2018-01-29", "time": "20:00:00", "ticket_cost": "Donation", "ticket_info": null, "additional_info": null, "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 3106, "name": "Cecil Sharp House", "slug": "cecil-sharp-house", "city": "London", "postcode": "NW1 7AY"}, "organizer": {"id": 2041, "name": "The Prometheus Trust", "slug": "the-prometheus-trust"}}]}, {"id": 15927, "title": "Roddy Doyle", "synopsis": "One of Ireland’s best-loved writers makes his first appearance at the Irish Literary Society.

Smile has all the features for which Doyle has become famous: the razor-sharp dialogue, the humour, the superb evocation of childhood – but this is a novel unlike any he has written before. Just moved in to a new apartment, alone for the first time in years, Victor Forde goes every evening to Donnelly’s pub for a pint, a slow one. One evening his drink is interrupted. A man in shorts and pink shirt brings over his pint and sits down. He seems to know Victor’s name and to remember him from school. Says his name is Fitzpatrick. Victor dislikes him on sight, dislikes too the memories that Fitzpatrick stirs up of five years being taught by the Christian Brothers. He prompts other memories too – of Rachel, his beautiful wife who became a celebrity, and of Victor’s own small claim to fame, as the man who says the unsayable on the radio. But it’s the memories of school, and of one particular Brother, that he cannot control and which eventually threaten to destroy his sanity.", "additional_info": null, "duration": 60, "image_id": null, "added": "2017-09-07T17:39:33", "slug": "b5395537704945a2", "speakers": [{"id": 16620, "name": "Roddy Doyle", "slug": "roddy-doyle"}], "topics": [{"id": 4249, "name": "irish", "path": "/arts/books/talk/irish"}, {"id": 743, "name": "education", "path": "/academic/arts/linguistics/education"}, {"id": 3984, "name": "education", "path": "/politics/socialrecession/poverty/education"}, {"id": 4188, "name": "education", "path": "/leisure/familyhistory/recordsanddata/education"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 3143, "name": "Irish Literary Society", "slug": "irish-literary-society", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC1B 3NN"}, "organizer": {"id": 3143, "name": "Irish Literary Society", "slug": "irish-literary-society"}, "date": "2018-01-29", "dates": [{"id": 16481, "from_date": "2018-01-29", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "19:30:00", "ticket_cost": "10", "ticket_info": "http://irishlitsoc.org/event/roddy-doyle-29-jan/", "additional_info": null, "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 3143, "name": "Irish Literary Society", "slug": "irish-literary-society", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC1B 3NN"}, "organizer": {"id": 3143, "name": "Irish Literary Society", "slug": "irish-literary-society"}}]}, {"id": 15812, "title": "Abstinence and Justice: Food in the Christian Tradition", "synopsis": "Please join us for a Christian Social and Political Thought lecture by Dr David Grumett", "keywords": "food, justice, Christianity", "body": "Food is a growing issue in the public mind and Christian theology has more to say about it than may be realized.

But what exactly do we mean by gender? How can we best understand gender differences? How are current gender relations changing? What new paths are 'femininity' and 'masculinity' taking? What would it be like to live in a society in which differences of gender were transcended?\r\n\r\nIn this new edition of her popular and highly lauded book, Harriet Bradley provides an introduction to the concept of gender and the different theoretical approaches which have developed within gender studies. Utilizing life narratives, she investigates processes of gendering in three important spheres of contemporary social life: production, reproduction and consumption. \r\n\r\nThe book highlights the centrality of gender in everyday life and shows how thinking about gender is influenced by changing political contexts. As well as updating the discussion with the latest scholarship, political concerns and economic data, the new edition pays closer attention to intersectionality and hybrid identities, as well as exploring the complexities of contemporary relations of masculinity and femininity in the light of new feminist activities.\r\nThis lively and accessible book will be of interest to students across the social sciences, as well as anyone interested in contemporary relations between women and men.\r\n\r\nWinner of Choice's outstanding academic title award:\r\n\r\n“Bradley provides us with a fresh and very lucid account by drawing upon her own personal experiences, examining gender through the lenses of production, reproduction and consumption.”-Equality, Diversity and Inclusion\r\n\r\n“Bradley's clear and straightforward writing style, the inclusion of personal experiences and research findings allows the reader to reflect on the issues and ideas raised within this text without becoming entangled in complicated explanations of key concepts around gender ...

It will be argued that despite its obvious anchoring in verbal communication, request-making has more in common with non-verbal communication and therefore it should be interpreted as consisting of indexical signs: symptom, signal and model. A model for communication-based problem-solving, called the Pragmatic Wheel, is created on the basis of the imperative which is used to solve problems without negotiation to save society’s face. From this basic model a declarative variant is derived for negotiation between the speaker and the hearer – here the speaker’s face is prioritized, because s/he is taken deeply seriously. And, finally, from this model an interrogative variant is derived. This variant seems to avoid the notion of problem and to prioritize the hearer’s face.

Three so-called communicative supertypes are distinguished: Reality-oriented languages (Chinese and Russian); speaker-oriented languages (Japanese and Spanish); and hearer-oriented languages (English and Danish).

Today, the Holocaust has become the European paradigm of memorial sites and the universal icon of evil. Most recently some have claimed the Holocaust an international paradigm of human rights. These developments have evolved in different directions, creating greater understanding of the impact of the Holocaust on the one hand, and on the other making poor analogies and producing competing narratives of martyrdom. In Europe, in spite of the establishment of the International Day of Holocaust Remembrance (27 January), the memory of the Holocaust does not cease to cause tensions between the West and the postcommunist countries. This presentation discusses the major stages of the process of restoration of memory of the Holocaust in postcommunist Europe. By studying these dimensions carefully, we can learn about the reconceptualization of Jews and the Holocaust, and the limits of the recognition and integration of the “dark past” by broader multigenerational sections of postcommunist societies.\r\n\r\nJoanna Beata Michlic is a social and cultural historian, and founder and Director of HBI (Hadassah-Brandeis Institute) Project on Families, Children, and the Holocaust at Brandeis University", "additional_info": null, "duration": 60, "image_id": null, "added": "2013-12-22T15:28:50", "slug": "d8767d70ff0f9cb5", "speakers": [{"id": 14395, "name": "Dr Joanna Beata Michlic", "slug": "dr-joanna-beata-michlic"}], "topics": [{"id": 2692, "name": "history", "path": "/arts/finearts/film/film/history"}, {"id": 106, "name": "wwi", "path": "/arts/books/history/military/wwi"}, {"id": 107, "name": "wwii", "path": "/arts/books/history/military/wwii"}, {"id": 108, "name": "army", "path": "/arts/books/history/military/army"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 1886, "name": "The Wiener Library for the Study of the Holocaust and Genocide", "slug": "the-wiener-library-for-the-study-of-the-holocaust-and-genocide", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC1B 5DP"}, "organizer": {"id": 1886, "name": "The Wiener Library for the Study of the Holocaust and Genocide", "slug": "the-wiener-library-for-the-study-of-the-holocaust-and-genocide"}, "date": "2014-01-10", "dates": [{"id": 13848, "from_date": "2014-01-10", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "13:00:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": "Admission is free.

As part of this process, we have identified specific abnormalities in cancer cells that make them very different from normal cells. Importantly, some of these changes (or mutations) in cancer cells make them resistant to the standard treatments, such as radiation and chemotherapy, that have been used for many years. However, because cancer cells come to rely on these mutations to allow them to survive, grow and spread, they represent a potential weak spot in a tumour’s defences. Therefore, by developing new drugs that attack cancer cells through their Achilles’ heel, we may be able to improve the effects of radiotherapy in treating a range of tumour types. In this lecture, I will discuss a number of examples that are already allowing us to achieve better treatment results and will introduce others that hold enormous promise for the future.”   \r\n\r\nDr Kevin Harrington, The Institute of Cancer Research \r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 60, "image_id": 1713, "added": "2012-05-29T14:30:48", "slug": "radiation-smart-drugs-homing-in-on-cancers-achilles-heel", "speakers": [{"id": 12434, "name": "Dr  Kevin Harrington", "slug": "dr-kevin-harrington"}], "topics": [{"id": 3007, "name": "cancer", "path": "/academic/medicine/cancer"}, {"id": 299, "name": "health", "path": "/academic/health"}, {"id": 1556, "name": "education", "path": "/academic/education"}, {"id": 329, "name": "cancer", "path": "/science/medicine/cancer"}, {"id": 2274, "name": "academic", "path": "/academic/academic"}, {"id": 3008, "name": "radiotherapy", "path": "/academic/medicine/cancer/radiotherapy"}], "supercategory": "academic", "venue": {"id": 1440, "name": "The Wellcome Collection", "slug": "the-wellcome-collection", "city": "London", "postcode": "NW1 2BE"}, "organizer": {"id": 2674, "name": "The Royal College of Radilogists", "slug": "the-royal-college-of-radilogists"}, "date": "2012-06-18", "dates": [{"id": 11604, "from_date": "2012-06-18", "to_date": "2012-06-18", "time": "18:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": "Please email rcrlecture@rcr.ac.uk to register for your free place.", "additional_info": "If you would like to join us for this lecture please RSVP to rcrlecture@rcr.ac.uk.

In particular, the use of botany and palynology (the study of pollen, plant and fungal spores, and other microscopic remains) have been particularly useful in (a) linking people, objects, and places, (b) search and location of hidden remains, and (c) estimating times of body deposition and death.  She has used these disciplines in more than 200 criminal cases. \r\n\r\nAlmost any place has a unique biological profile, traces of which can be picked up by anything that comes directly into contact with it.  These traces are proxy indicators of that place and, if they are identified and quantified accurately, the experienced forensic ecologist/palynologist can envisage the place in question.\r\n\r\nWhen estimating the time that a body (or other object) has lain in situ on the surface of the ground, the changes in local flora and fauna, particularly below the body, can provide useful temporal information.  From such changes, it is also possible to track the routes taken by offenders to and from the deposition sites.  The identification of such offender pathways is of critical importance to investigators since they are able to minimise their search efforts.  Fungal growths on cadavers are also being used to estimate time since death.\r\n\r\nPalynomorphs (pollen, plant and fungal spores) can be picked up from any palyniferous surface by any object, and they can remain for long periods of time.  In vehicles, and on clothing and footwear, there will be multiple depositions of palynomorphs over time; there will also be a loss of palynomorphs over time.  Thus, the palynological profile on any object can be mixed.  However, with careful evaluation of all sites pertinent to a case, a skilled palynologist can determine the palynomorph assemblages that reflect the crime scene.  It is necessary to carry out detailed vegetation surveys of all relevant places and obtain comparator samples of soils and vegetation from them.  After comparison of the various palynological profiles from places and objects, locations may be implicated or eliminated.\r\n\r\nCase histories showing the power of the technique in linking people and objects with places, and in the location of deposition or burial sites of victims, are presented.  The limits to the use of palynological information in forensic cases are the abundance and variety of palynomorphs present, the high level of scientific experience necessary to distinguish and identify rare or unusual pollen and spores, and the familiarity of the forensic palynologist with plant communities and plant distributions.  Consequently, a scientist wishing to use these techniques to their fullest potential must have a strong background in plant ecology and palynology, and have good identification skills.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPatricia Wiltshire is an ecologist, botanist, and palynologist.  She started her research and teaching career at King’s College London.  She later worked in environmental reconstruction in archaeology at University College London.  Her experience of the difficulty of archaeological palynology meant that she was pre-adapted to work in the forensic context. \r\n\r\nIn the last 15 years, she has developed the disciplines of ecological (environmental) profiling and forensic palynology.  She has worked very closely with crime scene managers, senior investigating officers, forensic advisors, and other forensic scientists, and has established many of the standard crime scene protocols for obtaining environmental evidence.  She has worked on over 200 cases, many of which have been very high profile. She has worked with every police force in England, Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland, and Wales.  She has also worked with four of the Scottish Police forces. She is an experienced expert witness. \r\n\r\nShe set up an M.Sc. in Forensic Archaeological Science at University College London and was responsible for much of the teaching in this course for 5 years.  She has taught at police training colleges in Britain, and runs specialised courses for individual police forces.  She has contributed to, and continues to participate in, M.Sc. courses in a number of universities including those at Strathclyde, King’s College London, Dundee, Bournemouth, Cranfield, and the Jill Dando Institute.  She is a Research Fellow at the University of Aberdeen and University of Gloucestershire.  She has published extensively in ecology, botany, palynology, and archaeology - and in the forensic aspects of these disciplines.  She was Secretary of The British Association for Human Identification between 2005 and 2007.  She has professional status as a forensic scientist, and is a Fellow of the Linnean Society.\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 120, "image_id": null, "added": "2009-10-12T11:54:13", "slug": "botany-palynology-and-mycology-powerful-weapons-in-the-forensic-armoury", "speakers": [{"id": 8856, "name": "Patricia E.J.

The paper critically analyses white representations of African women, including the 'sable Venus'. More broadly it considers the ways in which African women negotiated new, and deeply unequal, relationships with Europeans in the context of the profound - and traumatic - changes in their lives created by the transatlantic slave trade. Key themes are cultural continuities between Africa and the Caribbean, the dynamics of change during the Middle Passage, and the ways in which African women were forced to embrace new identities as slaves within the developing race/ gender orders that emerged with the expansion of the slave trade.  The  \"Lost Daughter's of Afrik\" - referred to sympathetically in a contemporary abolitionist poem - are  the countless anonymous women slaves who made the journey of no return and are still remembered by their descendents in the African Diaspora. They experienced alienation and dislocation from kin and family but also demonstrated resilience and a capacity to resist and hold on to their personhood. Their odyssey to the Americas evokes sorrow but also the strength to resist enslavement and a desire to survive and to hold on to the cultural memory of Africa. \r\n\r\nBarbara Bush is a Professor of Imperial History at Sheffield Hallam University.

About the Institut français du Royaume-Uni\r\n\r\nFounded in 1910 by a private benefactor, the Institut français is the official French government centre of language and culture, one of the 150 Instituts troughout the world and one of  the oldest French cultural centres based abroad. The Language Centre offers a wide range of courses in general or specialised French language, while the Cultural Centre stresses two areas: French, European and World cinema and cutting-edge writing and thought.\r\n\r\nh4. The Language Centre\r\n\r\nThe Language Centre offers tuition to over 6000 students a year and has 75 carefully selected, highly professional tutors. Courses are continually being adapted to suit the requirements of our students. In addition to traditional language courses, we have courses covering French culture, current affairs and business French.\r\n\r\nh4. Ciné lumière\r\n\r\nLaunched by Catherine Deneuve in March 1998, Ciné lumière is an independent showcase for the very best in French, European and world cinema. Our repertory features some 600 screenings a year. Festivals, seasons, retrospectives, premieres, new releases, guest star appearances: Ciné lumière is an everyday festival. A public cinema with 300 seats, Ciné lumière is open to everyone. You don't have to be a member of the Institut français - nor do you have to speak French! All films are shown in original version with English subtitles.\r\n\r\nh4. The Multimedia Library\r\n\r\nOur multimedia library offers free access to 52 000 items: books, French newspapers and magazines, videos & DVDs, CDs  and CD-ROMs aimed at Francophiles, French speakers or learners. The library also supplies information services such as the Quick Information Service which provides information and documentation on contemporary France and francophone countries, and the Studies in France Information Desk which promotes cultural and educational exchanges between France and Great Britain.\r\n\r\nh4. Talks Programme\r\n\r\nThe Institut français has a varied programme of talks, giving a wide range of speakers the opportunity to express themselves freely and enter into a dialogue with the public. Thanks to the book launches our audiences are the first to know about the latest translations from French and publications about France.\r\n\r\nh4. French Music Bureau\r\n\r\nThe French Music Bureau is a unique collaboration between the French Government (Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Culture) and the domestic music industry to improve the profile of French popular music in both the UK and worldwide markets. The bureau aims to act as a consultant and offers assistance in the development of artists in every genre of French popular contemporary music. It is an essential communication resource, building a cultural network of coordination, advice, promotion and information with French, British and foreign media, educational institutions and music professionals. \r\n", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 262, "name": "Institut Francais", "slug": "institut-francais", "city": "London", "postcode": "SW7 2DT"}, "organizer": {"id": 262, "name": "Institut Francais", "slug": "institut-francais"}}]}, {"id": 1501, "title": "Health: an unhealthy obsession?", "synopsis": "A day of discussions to explore controversies surrounding modern medicine and healthcare.", "keywords": "Health, medicine, mmr, obesity, smoking public health, cancer, patients, doctors, behaviour modification", "body": "Government health campaigns, and increasing advertising for everything from cancer research to private health insurance, warn us that our health is in clear and present danger.
