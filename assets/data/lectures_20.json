[{"id": 16229, "title": "Platonic levels of Virtue, and the first step", "synopsis": "An survey of Platonic virtues as an ascending scale.", "keywords": "philosophy, plato, platonism,", "body": "The dialogues of Plato were at one time thought to constitute a complete moral education. In keeping with Plato's own view on this subject, which he outlines in the Republic, such education was thought to be of utmost importance not only in developing the integrity of the individual but also maintaining the integrity of society as a whole. Plato’s identification of the moral virtues rests on his characterisation of the human soul, which he thought acted through three faculties or parts: a part energised by reason, a part energised by raw desire, and a ‘spirited’ part energised by wholesome pride or ‘anger’ typically defined in relation to the other two parts.  Each part unfolded its potential through its own virtue (wisdom, temperance and fortitude) and when combined harmonized through a fourth, justice.  These four virtues became known as the ‘hinge’ or cardinal virtues. They were elucidated by almost 900 years of the Platonic tradition before being adopted and passed on to the Catholic church. Aristotle’s ethics was particularly influential in establishing this tradition of ‘virtue ethics’ because it was focused on its practical application. The neoplatonists, (Plotinus, Porphyry, Proclus, Iamblicus, Damascius, and Olympiodorus), were not only interested in how these virtues were expressed in practical or ‘civic’ activities, but also in more inward activities like contemplation and meditation. Compelled by the Socratic invocation to ‘know thyself’ not only as a human being in the world but also as a soul within a vast hierarchy of spiritual being, these four virtues were characterised differently depending on the level of being toward which they were focused. This resulted in a rich model of what we might call the inner dynamics of spiritual development. It also led to a course of Platonic studies aimed at the development of moral character. The study of Plato’s dialogue the First Alcibiades was pivotal in this curriculum because it was seen as the introduction to and therefore the foundation of the student’s moral development. It illustrates the crucial first step of turning inward, which Socrates characterises in the dialogue as recognising that one doesn’t know but one wants to know.  We will look at an outline of this framework of virtues, see how they were integrated into the cycle of Platonic dialogues and discuss its implications.\r\n \r\nNo previous experience of formal philosophy is required.\r\n\r\nEntrance in free, but donations between £3-5 will be welcomed.\r\n\r\nA PDF download of the extract we will be reading is available on our website together with further details of this and other Prometheus Trust's activities: www.prometheustrust.co.uk (the PDF is on the \"London Monday Evenings\" page.)\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 2510, "added": "2018-08-02T10:11:20", "slug": "platonic-levels-of-virtue-and-the-first-step", "speakers": [{"id": 16647, "name": "Stuart  Dunbar", "slug": "stuart-dunbar"}], "topics": [{"id": 1822, "name": "philosophy", "path": "/academic/religion/religion/philosophy"}, {"id": 2388, "name": "philosophy", "path": "/arts/literature/philosophy/philosophy"}, {"id": 365, "name": "platonism", "path": "/arts/philosophy/platonism"}, {"id": 316, "name": "philosophy", "path": "/arts/art/philosophy"}], "supercategory": "academic", "venue": {"id": 3106, "name": "Cecil Sharp House", "slug": "cecil-sharp-house", "city": "London", "postcode": "NW1 7AY"}, "organizer": {"id": 2041, "name": "The Prometheus Trust", "slug": "the-prometheus-trust"}, "date": "2018-08-13", "dates": [{"id": 16789, "from_date": "2018-08-13", "to_date": "2018-08-13", "time": "19:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Donation", "ticket_info": null, "additional_info": null, "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 3106, "name": "Cecil Sharp House", "slug": "cecil-sharp-house", "city": "London", "postcode": "NW1 7AY"}, "organizer": {"id": 2041, "name": "The Prometheus Trust", "slug": "the-prometheus-trust"}}]}, {"id": 16223, "title": "Book Talk: The Good Doctor of Warsaw", "synopsis": "In this event Elisabeth Gifford will speak about her new book The Good Doctor of Warsaw", "keywords": "WWII, history, genocide, library, Museums, war, Wiener Library, archive, research, Holocaust, free event, free entry, book talk, Janusz Korczak, Warsaw", "body": "In this event Elisabeth Gifford will speak about her new book The Good Doctor of Warsaw, which is based on the true story of one of Poland's greatest men, Dr Janusz Korczak.\r\n\r\nDeeply in love and about to marry, students Misha and Sophia flee a Warsaw under Nazi occupation for a chance at freedom.

However, it’s a bit confusing because we still appear to get free healthcare at the point of service. Who cares if it’s being taken over by ‘health trusts’? You can still get your hip replaced or a cancer removed … What’s all the fuss about?\r\n\r\nYoussef El-Gingihy’s accessible short book shows us why this attack on our most cherished public service is so important - a process that has been underway since the 1980s under Margaret Thatcher. Youssef provides a wealth of quite incredible information in 71 pages, so if you ever find yourself faced with a Tory offensive, you will be ready for the fight.\r\nAnd it’s not just a Tory problem; El Gingihy shows that every government over the past thirty years has contributed to the demise of the pride of the UK.

The long distance amateur championships attracted competitors from all over the world, while thousands gathered on wharves and barges to watch teenage champions like Agnes Beckwith. Channel hero Captain Webb used the Thames as his training ground, floating baths, pontoons and pools were created for bathers, exhibitionists Marie Finney and Jules Gautier daringly dived from London bridges. Caitlin Davies talks about how the Victorians swam the Thames.\r\n\r\nBack in the present day, London architects Studio Octopi have been developing a series of design proposals for re-introducing swimming in the tidal section of the River Thames. Chris Romer-Lee will set out evidence that the loss of public space along the foreshore and the increase in commercial river traffic is robbing Londoners of access to the river. Inspired by the Thames’ rich history of swimming, the designs look to reclaim the historic lifeblood of the city for Londoners. Join Studio Octopi on a journey that considers the options for swimming in the Thames today and in the future.\r\n\r\nLondoner Caitlin Davies is a writer, teacher, journalist, and general fair-weather swimmer. She is the author of five novels and five non-fiction books, including the forthcoming Downstream: a social history of swimming the River Thames (Aurum, 2015). In 2013 she was selected as a Royal Literary Fund Fellow in London.\r\n\r\nChris Romer-Lee is co-founder of the Thames Baths Project and architects Studio Octopi.

What had been a minor regional school achieved international prominence and influenced the future of European art in general for centuries. Central to this achievement was the genius of a succession of painters from Giovanni Bellini and his brother Gentile, Carpaccio, Giorgione, to the great Titian and his younger contemporaries Tintoretto and Veronese. These painters worked in a city undergoing crisis and change: the decline of its maritime empire, the reduction of its monopoly of trade with the East, its near destruction as a state in the early sixteenth century, and the religious turmoil engendered by the Reformation and the reaction of the Roman Church to it. Governed by an oligarchy of merchant nobles who elected a Doge, Venice remained politically stable throughout this turbulent period and continued to flourish economically. The state, the lay confraternities (called scuole) and private individuals provided sufficient patronage and support for a brilliant school of painting to develop in both secular and religious art. The cultural context and history of this school will be studied in eight lectures, followed by a full-day visit to the National Gallery to consider first-hand its outstanding collection of Venetian renaissance paintings.\r\n \r\n\r\n", "keywords": "arts, art, history, Renaissance Venice, Giovanni Bellini, Antonello da Messina, 'Sacra Conversazione', Titian, public paintings, eligious paintings, Habsburg rulers, Van Dyck, 'Assumption of the Virgin Mary' in the Franciscan church of the Frari, Giorgione, Gabriele Vendramin, Accademia  Gallery in Venice, High Renaissance' style, Alfonso d'Este, of Ferrara, Federico Gonzaga of Mantua, Bacchus and Ariadne' now in the National Gallery, Charles V, King Philip II of Spain, Jacopo Tintoretto,Counter-Reformation", "body": "This day will bring together all of the themes and developments considered over the course in a face-to-face examination of the National Gallery's especially rich collection of renaissance Venetian paintings.

In an age of intense religious conflict, church commissions were followed by the destruction of monasteries and their heritage and, as successive rulers impose their allegiances on the people, the arts trumpeted their chosen Faiths.

Without forecasting artistic trends or predicting future creation, 89plus manifests itself through panels, books, periodicals and exhibitions, bringing together individuals from a generation whose voices are only starting to be heard, yet which makes up nearly half of the world's population.\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 480, "image_id": null, "added": "2013-10-04T18:45:12", "slug": "bf512e7ba529e023", "speakers": [{"id": 4126, "name": "Hans Ulrich Obrist", "slug": "hans-ulrich-obrist"}], "topics": [{"id": 131, "name": "authors", "path": "/arts/literature/fiction/british/21stcentury/authors"}, {"id": 130, "name": "21stcentury", "path": "/arts/literature/fiction/british/21stcentury"}, {"id": 170, "name": "newtopic", "path": "/science/chemistry/biochemistry/catalysis/newtopic"}, {"id": 2893, "name": "architecture", "path": "/sport/olympics/londonolympics2012/architecture"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 2926, "name": "Serpentine Sackler Gallery", "slug": "serpentine-sackler-gallery", "city": "London", "postcode": "W2 2AR"}, "organizer": {"id": 166, "name": "Serpentine Galleries", "slug": "serpentine-galleries"}, "date": "2013-10-19", "dates": [{"id": 13595, "from_date": "2013-10-19", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "11:00:00", "ticket_cost": "Standard - One-day £15.50/£10.00, Standard - Two-day £20.00/£15.00", "ticket_info": "Standard - One-day £15.50\r\nConcession - One-day £10.00\r\n\r\nStandard - Two-day £20.00\r\nConcession - Two-day £15.00\r\n\r\nhttp://www.ticketweb.co.uk/search.php?tm_link=tm_header_search&language=en-us&keyword=89plus+marathon\r\n", "additional_info": "Tickets sold on the day at Serpentine Galleries", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 2926, "name": "Serpentine Sackler Gallery", "slug": "serpentine-sackler-gallery", "city": "London", "postcode": "W2 2AR"}, "organizer": {"id": 166, "name": "Serpentine Galleries", "slug": "serpentine-galleries"}}]}, {"id": 13051, "title": "Fighting Food Fraud - from Hassall to Horsemeat", "synopsis": "Playing Detective?", "keywords": "chemistry, Burlington House, food fraud, science, public event, public analysts, horsemeat", "body": "Food fraud has been around since food was traded and the further the distance that food travels the more likely it is to be adulterated.

With Dr. Stephen Law (Heythrop College University of London)\r\nHow to make a ludicrous belief system look not unreasonable. \r\n“But It Fits!” is one of the most popular strategies for immunizing beliefs against refutation” Stephen Law writes. “In fact, “But it fits!” does double duty. Not only is it a great immunizing strategy, it can also be used to create the illusion that a ridiculous belief system is not, after all, ridiculous, but at least as well confirmed as its rivals. I’ll explain how “But It Fits!” works by means of a particularly impressive example: Young Earth Creationism”.\r\n \r\n2.30pm Educational Imposters: The Rise of Pseudoscience in UK Free Schools with Andy Lewis (Quackometer).\r\n\"Michael Gove has stated that Free Schools will not be allowed to teach pseudoscience. But can we trust some of the cult-like organisations running these schools to teach good science is and to refrain from letting their own alternative reality influence classrooms?

Yet the question of what made us human cannot be solved without a focus on women, the moon and menstruation. African hunter-gatherer cosmology takes the lunar cycle as the crucial timeframe for ritual, sex and economic activities. The shared sources of this cosmology carry us back to earliest human symbolic culture, the very origins of art and ritual itself, over 100,000 years ago. These hunter-gatherer societies are among the most gender egalitarian on earth. But how does such egalitarianism work? Women especially assert power through their bodies collectively to resist any threat of male exploitation.

Central to the Parasol unit philosophy is a total commitment to artists and their creative endeavour, an attitude which leads to a singular relationship developing between each exhibiting artist and the foundation.\r\nEvery year the foundation organises four challenging and thought-provoking exhibitions of works in various media by contemporary artists, and also sets up a variety of other artistic projects. Each exhibition is accompanied by a publication and related educational events. The foundation does not bear the founder’s name, and its exhibitions are not derived from the founder’s collection. Admission to exhibitions is free of charge.\r\nParasol unit operates like publicly funded institutions in London. Currently 58% of the funding is provided by the founder and 42% through Gift Aid, charitable organisations, private donations and the sale of merchandise. The exhibition space has been put at the disposal of the foundation free of charge by the founder. Thanks to this new model between private funding and public support one of London’s most vibrant contemporary art spaces has come to exist. \r\n\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 180, "image_id": null, "added": "2012-03-01T16:29:22", "slug": "2fae39cb3a123e6c", "speakers": [{"id": 12093, "name": "Central St Martins", "slug": "central-st-martins"}], "topics": [{"id": 1869, "name": "performance", "path": "/arts/film/videoart/performance"}, {"id": 1573, "name": "media", "path": "/society/media/media/media"}, {"id": 1223, "name": "photography", "path": "/academic/history/africa/photography"}, {"id": 1273, "name": "photography", "path": "/politics/middleeast/palestineisraeliconflict/photography"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 1887, "name": "Parasol unit", "slug": "parasol-unit", "city": "London", "postcode": "N1 7RW"}, "organizer": {"id": 1887, "name": "Parasol unit", "slug": "parasol-unit"}, "date": "2012-03-14", "dates": [{"id": 11296, "from_date": "2012-03-14", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "2:00:00", "ticket_cost": "£6/£5 concessions for one seminar / £15/£10 concessions for three seminars ", "ticket_info": "FREE to students/staff at Goldsmiths and CSM, email Aman Sagoo a.sagoo@csm.arts.ac.uk to book. \r\n\r\nGeneral Public: £6/£5 concessions for one seminar / £15/£10 concessions for three seminars – Booking essential, please book your place via Parasol unit \r\n\r\n\r\nEvent Booking Information\r\nPayment: To secure your place payment can be made via phone (020 7490 7373), email (events@parasol-unit.org) or paypal (www.parasol-unit.org, please go to the events tab on the left)", "additional_info": "Booking is recommended for all events to avoid disappointment.", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 1887, "name": "Parasol unit", "slug": "parasol-unit", "city": "London", "postcode": "N1 7RW"}, "organizer": {"id": 1887, "name": "Parasol unit", "slug": "parasol-unit"}}]}, {"id": 10695, "title": "Lister as a Pathologist", "synopsis": "The last of 3 luchtime lectures celebrating the life of Joseph Lister in the centenary of his death.", "keywords": "Lister\r\nmedicine\r\nsurgery\r\nwatercolours\r\npathology\r\nscience\r\nmicroscopy", "body": "Although he is most celebrated for his contribution to surgery, Joseph Lister was also an expert in pathology – the study of how disease affects the body.

A new method will be described, which can show anatomy at the scale of millimetres and subcellular detail in the same image of a specimen such as a mouse embryo.

With John White and others in LMB, he pioneered the optomechanical development of the biological laser-scanning confocal microscope in the mid-80s and demonstrated its usefulness for biomedical work with fluorescent probes. This had world-wide impact in fields ranging from cell and developmental biology, neurobiology and even in fields of materials science such as geology. His main current interest is in extending the confocal microscope to cover larger volumes, so that every cell in a piece of tissue or entire mouse embryo 6mm long can be recorded in three dimensions with subcellular detail.\r\n\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 60, "image_id": null, "added": "2011-12-21T08:43:30", "slug": "how-new-science-is-transforming-the-optical-microscope", "speakers": [{"id": 11868, "name": "Dr Brad Amos FRS", "slug": "dr-brad-amos-frs"}], "topics": [{"id": 1070, "name": "anatomy", "path": "/academic/medicine/anatomy"}, {"id": 814, "name": "optics", "path": "/science/physics/optics"}, {"id": 778, "name": "engineering", "path": "/science/engineering/engineering/engineering"}, {"id": 2779, "name": "microscope", "path": "/science/technology/microscope"}], "supercategory": "academic", "venue": {"id": 44, "name": "The Royal Society", "slug": "the-royal-society", "city": "London", "postcode": "SW1Y 5AG"}, "organizer": {"id": 44, "name": "The Royal Society", "slug": "the-royal-society"}, "date": "2012-02-13", "dates": [{"id": 11028, "from_date": "2012-02-13", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "18:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": "Admission free – no ticket or advance booking required.

Tonight's speaker is one such. In this chaos magick, becoming-woman is the primary gender, queer is pure daemonic copulation, death is not foiled by transcendence but its own life-force at the limit; and ethics and commitment are inherent. Patricia challenges original formulations of the system. Not seeking to replace chaos's stereotypes, she shows that its various origins required multiplicity, incommensurability and a future with multiple, mistaken pasts.

Given that Labour created over 3000 new criminal offences, one for each day they were in power, this proposed slashing of legal aid raised the question of who is supposed to defend those accused of all these new offences. The new coalition government has announced its intention to put a stop to the creation of ‘needless’ new criminal offences, yet the question of how the Ministry of Justice is to manage budget cuts of £320 million has been left up in the air. Criminal legal aid is still under threat. \r\n\r\nIn spite of the gravity of the situation, legal aid is rarely discussed by anybody outside the legal profession. Further, it seems that any positive case lawyers make for legal aid is greeted with accusations of overt self-interest and greed. Is the right to choose your own lawyer, which depends on the availability of legal aid, still important? Or is it a waste of funds that would be better spent on preventing crime happening in the first place?

We want your ideas on how to change that, ideas on how we restore hard-won freedoms that have been lost’. Did Nick Clegg’s call for people to suggest illiberal or coercive laws they want to abolish mark the beginning of a new era of liberty? The idea seems promising, but is it just an empty gesture, another ‘listening campaign’ to make us feel good? Are we being presented with freedom as soundbite rather than a real debate about the issues? \r\n\r\nIn today’s cautious and conservative political climate, the foundational freedoms - freedom of speech, freedom to organise and the negative liberty of not having the state intruding into our private lives - are less likely to be supported and are rarely fought for. Is it merely cynical to suppose that the freedom to sack employees is more likely to come out any consultation than the freedom to say what you like? The idea of consultation continues a political tradition of the elite conferring rights rather than the public seeing freedom as being something we have to fight for. Indeed, it sometimes seems most people are not that interested in freedom. The last government’s efforts to deal with ‘antisocial behaviour’ were popular despite their illiberalism. If people value security above all else, freedom is unlikely to become a truly popular cause. So is freedom just a matter of governments removing laws that restrict freedoms or enacting laws that protect freedom? Don’t we need a real campaign over what matters rather than passively filling in consultation forms on a website? \r\n\r\nDoes today’s backlash against the ‘nanny state’ signal a new era of liberty?

Such protected freshwater sites present a major challenge due to the fact that many pressures arise off-site (i.e. within the wider catchment); the wide range of different human activities which operate in those catchments and which affect freshwater ecosystems; and the complex interactions between such activities.  Pollution remains one of these key pressures.  Over recent years there has been extensive investment in tackling major point sources of pollution, and country wide initiatives are underway which aim to deal with diffuse pollution and its effects on SSSIs. \r\nBut how do we determine our objectives for managing pollution in areas designated for nature conservation?  What powers and measures do we have to deal with this problem and how do we determine responsibility for action where there may be multiple causes of a problem?

About the Clarendon Lectures in Finance\r\n\r\nIn 1987 <a href=\"http://www.oup.com\">Oxford University Press</a> (the Press) established the Clarendon Lectures in Economics, the first in  what has become a wide range of Clarendon Lectures series. \r\n\r\nThe Press sponsors the visit to Oxford of a distinguished economist who delivers three public lectures to undergraduates, graduates and faculty members from Oxford and nearby universities. The lectures form  the basis of a book which is published by the Press. Many of these books have made a notable contribution to the literature.\r\n\r\nTo reflect the growth of the academic study of Finance in Business Schools and Economics Faculties generally and in particular in our own Saïd Business School the Press has established a series of Clarendon Lectures in Finance.\r\n", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 285, "name": "Saïd Business School, Summer Finance Symposium", "slug": "saïd-business-school-summer-finance-symposium", "city": "Oxford", "postcode": "OX1 1HP"}, "organizer": {"id": 284, "name": "Saïd Business School, Marketing and Communications", "slug": "saïd-business-school-marketing-and-communications"}}]}]
