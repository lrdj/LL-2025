This idealistic vision of what civil society could and should achieve in the Czech Republic, in Bosnia-Herzegovina, or in Serbia paid little heed to the realities of established western democracies. \r\n\r\nFrom various perspectives – environmental activism, judicial reform, minority rights – this lecture explores the complexities and contradictions of engaging citizens in the post-communist and post-conflict states of Europe. \r\n\r\nThe lecture will be followed by a networking drinks reception. \r\n\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 60, "image_id": 2577, "added": "2016-09-08T09:29:44", "slug": "347e18650f3673b8", "speakers": [{"id": 16305, "name": "Professor Adam Fagan", "slug": "professor-adam-fagan"}], "topics": [{"id": 2940, "name": "europe", "path": "/academic/history/european/history/earlymoderneuropeanhistory/eu"}, {"id": 2482, "name": "europe", "path": "/business/economy/growth/welfare/europe"}, {"id": 2692, "name": "history", "path": "/arts/finearts/film/film/history"}, {"id": 106, "name": "wwi", "path": "/arts/books/history/military/wwi"}], "supercategory": "academic", "venue": {"id": 3218, "name": "Skeel Lecture Theatre, People's Palace", "slug": "skeel-lecture-theatre-peoples-palace", "city": "London", "postcode": "E1 4NS"}, "organizer": {"id": 3213, "name": "Events Office, Queen Mary University of London", "slug": "events-office-queen-mary-university-of-london"}, "date": "2016-11-09", "dates": [{"id": 16091, "from_date": "2016-11-09", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "18:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": "https://whatwethoughtweknew.eventbrite.co.uk ", "additional_info": "For further information contact: b.prescott@qmul.ac.uk or visit www.qmul.ac.uk/events/meetprofessors/\r\n", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 3218, "name": "Skeel Lecture Theatre, People's Palace", "slug": "skeel-lecture-theatre-peoples-palace", "city": "London", "postcode": "E1 4NS"}, "organizer": {"id": 3213, "name": "Events Office, Queen Mary University of London", "slug": "events-office-queen-mary-university-of-london"}}]}, {"id": 15404, "title": "Faber Social: Jon Savage and Viv Albertine on Punk", "synopsis": "Two of the finest writers on Punk in conversation.", "keywords": "Punk, conversation, fashion, music", "body": "The British Library and Faber Social present a night of conversations on punk featuring two of the most important names associated with the scene, Viv Albertine (guitarist of The Slits and author of bestselling memoir Clothes, Clothes, Clothes.

Secondly, what is the relation of the individual to society and its laws?

The use of language is one of the series’ most distinctive features. It has been extensively explored by scholars from many disciplines. However, no-one has explored how vampires in BtVS are linguistically constructed. Transformations are a significant part of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. They include: being revived from the dead, being turned into a vampire, and having one’s soul restored as a vampire. In my research, I have been interested in vampire transformations and in how the language of the series is manipulated to show them. In this talk I will briefly present my findings and speculate about possible reasons for those linguistic choices. I will focus on two main vampires of the series, Angel and Spike, and discuss pivotal scenes for their transformations. I have analysed these scenes from four different angles: lexis, grammar, conversation analysis and (im)politeness strategies. Close examination of each of these aspects of the language used by the characters in question shows differences in their linguistic choices marking their change of identity.</p>\r\n<p>For queries and further information, please contact: Billy Clark <a href=\"mailto:b.clark@mdx.ac.uk\" target=\"_self\">b.clark@mdx.ac.uk</a></p>\r\n<p>All Welcome</p>\r\n<p>Directions and campus map available here: <a title=\"Hendon campus map and directions\" href=\"http://www.mdx.ac.uk/get-in-touch/directions-london\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.mdx.ac.uk/get-in-touch/directions-london</a></p>", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 2218, "added": "2014-11-11T11:25:19", "slug": "changing-identity-on-the-small-screen-transformations-vampires-and-language-in-buffy-the-vampire-s", "speakers": [{"id": 15222, "name": "Dr Malgorzata Drewniok", "slug": "dr-malgorzata-drewniok"}], "topics": [{"id": 736, "name": "grammar", "path": "/academic/arts/linguistics/grammar"}, {"id": 1539, "name": "stylistics", "path": "/academic/arts/linguistics/stylistics"}, {"id": 3715, "name": "vampires", "path": "/society/folklore/werewolf/vampires"}, {"id": 1333, "name": "linguistics", "path": "/academic/arts/linguistics/linguistics"}], "supercategory": "academic", "venue": {"id": 928, "name": "English, Middlesex University", "slug": "english-middlesex-university", "city": "London", "postcode": "NW4 4BT"}, "organizer": {"id": 928, "name": "English, Middlesex University", "slug": "english-middlesex-university"}, "date": "2014-11-18", "dates": [{"id": 14815, "from_date": "2014-11-18", "to_date": "2014-11-18", "time": "13:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": null, "additional_info": "All welcome.

The body becomes sex. Sex becomes a service. The story of the sex worker says: the Split Self is not only possible, it is the ideal”.\r\n\r\nTurning to the practice of surrogate motherhood, Kajsa Ekis Ekman identifies the same components: that the woman is neither connected to her own body nor to the child she grows in her body and gives birth to. Surrogacy becomes an extended form of prostitution. In this capitalist creation story, the parent is the one who pays. The product sold is not sex but a baby. \r\n\r\nPlease join us for a chance to discuss the issues with Kajsa Ekis Ekman. Kasja is a Swedish journalist, writer and activist.

When these illnesses occurred, the exorcist/ conjurer would speak of witchcraft attack: a counter-intuitive, out-of-the-ordinary (yet culturally accepted) diagnosis.

This often results in translocation becoming a showcase for conservation; proof that we are attempting something, and a way to generate public support and involvement.\r\n\r\n!> /assets/images/851.jpg!\r\nBirds are the major taxa in reintroduction projects globally, and provide excellent examples of the significant advances and failures that reintroduction practitioners have made. The overall success of bird reintroduction campaigns is often poor. Reintroduction practice has evolved with little scientific rigour and poorly established monitoring and reporting protocols. The result is we often fail to learn from our mistakes. Conservation science is increasingly addressing this issue and scientists involved in reintroduction procedures have a responsibility to coordinate and advance the expertise generated through their involvement.\r\n\r\n\r\n!< /assets/images/848.jpg!\r\nOf additional benefit is the wide scientific base reintroductions draw from. However, this raises its own problems. Wildlife ecologists, population modellers, geneticists, animal husbandry professionals, and veterinarians all contribute expertise with often differing, and sometimes conflicting, goals and approaches. There is a desperate need to coordinate our thinking across these disciplines to promote a stronger knowledge base for more efficient and successful reintroductions in the future. Our aim is to bring experts from these various fields together to present and discuss their views and answer questions about how to create a unified reintroduction framework.\r\n\r\nOrganised by Dr John Ewen, Professor Doug Armstrong, Kevin Parker & Dr Phil Seddon.\r\n\r\nIMAGE CREDITS: working with birds and locals: Phill Cassey; Robin Trap: Andrew Coffey; kokako: John Ewen.\r\n\r\nFor further details or to book your place, please see www.zsl.org/science/scientific-meetings/ or contact Joy Hayward, Scientific Meetings Coordinator, Zoological Society of London, Regent's Park, London NW1 4RY; tel: +44 (0) 207 449 6227; fax: +44 (0) 207 449 6411; e-mail: joy.hayward@zsl.org\r\n\r\n!/assets/images/849.jpg! !/assets/images/846.jpg! !/assets/images/850.jpg!", "additional_info": null, "duration": 480, "image_id": 818, "added": "2007-08-30T22:46:52", "slug": "4027f0e12231e1f7", "speakers": [{"id": 5822, "name": "Doug Armstrong, Massey University, New Zealand", "slug": "doug-armstrong-massey-university-new-zealand"}, {"id": 5826, "name": "John Ewen, Institute of Zoology, ZSL UK", "slug": "john-ewen-institute-of-zoology-zsl-uk"}, {"id": 5827, "name": "Kevin Parker, Massey University, New Zealand", "slug": "kevin-parker-massey-university-new-zealand"}, {"id": 5828, "name": "Philip Seddon, University of Otago, New Zealand", "slug": "philip-seddon-university-of-otago-new-zealand"}, {"id": 5829, "name": "full details of speakers can be found at", "slug": "full-details-of-speakers-can-be-found-at"}], "topics": [{"id": 999, "name": "biology", "path": "/science/biology/naturalhistory/biology"}, {"id": 752, "name": "conservation", "path": "/science/naturalhistory/conservation"}, {"id": 924, "name": "conservation", "path": "/academic/naturalhistory/conservation"}, {"id": 1002, "name": "conservation", "path": "/leisure/conservation/conservation"}, {"id": 676, "name": "naturalhistory", "path": "/academic/naturalhistory"}, {"id": 70, "name": "biology", "path": "/science/biology"}, {"id": 1105, "name": "ecology", "path": "/science/ecology"}, {"id": 468, "name": "naturalhistory", "path": "/science/naturalhistory"}, {"id": 467, "name": "zoology", "path": "/science/zoology"}], "supercategory": "science", "venue": {"id": 1029, "name": "London Zoo's Meeting Rooms", "slug": "london-zoos-meeting-rooms", "city": "London", "postcode": "NW1 4RY"}, "organizer": {"id": 685, "name": "The Zoological Society of London", "slug": "the-zoological-society-of-london"}, "date": "2008-05-09", "dates": [{"id": 4800, "from_date": "2008-05-09", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "9:00:00", "ticket_cost": "£120 for both days; £70 per day.

But, is there a universally shared comprehension of what constitutes ‘war crime’? How far has it been necessary, in defining and prosecuting war crimes in the modern age, to go beyond the articles of Geneva and other Conventions and customary international norms when dealing with grave incidents perceived as having an ‘international’ dimension? Does there need to be an international dimension to war crimes? How ‘new’ are war crimes, given that our conceptions of what constitutes a crime are often moulded and constrained by the past. How useful is it to visit the past (eg post-WW2 trials) given that these trials set precedents, definitions and norms of grave international crimes? It is also argued that international law is arcane and difficult: should it/how should it be made more accessible to non-specialist audiences? And how far should media and other public comments on war crimes be aware of the law if they are to report in a balanced and ethical fashion? What constitutes a ‘war zone’ requiring international intervention? Is it desirable to let states and societies work out their own solutions? A key focus will thus be on the strategies which are, or could be, utilised when dealing with war crimes, including ways in which these intersect with the more apparently ‘local’ concepts of hate crime and its management. The role of positive or negative stereotypes (often deeply rooted in historical prejudice) of race, gender, religion, sexuality etc associated with war crimes is also an issue with both theoretical and practical implications when identifying and prosecuting war crimes.

It was in 313 that he met with his ally in the East, Licinius, in Milan. Constantinople was founded in 324 and dedicated in 330. The first ecumenical council was held at Nicaea (Iznik as now) in 325.

Men, on the other hand, slowly became alienated from the means of reproduction, and surplus to biological requirements. These changes, he argues, have been reflected in an increasingly feminised education system, which is calibrated for girls rather than boys, and in societal contempt for traditional male pursuits. Men are also now increasingly outlaws and not in-laws as far as family life is concerned. Single motherhood - now a third of UK births - is one major consequence.

About the Institut français du Royaume-Uni\r\n\r\nFounded in 1910 by a private benefactor, the Institut français is the official French government centre of language and culture, one of the 150 Instituts troughout the world and one of  the oldest French cultural centres based abroad. The Language Centre offers a wide range of courses in general or specialised French language, while the Cultural Centre stresses two areas: French, European and World cinema and cutting-edge writing and thought.\r\n\r\nh4. The Language Centre\r\n\r\nThe Language Centre offers tuition to over 6000 students a year and has 75 carefully selected, highly professional tutors. Courses are continually being adapted to suit the requirements of our students. In addition to traditional language courses, we have courses covering French culture, current affairs and business French.\r\n\r\nh4. Ciné lumière\r\n\r\nLaunched by Catherine Deneuve in March 1998, Ciné lumière is an independent showcase for the very best in French, European and world cinema. Our repertory features some 600 screenings a year. Festivals, seasons, retrospectives, premieres, new releases, guest star appearances: Ciné lumière is an everyday festival. A public cinema with 300 seats, Ciné lumière is open to everyone. You don't have to be a member of the Institut français - nor do you have to speak French! All films are shown in original version with English subtitles.\r\n\r\nh4. The Multimedia Library\r\n\r\nOur multimedia library offers free access to 52 000 items: books, French newspapers and magazines, videos & DVDs, CDs  and CD-ROMs aimed at Francophiles, French speakers or learners. The library also supplies information services such as the Quick Information Service which provides information and documentation on contemporary France and francophone countries, and the Studies in France Information Desk which promotes cultural and educational exchanges between France and Great Britain.\r\n\r\nh4. Talks Programme\r\n\r\nThe Institut français has a varied programme of talks, giving a wide range of speakers the opportunity to express themselves freely and enter into a dialogue with the public. Thanks to the book launches our audiences are the first to know about the latest translations from French and publications about France.\r\n\r\nh4. French Music Bureau\r\n\r\nThe French Music Bureau is a unique collaboration between the French Government (Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Culture) and the domestic music industry to improve the profile of French popular music in both the UK and worldwide markets. The bureau aims to act as a consultant and offers assistance in the development of artists in every genre of French popular contemporary music. It is an essential communication resource, building a cultural network of coordination, advice, promotion and information with French, British and foreign media, educational institutions and music professionals. \r\n", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 262, "name": "Institut Francais", "slug": "institut-francais", "city": "London", "postcode": "SW7 2DT"}, "organizer": {"id": 262, "name": "Institut Francais", "slug": "institut-francais"}}]}, {"id": 1421, "title": "Portable Antiques Scheme", "synopsis": "An evening presentation with Anna Marshall, Find Liasion Officer for South and West Yorkshire.", "keywords": "Yorkshire, metal detecting, antiques", "body": "This talk will highlight the aims and achievemnets of the scheme and examine the role of the Local Finds Liaison Officer.

In his talk Sandu will explain this quantum non-locality at a very popular level (with NO mathematics).

These similarities mean that much of what is learned about what genes do in simple animals such as worms can help us understand what human genes do. Using a remarkable new technique called RNA interference (RNAi), we can quickly test the function of individual genes.
