This dimension of storytelling, called disnarration (Prince (1988, 2003) is defined as ‘The elements in a narrative that explicitly consider and refer to what does not take place i.e.. ‘X didn’t happen’; ‘Y could have happened but didn’t’ (Prince, 2003: 22). Here, the focus would still be on the unfolding events or complicating action even if the resolution is not what would be expected (Labov and Waletzky, 1967). If we understand that telling and exchanging personal narratives are a means for individuals to represent and shape their lives through their experiences, then the alternative, hypothetical scenario of what might have been, communicates what could have been serious and even life changing. For individuals who tell these types of experiences, they are also able to construct and reconstruct their identity using a number of linguistic devices, such as ‘self–aggrandizement’, which is ‘designed to place the narrator in the most favorable possible light’ (Labov and Waletzky,1967. In media stories, disnarration would still fulfil the criteria of newsworthiness (Bell, 1991; Galtung and Ruge, 1965, 1973) because the emphasis is on tellability and the possible consequences e.g. ‘Near miss reported between passenger jet, airplane’ (Star-Telegram, 28.5.2014). What of fictional accounts of disnarration where the emphasis is not on what happens but on what does not, specifically, what the protagonist, Anders does not remember at a critical moment. This paper explores these questions with an analysis of Tobias Wolff’s short story, Bullet in the Brain, to understand the device of disnarration in fiction and its effects on plot and characterisation.

This is based on an analysis of why the growth rates of countries differ, and what firms have to do to achieve competitive advantage in today’s global economy. \r\n\r\nThe cornerstone of the political economy of Progressive Capitalism is a belief in capitalism. But it also incorporates the three defining beliefs of progressive thinking. These are: the crucial role of institutions, the need for the state to be involved in their design to resolve conflicting interests, and the use of social justice as an important measure of a country’s economic performance. Social justice, defined as fairness, is used as a measure of performance in addition to the rate of economic growth and liberty. \r\n\r\nProgressive Capitalism shows how this new progressive political economy can be used by politicians and policy-makers to produce a programme of economic reform for a country. It does this by analysing and proposing reforms for the UK’s equity markets, its system of corporate governance, its national system of innovation, and its education and training system. \r\n\r\nFinally, Progressive Capitalism describes the role the state should play in the economy, which it sees as an enabling one rather than the command-and-control role of traditional socialism or the minimalist role of neoliberalism. \r\n\r\nDavid Sainsbury was Finance Director of J.

Award-winning journalist Jeremy Bowen has been the BBC's Middle East editor since 2005 and was on the ground for them as revolution swept through the region. Recognising this as a game-changing moment in the history of the Middle East, through the thoughts and feelings of the people involved, The Arab Uprisings|, Jeremy’s new book, which he will talk about in this lecture captures the violent foment of those heady days and follows the story as it has evolved over the months. With unparalleled access, Bowen examines how the unforeseen but infectious rebellion shook the Middle East and unseated its dictators, whilst also lifting the lid on the brutal police states, tribal loyalty, the influence of social media and the part that foreign help played. Putting these revolutions in their political context and giving insight into the broader history and evolving landscape of the Middle East, it is the story of a change that had once seemed impossible; how it happened and what it means. \r\n\r\nJeremy Bowen is Middle East editor for the BBC, having reported from Jerusalem for twelve years.

This seminar will also address the current moves to improve in-school assessment practice and will ask if such moves will produce greater reliability and confidence in the system.\r\n\r\nThis seminar is part of the Assessment Principles series of seminars presented by Andrew Watts, a Principal Consultant for the Cambridge Assessment Network Division. The series focuses on five key topics in assessment: the purposes of assessment; the relationship between assessment and learning; the development of assessments; the validity and the reliability of assessments. Each session addresses one of these topics. Though the topics are the same each year, up-to-date issues are discussed which focus on recent news stories or which represent the latest thinking in that area. The series is for those who want to take a broad view of the field of educational assessment, in company with others working in the field. Participants will be able to share their own experiences and perceptions, and to reflect on those of others.

Whether or not this conservation action will be in time to prevent Africa’s first mainland bird extinction remains to be seen.\r\n\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": null, "added": "2011-11-22T17:46:29", "slug": "d0de7b25c4876727", "speakers": [{"id": 11781, "name": "Dr Nigel Collar", "slug": "dr-nigel-collar"}, {"id": 11782, "name": "Paul Donald", "slug": "paul-donald"}], "topics": [{"id": 2509, "name": "ethiopia", "path": "/society/africa/ethiopia"}, {"id": 335, "name": "ornithology", "path": "/science/biology/ornithology"}, {"id": 752, "name": "conservation", "path": "/science/naturalhistory/conservation"}], "supercategory": "society", "venue": {"id": 2455, "name": "School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS)", "slug": "school-of-oriental-and-african-studies-soas", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC1 0XG"}, "organizer": {"id": 2452, "name": "The Anglo-Ethiopian Society", "slug": "the-anglo-ethiopian-society"}, "date": "2012-01-18", "dates": [{"id": 10820, "from_date": "2012-01-18", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "19:00:00", "ticket_cost": "Admission is free and everyone is welcome.", "ticket_info": null, "additional_info": "7:00pm, Room G3, Main Building, SOAS", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 2455, "name": "School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS)", "slug": "school-of-oriental-and-african-studies-soas", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC1 0XG"}, "organizer": {"id": 2452, "name": "The Anglo-Ethiopian Society", "slug": "the-anglo-ethiopian-society"}}]}, {"id": 10320, "title": "Crossing Borders - 25 October: Gill Clarke", "synopsis": "Independent Dance presents a series of talks with artists and academics whose particular practice has led them beyond narrow disciplinary boundaries.", "keywords": "Talk/ Seminar", "body": "Expanding the Frame\r\n\r\n‘We are in continuous movement, acting upon and responding to our environment.

Leadership and technological innovation.\r\n\r\n2pm-4pm, Saturday 15th August.\r\n\r\nWith James Woudhuysen, Professor of Forecasting & Innovation, De Montfort University, Leicester, UK.\r\n\r\nDescription:\r\n\r\nWhen Western elites say, as a response to concerns about climate change, that individual consumers must change their lifestyles and use less energy, they are really abdicating their own responsibility to develop a new, cheap, clean and reliable energy supply. They are scared of investing in nuclear power, scared of moving ahead in carbon capture and storage, and scared of developing new, efficient biofuels – whether on the land or in the laboratory. Public guilt about climate change is a waste of energy. Progress may have got us into this mess but it is also what is going to get us out of it.\r\n\r\nThis talk builds on elements of the speaker's recent book \"Energise! A future for energy innovation\" (co-authored with Joe Kaplinsky). This book has been described \"A cogent, widely researched analysis of the future of energy which will enable readers finally to distinguish fact from fiction\" and \"A hugely useful reframing of the debate\".

Our current science represses problematic assumptions about metaphysics, values and politics – but these need to be clearly acknowledged so that they can be thrown open to criticism, revision and improvement. \r\n\r\nWe need a new kind of science, having a basic aim to help humanity learn to become wiser and more civilized, rather than just acquiring factual knowledge.\r\n\r\nThis responsibility lies with philosophers – to bring about a revolution in the aims, methods, structure and character of academic inquiry, so that it takes up the proper task of helping humanity learn how to create a wiser world.

We work with over fifty grass-root organisations in more than thirty countries.  \r\n\r\nARTICLE 19 has pioneered free speech analysis relating to many aspects of our lives, including public health, environment, development and government accountability.  Over the last three years, we have monitored with great concern the effects of the so-called “war on terror”, including the growth in anti-terrorist legislation and state secrecy laws.  Intense pressures on journalists to be “loyal” and “patriotic” have strengthened self-censorship and deepened biases.  Media censorship has resurfaced where we thought it had been extinguished.  It has been given new impetus where we hoped it was dying.\r\n\r\nARTICLE 19 has also recorded globally the impact of economic globalisation on freedom of expression and the media.  Commercial pressures and media concentration have resulted, the world over, including in the UK, in increased “sponsored” journalism, erosion of public service broadcasting, and a rise in populist and entertainment reporting.  At the same time, we have also witnessed the capture of media by political or sectarian interests to inflame conflicts and propagate hatred.\r\n\r\nThese trends are not irreversible or inevitable.  Come and join us for this unique opportunity to discuss with Lord Puttnam the fresh start and partnership required to tackle the national and global set-backs to freedom of expression and freedom of information. \r\n\r\nCensorship and secrecy silence, starve, and kill.

More about _For Ever Godard_\r\n\r\nh4. Film retrospective 2&mdash;29 july 2004\r\n\r\nThere have been many unique talents in the history of cinema, but few can compare with the highly individual genius that is Jean-Luc Godard. He has been making films for almost half of cinema's own lifetime, and it was clear from the start&mdash;with his dazzling debut feature _Breathless_&mdash;that he was taking film into the future even as he was honouring its past. \r\n\r\nAs a new book addressing the multiple aspects of Godard's cinema is launched&mdash;_For Ever Godard_ (Black Dog Publishing)&mdash;we re-examine some of his key works in the company of filmmakers, critics, academics and Godard's own collaborators - Raoul Coutard and Antoine Duhamel - to discover how one of cinema's most notorious 'enfants terribles' has evolved into an elder statesman without ever losing his talent for invention or his taste for exuberant provocation.\r\n\r\nOur season features films from every period of Godard's mercurial career, and looks forward to the forthcoming release of his latest work, _Notre musique_. Godard is blessed with a musical eye and a visual ear, and sound plays a vital role in his work: he is a determinedly audio-visual artist whose films bear comparison with works by the great modern composers. Constantly pushing the boundaries of cinema, Godard does not always succeed, but his failures make some others' successes appear pallid and empty. His films are playful, challenging, engaging, demanding, entertaining and illuminating, but never boring. He has been an inspiration for generations of international filmmakers, so much so that his famous 1958 declaration (\"Cinema *is* Nicholas Ray\") might now be rewritten: for many true lovers of film, Cinema *is* Jean-Luc Godard.\r\n\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": null, "image_id": 183, "added": "2004-07-14T13:44:22", "slug": "b449acecad1de829", "speakers": [{"id": 1264, "name": "Chris Darke", "slug": "chris-darke"}], "topics": [{"id": 470, "name": "french", "path": "/arts/film/french"}, {"id": 19, "name": "retrospectives", "path": "/arts/film/retrospectives"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 262, "name": "Institut Francais", "slug": "institut-francais", "city": "London", "postcode": "SW7 2DT"}, "organizer": {"id": 262, "name": "Institut Francais", "slug": "institut-francais"}, "date": "2004-07-15", "dates": [{"id": 1082, "from_date": "2004-07-15", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "20:00:00", "ticket_cost": "Tickets £7, 5£ Members and Concessions", "ticket_info": "\"Box-Office\":http://www.institut-francais.org.uk/cinema/ci_boxoffice.php \r\n\r\nContact - 0207 073 1350 \r\n\r\n* Members of the Institut français and Cin&eacute; Lumi&egrave;re £ 5 \r\n* School &amp; group rates (more than 10 people) £3\r\n* Double bill, special events and premières £9, Concessions £7. \r\n\r\nPayment by Credit card (Visa, Delta, Switch, Mastercard) or cheque.\r\n\r\nh3.
