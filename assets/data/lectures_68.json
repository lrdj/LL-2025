Now, in the essay collection ‘The View from the Train’ (Verso, 2013), he offers a new perspective on how Britain works and sees itself. \r\n\r\nKeiller discusses the background to his work and its development - from surrealism to post-2008 economic catastrophe - and expands on what the films reveal. Referencing writers including Benjamin and Lefebvre, the essays follow his career since the late 1970s, exploring themes including the surrealist perception of the city; the relationship of architecture and film; how cities change over time, and how films represent this; as well as accounts of cross-country journeys involving historical figures, unexpected ideas and an urgent portrait of post-crash Britain.\r\n\r\nPatrick Keiller is a film-maker whose works include ‘London’ (1994), ‘Robinson in Space’ (1997), and most recently ‘Robinson in Ruin’ (2010).

The quality and orientation of a translation can indeed be held as an indicator of the broader socio-political dynamics that divide and stratify society. This requires us to rethink what, exactly, is invested and enacted in translation. What is it that ‘takes place’ in the translational act?

This talk will focus thematically upon a specific conceptual shift. Today’s religious-reformist intellectuals articulating Iran’s contemporary mass movement for democracy draw their vision of change from the social sciences rather than philosophy, reflecting complex underlying conceptual-theoretical and organizational-practical shifts since the long struggle over independence and the future that shaped the twentieth century. In the 1950s a radical intellectual shift had taken place from a discourse of progress and science to a different discourse focusing on issues of authenticity, nativism or anti-Enlightenment. The Iranian reform movement, with its origins in the 2nd of Khordad Front, changed the terms of public discourse from the ideologically closed post-revolutionary worldview grounded in the Heideggerian philosophical concepts Bazghash be khish (return to roots/self) and Gharbzadegi (Westoxication) to an open-ended pragmatic politics dedicated to Weberian principles of asadi (liberty) and jam’eh-e madani (civil society) based on predictability of legal procedure (i.e. constitutionalism, citizenship and human rights) – a significant shift from ontology to pragmatics. \r\n\r\nAli Mirsepassi is professor of Middle Eastern studies and sociology and director of the Iranian Studies Initiative at New York University, and Visiting Professor in the Department of Sociology at LSE during MT 2013.", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 732, "added": "2013-09-12T05:48:52", "slug": "e8a4de4c39701e37", "speakers": [{"id": 14054, "name": "Professor  Ali  Mirsepassi", "slug": "professor-ali-mirsepassi"}], "topics": [{"id": 1181, "name": "iran", "path": "/politics/international/iran"}, {"id": 2962, "name": "iran", "path": "/politics/middleeast/iran"}], "supercategory": "politics", "venue": {"id": 2796, "name": "Sheikh Zayed Theatre (New Academic Building, LSE)", "slug": "sheikh-zayed-theatre-new-academic-building-lse", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC2A 3LJ"}, "organizer": {"id": 1287, "name": "London School of Economics & Political Science", "slug": "london-school-of-economics-political-science"}, "date": "2013-11-07", "dates": [{"id": 13490, "from_date": "2013-11-07", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "18:30:00", "ticket_cost": "FREE", "ticket_info": "This event is free and open to all with no ticket required.

In his Conway Hall presentation, Dr Blackford will focus on the much-debated connection between the rise of modern science and the rise of modern atheist thought. Although it is often claimed that religion and science are compatible, this is, at best, seriously misleading. In fact, science has contributed significantly to the historical erosion of religious belief. The more we develop a worldview based on reason, and particularly on scientific investigation, the less plausible religion becomes.

Some figures, including Mary Macarthur, who helped the women chainmakers of Cradley Heath win the right to a fair wage in 1910, were good to the point of saintliness; others mixed the admirable with the morally dubious: the composer Peter Warlock rented a cottage in the Kentish village of Eynsford where he composed a gentle song cycle, but set net curtains twitching by his hard drinking and naked motorbike riding. In Bright Particular Stars quiet, unassuming streetscapes are transformed in to beguiling, eccentric and uproarious sites of action which - through the eyes of David McKie - are once more filled with the great triumphs and failures of the visionaries that have each, in their own way, helped shape our island's rich and chequered history. \r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 60, "image_id": null, "added": "2011-03-18T15:20:15", "slug": "f1fb12a35a9fb55e", "speakers": [{"id": 10948, "name": "Mr David Mckie", "slug": "mr-david-mckie"}], "topics": [{"id": 131, "name": "authors", "path": "/arts/literature/fiction/british/21stcentury/authors"}, {"id": 130, "name": "21stcentury", "path": "/arts/literature/fiction/british/21stcentury"}, {"id": 129, "name": "british", "path": "/arts/literature/fiction/british"}, {"id": 2469, "name": "british", "path": "/arts/literature/british"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 2153, "name": "The Wheatsheaf", "slug": "the-wheatsheaf", "city": "London ", "postcode": "W1T 1DG"}, "organizer": {"id": 2149, "name": "Sohemian Society", "slug": "sohemian-society"}, "date": "2011-04-12", "dates": [{"id": 10020, "from_date": "2011-04-12", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "19:30:00", "ticket_cost": "£3", "ticket_info": "From door on evening.", "additional_info": "Website:www.sohemians.com", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 2153, "name": "The Wheatsheaf", "slug": "the-wheatsheaf", "city": "London ", "postcode": "W1T 1DG"}, "organizer": {"id": 2149, "name": "Sohemian Society", "slug": "sohemian-society"}}]}, {"id": 9539, "title": "LONDON’S SMALLER ART COLLECTIONS", "synopsis": "A gallery-based course which aims to explore London’s lesser-known and often overlooked art collections.

Social workers, teachers, psychologists, therapists and counsellors all agree levels of depression, anxiety, stress, self-harm, and disorders like Attention Deficit and Hyper-Activity Disorder are growing. According to UNICEF, British children are the unhappiest in Europe. Certainly, there is an increase in those treated for mental health-related problems. Recent reports suggest there has been a 65% increase in spending on drugs to treat ADHD over the last four years. Meanwhile, the health service issued 39.1m prescriptions for drugs to tackle depression in England in 2009, compared with 20.1m in 1999 – a 95% jump.  \r\n\r\nYet there is disagreement about what all this really means. Some say there is a growing problem with our mental health, requiring preventative interventions in schools and more resources for those diagnosed with problems. Others say there is over-diagnosis and a ‘victim culture’, and that remedies aimed at those who are not really ill not only waste limited resources, but are potentially harmful. Debates rage about whether GPs, and indeed teachers, are trigger-happy in recommending drugs such as Ritalin to deal with behavioural problems. Others suggest schools employ counsellors, psychotherapists and ‘talking therapies’. Still others charge that the ‘medical’ label ADHD may be an easy alternative to dealing with simple bad behaviour.\r\n\r\nSo have we become a nation of psychologically fragile individuals, influenced by popular ‘therapeutic’ culture to see ourselves as depressed or emotionally-unwell, in need of professional help? Or is life genuinely more difficult for more people than in the past, especially within the context of the economic downturn? A survey for the mental health charity Mind, which asked people if they had sought help for work-related stress since the downturn began, found 7% had begun medical treatment for depression and 5% had started counselling. Are increasing numbers seeking treatment because of greater awareness, reduced stigma and improved diagnosis, or is the problem ‘over-diagnosis’, fuelled by professional self-interest and clever marketing by pharmaceutical companies? Some insist the spectrum of symptoms and behaviours now seen as emotional disorders in fact includes perfectly normal responses to life’s emotional trials. So do we just need to pull ourselves together, or do we really need help to cope with a distressing world?

While such bans have been hailed variously as a victory for female emancipation and assertion of Western secular values over religious privilege, critics counter that such bans are an attack on freedom in general, and consider them a gross overreaction to a practice limited to a tiny minority in these societies.\r\n\r\nWhile enthusiasm for such bans in the UK has been muted, and widely thought to be against the British tradition of tolerance and personal liberty, other religious groups feel their freedom is under threat. From equality legislation which interferes with religious organisations’ right to employ those who share their moral code, to the leaking of Home Office emails which mockingly suggested for the Pope should visit abortion clinics during his visit, Christian groups regularly complain they are singled out for criticism. The fall-out from the Catholic care home abuse scandals even led to some prominent atheist and humanist commentators calling for the Pope’s arrest for crimes against humanity; a more widespread view holds abuse as a damning indictment of the ‘behind closed doors’ hierarchy of the Vatican. Beyond Catholicism, concern is spreading across secular and liberal Western religious circles alike about the apparent rise of fundamentalism across all faiths: from evangelical US churches, ultra-Orthodox Israeli Jews and hard-line Islamists. \r\n\r\nCan a secular society uphold its values of tolerance without encroaching on the rights and freedoms of religious groups? Are some liberals guilty of complacency in underestimating the growth of religion, or is the return to a sense of moral value actually something to celebrate in an otherwise relativist age ? Do forceful interventions, such as banning religious symbols or equality legislation, actually risk deepening divisions rather than challenging them?  Is ‘militant secularism’ really just a call for state-enforced atheism, or is its influence overstated by thin-skinned religious leaders looking to play the victim card? With both sides in the burqa debate laying claim to Enlightenment values, just what does it mean to be secular today?

In 2005 a group of Torino city councillors tried to ban Coca-Cola from city hall before the Winter Olympics, while from Canada to France, many countries impose music quotas on radio stations to help local artists get a footing in ‘an industry that is largely overshadowed by a gigantic American influence.’ From McDonalds to MTV, popular US brands are often interpreted as both a sign of America’s rampant commercialism and its superficial ‘trash’ culture. But is this a fair or full picture? \r\n\r\nAccusations that American culture is dumbing down the world are often thinly veiled attacks on popular culture per se. Such snobbery is often misplaced: there is more to US culture than Hollywood blockbusters, with American artists being leading lights in many art forms. From Philip Roth to The Wire, from the Guggenheim to Leonard Bernstein, from F Scott Fitzgerald to John Ford, America’s cultural achievements have broken new ground and many remain monumental. Moreover, America a place where artists from diverse backgrounds have come together to forge new and distinctive art, where two Russian émigrés like George Balanchine and Igor Stravinsky could create ballets that not only defined American dance but modern dance to this day.

The differences are less obvious, but run deep, and tonight's speaker considers these. There are so many imponderables, it can be overwhelming. Questions seem to outnumber answers, and the over-confident hardly inspire certainty in those who value nuanced insight.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow can today's European witches, reciting Shelley in BBC accents in the elegant Sussex downs, claim anything in common with Balinese medicine men? How can taking drugs make you believe you can heal others?  Can you speak of The Feminine Principle and not, actually, objectify women? What difference does ritual really make (or is it just self-indulgent). What difference does recycling make, when people are dying of loneliness? Awkward questions with no easy answers show us the rough edges of these various paradigms.

The central seminal figure in this computer revolution was Alan Turing, whose outstanding originality and vision was what made it possible, in work originating in the mid 1930s.  Although it is now hard to see what the limits of the computer revolution might eventually be, it was Turing himself who pointed out to us the very existence of such theoretical limitations.  \r\n\r\nIn honour and recognition of Turing’s contribution in the field of computing, the IEE (as the IET was then) and the BCS established the Turing Lecture with the first lecture being presented in 1999.  It is a world leading event, presenting a topic from current research in computer science and given by an acknowledged expert in the field.  The lecture has routinely had audiences of over 400 delegates at the London lecture.  It is also usually toured around UK cities with some of the lectures in the past being held in Cardiff, Edinburgh, Glasgow and Manchester.\r\n\r\nThe content of the lecture is published in the BCS's Computer Journal and available for viewing on IET.tv.

The context is the 250 Years Anniversary of the Battle of Plassey (23 June 1757), a decisive day when the British conquered Bengal under the leadership of Robert Clive. It was also the beginning of the British Indian Empire, under the banner of the English East India Company. The 250 Years anniversary events of the British conquest of Bengal (organized by Brick Lane Circle during June 2007) provided a focus for generating interest in learning about the shared heritage of East London.\r\n\r\nThe young people recruited will undertake research on a number of East India Company sites in East London, an area dotted with important locations and buildings that have historical links with Bengal. It is also the home of the largest concentration of Bangladeshi people in the UK. The researchers will be primarily recruited from the London Borough of Tower Hamlets and given workshops, guided tours, mentoring support and assistance in conducting and writing their research. These activities will help familiarise participants about important East India Company sites and their historical links with Bengal and also provide guidance on the sources of information. The workshops will include photography, planning and team work sessions. The research findings will be put together in a publication, to be launched in October 2008 Black History Month at a specially organized event. An exhibition illustrating the work of the young people, historical paintings, photographs and/or important documents will accompany the publication. The information will be made electronically available and an education pack will be developed and distributed.\r\n\r\nARE YOU ENTHUSIASTIC AND CAN UNDERTAKE QUALITY RESEARCH?

Captive breeding and re-introduction of native species has been practiced in Britain for centuries and in recent years has contributed to targeted conservation initiatives. Successes include re-establishment of the large blue butterfly (extinct in 1979)at three core sites in south-west England.\r\nIn 1991 the UK government formally adopted captive breeding and reintroduction as a tool for conserving native species with the establishment of English Nature’s Species Recovery Programme (SRP).
