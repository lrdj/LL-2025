They used sex, intimate relationships and drugs to build their credibility. They betrayed friends, deceived lovers, even fathered children. And their operations continue today.\r\n\r\nThis was an undercover operation so secret that some of our most senior police officers had no idea it existed. The job of the clandestine unit was to monitor British ‘subversives’ – environmental activists, anti-racist groups, animal rights campaigners.\r\n\r\nPolice stole the identities of dead people to create fake passports, driving licences and bank accounts. They then went deep undercover for years, inventing whole new lives so that they could live incognito among the people they were spying on.\r\n\r\nThey used sex, intimate relationships and drugs to build their credibility. They betrayed friends, deceived lovers, even fathered children. And their operations continue today.\r\n\r\nUndercover reveals the truth about secret police operations – the emotional turmoil, the psychological challenges and the human cost of a lifetime of deception – and asks whether such tactics can ever be justified.\r\n\r\nRob Evans has been a reporter for the Guardian since 1999. With a colleague Paul Lewis, he wrote a book, Undercover, about the infiltration of undercover police officers into political groups over the past 40 years.  He is also the author of Gassed: British chemical warfare experiments on humans at Porton Down (House of Stratus, 2000).

The main focus of her research is religion and ideology in the cultures giving rise to the biblical texts. She is also noted for her media roles: presenting a three-part television series on the BBC, Bible’s Buried Secrets, and for contributions to numerous television and radio documentaries about religion. She also appears regularly on BBC 1’s flagship religion and ethics debate programmes The Big Questions and Sunday Morning Live. She describes herself as “an atheist with huge respect for religion” and regards her work as “a branch of history like any other”.\r\n\r\nProf Richard Wiseman is based at the University of Hertfordshire, where he holds Britain’s only Chair in the Public Understanding of Psychology. He has gained an international reputation for research into unusual areas of psychology, including luck, deception, and the science of self-help.\r\n\r\nHis three books, The Luck Factor, Quirkology and 59 Seconds, have all topped the best-seller lists and have been translated into over 30 languages. He has presented keynote addresses at The Royal Society, Microsoft, Caltech, and Google. Over two million people have taken part in his mass participation experiments, and his YouTube channel has received over 11 million views.\r\n\r\nHe is one of the most frequently quoted psychologists in the British media, and was recently listed as one of the top 100 people who make Britain a better place to live in The Independent on Sunday.\r\n\r\nAlice Herron is a PhD candidate at the University of Surrey. She was brought up in Glasgow in an Irish Catholic family, educated in a convent school, married a Muslim, got divorced and then spent 27 years as the devotee of the Indian Guru Sri Chinmoy.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving that group, partly to make sense of that experience, she studied for a Master’s Degree in Psychology of Religion at Heythrop College, University of London. Her Master’s dissertation was titled Psychological Factors in the Emergence of New Religious Movements. She is currently researching atheists who claim to have had some sort of mystical-type experience.\r\n\r\nBruce Hood is Professor of Developmental Psychology at the University of Bristol. He is an elected Fellow of the Association for Psychological Science, the Royal Institution of Great Britain, the Royal Society of Biology and the British Psychological Society. He is currently the President of the British Association for Science psychology section. In 2011, Bruce gave the Royal Institution Christmas Lectures “Meet Your Brain” and he has written three popular science books; SuperSense: Why We Believe In The Unbelievable (HarperOne, 2009), The Self Illusion: Why There is No ‘You’ Inside Your Head (Constable and Robinson, 2012) and The Domesticated Brain (Pelican, 2014).

The screening will be followed by a panel discussion with the film's director Jean-Phillipe Tremblay, POLIS director Charlie Beckett and others to be confirmed. \r\n\r\nThe LIDF is the UK’s largest documentary festival. Running each year for over a week, it takes place at many venues across London and offers an unprecedented snapshot of the contemporary world as seen through the preoccupations of documentary filmmakers. Alongside established names like Martin Scorsese and Steve Soderberg, the festival also presents the best emerging talent from around the globe.\r\n\r\nThe films are always both pretext and context for discussion. Always entertaining, moving, and provocative. The LIDF adopts a questioning, critical attitude to the cultural, social and political issues of the day, engaging with filmmakers, their subjects, academics, cultural commentators, and our audience to create a highly distinct public forum for dialogue and interaction.\r\n\r\nThe LIDF 2012| runs from 24th May to 2nd June at various venues.

Central to the Parasol unit philosophy is a total commitment to artists and their creative endeavour, an attitude which leads to a singular relationship developing between each exhibiting artist and the foundation.\r\nEvery year the foundation organises four challenging and thought-provoking exhibitions of works in various media by contemporary artists, and also sets up a variety of other artistic projects. Each exhibition is accompanied by a publication and related educational events. The foundation does not bear the founder’s name, and its exhibitions are not derived from the founder’s collection. Admission to exhibitions is free of charge.\r\nParasol unit operates like publicly funded institutions in London. Currently 58% of the funding is provided by the founder and 42% through Gift Aid, charitable organisations, private donations and the sale of merchandise. The exhibition space has been put at the disposal of the foundation free of charge by the founder. Thanks to this new model between private funding and public support one of London’s most vibrant contemporary art spaces has come to exist. \r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 60, "image_id": null, "added": "2012-03-01T16:29:16", "slug": "drawing-on-medicine-a-talk-by-dr-ken-arnold-of-the-wellcome-collection", "speakers": [{"id": 2611, "name": "Dr Ken Arnold", "slug": "dr-ken-arnold"}], "topics": [{"id": 170, "name": "newtopic", "path": "/science/chemistry/biochemistry/catalysis/newtopic"}, {"id": 910, "name": "science", "path": "/arts/film/documentary/science"}, {"id": 1823, "name": "science", "path": "/academic/religion/religion/science"}, {"id": 169, "name": "catalysis", "path": "/science/chemistry/biochemistry/catalysis"}, {"id": 2846, "name": "installation", "path": "/arts/art/sculpture/publicart/installation"}], "supercategory": "science", "venue": {"id": 1887, "name": "Parasol unit", "slug": "parasol-unit", "city": "London", "postcode": "N1 7RW"}, "organizer": {"id": 1887, "name": "Parasol unit", "slug": "parasol-unit"}, "date": "2012-03-07", "dates": [{"id": 11295, "from_date": "2012-03-07", "to_date": "2012-03-07", "time": "19:00:00", "ticket_cost": "£5/£4 concessions", "ticket_info": "Payment: To secure your place payment can be made via phone (020 7490 7373), email (events@parasol-unit.org) or paypal (www.parasol-unit.org, please go to the events tab on the left)", "additional_info": "Event Booking Information\r\nBooking is recommended for all events to avoid disappointment.", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 1887, "name": "Parasol unit", "slug": "parasol-unit", "city": "London", "postcode": "N1 7RW"}, "organizer": {"id": 1887, "name": "Parasol unit", "slug": "parasol-unit"}}]}, {"id": 10316, "title": "Hearing connections: the sonification of natural systems", "synopsis": "In this event we explore the meaning of connectedness in the natural world and its application to artistic practice.", "keywords": "sound", "body": "Composer and sound designer Nick Ryan invites Dr Daniel Glaser (Neuroscientist and Head of Special Projects in public engagement at the Wellcome Trust), artist, designer and programmer Daniel Jones and musician and physicist Dr John Matthias to explore the meaning of connectedness in the natural world and its application to artistic practice, the musical rhythmic properties of firing neurons in the human brain and how the dynamics of an ecosystem can be understood through sound.

To help them better the 47 won at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, an army of coaches, doctors and psychologists is at hand, along with a thriving sports technology industry, all backed by an unprecedented level of public and private investment. National ambitions aside, we all want to see exceptional performances from the world’s best athletes, such as Usain Bolt’s record-smashing sprints. Yet sometimes we are uneasy when athletes shatter old records, fearing it is artificial aids, and not the athlete’s individual effort, that accounts for the achievement. We seem to be hanging in a precarious balance between expecting a superhuman performance and fearing the crossing of nature’s boundaries.\r\n\r\nWhen particular technologies have been ‘too successful’, such as Graeme Obree’s bicycle and riding position, or polyurethane-coated swimsuits, they have been banned for giving an unfair advantage. Some, like Rebecca Adlington refused to use the new swimsuits for ethical reasons even before they were banned, claiming they are a form of ‘technological doping’. And with such high stakes to play for and constant advances in medicine, the temptation of actual chemical doping looms as large as ever, and it is hard to demarcate precisely the line between legitimate medical treatment and unfair artificial advantage. Many take such a hard line against doping, calling for life bans from the Olympics for athletes like Dwain Chambers, who has long served his sentence. Others point out that sport is a very unnatural pursuit, and the intensity of training and competition has become such that no doping techniques are as dangerous for the athlete’s body as the sport itself, many ‘doping’ techniques being necessary to restore the athletes’ body to a healthy state. Some argue that, as enhancement technologies become part of everyday life and the line between medicine and body enhancement is blurred, it will become increasingly difficult to keep them out of sport. They believe we should allow all sorts of enhancement technologies provided they are safe.\r\n\r\nSo where should we draw the line between the artificial and the natural in sport, between effective sports equipment and ‘technological doping’, between legitimate medical therapies and illegitimate, performance enhancement treatments, between the struggle to excel and the need to have fair and balanced competition, between the urge to go beyond the boundaries of human nature and the fear of losing our humanity?", "additional_info": null, "duration": 120, "image_id": 1572, "added": "2011-09-10T20:33:13", "slug": "a14eedafa0a8cefe", "speakers": [{"id": 6776, "name": "Dr David James", "slug": "dr-david-james"}, {"id": 1462, "name": "Professor Andy Miah", "slug": "professor-andy-miah"}, {"id": 11452, "name": "Jim  Parry", "slug": "jim-parry"}, {"id": 10127, "name": "Michele Ledda", "slug": "michele-ledda"}], "topics": [{"id": 1473, "name": "ethics", "path": "/academic/philosophy/cognitivescience/ethics"}, {"id": 47, "name": "sport", "path": "/leisure/outdoor/sport"}, {"id": 2349, "name": "sport", "path": "/academic/history/sport"}, {"id": 396, "name": "ethics", "path": "/politics/history/ethics"}], "supercategory": "academic", "venue": {"id": 2534, "name": "The Carriageworks", "slug": "the-carriageworks", "city": "Leeds", "postcode": "LS2 3AD"}, "organizer": {"id": 45, "name": "Institute of Ideas", "slug": "institute-of-ideas"}, "date": "2011-10-05", "dates": [{"id": 10525, "from_date": "2011-10-05", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "18:30:00", "ticket_cost": "£5 (£3 concessions) per person.", "ticket_info": "Tickets are available on the door: email Leeds Salon for more information.", "additional_info": null, "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 2534, "name": "The Carriageworks", "slug": "the-carriageworks", "city": "Leeds", "postcode": "LS2 3AD"}, "organizer": {"id": 45, "name": "Institute of Ideas", "slug": "institute-of-ideas"}}]}, {"id": 10081, "title": "Truth, Errors, and Lies: politics and economics in a volatile world", "synopsis": "Department of Management public lecture", "keywords": "politics, economics, international, poland, political economy, reform, policy, management", "body": "A key architect of Poland's successful economic reforms, Grzegorz Kolodko applies his far-reaching knowledge to the past and future of the world economy. \r\n\r\nGrzegorz Kolodko is professor of political economy at Kozminski University in Warsaw and was previously Poland's deputy prime minister.", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 732, "added": "2011-09-08T11:25:44", "slug": "4ffd947438efbdfc", "speakers": [{"id": 11405, "name": "Professor Grzegorz W Kolodko", "slug": "professor-grzegorz-w-kolodko"}], "topics": [{"id": 1015, "name": "economics", "path": "/politics/economics"}, {"id": 1991, "name": "politicaleconomy", "path": "/politics/economics/politicaleconomy"}, {"id": 820, "name": "international", "path": "/politics/international"}, {"id": 1640, "name": "economy", "path": "/society/media/news/economy"}, {"id": 92, "name": "economics", "path": "/academic/economics"}, {"id": 472, "name": "internationalrelations", "path": "/academic/internationalrelations"}], "supercategory": "politics", "venue": {"id": 2113, "name": "Sheikh Zayed Theatre", "slug": "sheikh-zayed-theatre", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC2A 2AE"}, "organizer": {"id": 1287, "name": "London School of Economics & Political Science", "slug": "london-school-of-economics-political-science"}, "date": "2011-10-13", "dates": [{"id": 10500, "from_date": "2011-10-13", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "18:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Free", "ticket_info": "Suggested hashtag for this event for Twitter users: #lsekolodko \r\n\r\nThis event is free and open to all with no ticket required.

The dialogue starts by drawing upon the traditional Greek myth of Theseus and the Minotaur, as well as Orphic initiations; Plato then explores five interlinked rational proofs of immortality; finally we hear Socrates' intuitive vision of the “true earth” before he calmly drains the cup of hemlock.

To date, the history of computer graphics has tended to be dominated by the record of American contributors, but in the CACHe project, Nick Lambert and his colleagues have revealed the history of the UK contribution in which John Lansdown was a key figure. An active early member of the Computer Arts Society, John pioneered the use of computing in architecture, dance, surface design, animation and in digital art per se, not just as a tool but as a generative system. He also led the group at Middlesex University to become the research centre it is today.\r\n\r\nNick will look at John Lansdown's thought in the 1960s-70s and reveal how clearly he foresaw the potentials and development of modern computer art. \r\n\r\n\r\n+++++++++++++++++++++ \r\n\r\nIf you would like to attend this lecture, please email LCEAinfo@mdx.ac.uk.\r\n\r\nAny enquires to Stephen Boyd Davis:  s.boyd-davis@mdx.ac.uk \r\n\r\n++++++++++++++++++++++++ \r\n\r\n\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 60, "image_id": 662, "added": "2006-12-01T22:49:48", "slug": "john-lansdown-and-the-genesis-of-computer-art", "speakers": [{"id": 4776, "name": "Dr Nick Lambert", "slug": "dr-nick-lambert"}], "topics": [{"id": 140, "name": "newmediaart", "path": "/arts/newmediaart"}, {"id": 97, "name": "science", "path": "/arts/science"}, {"id": 90, "name": "historyofart", "path": "/academic/historyofart"}, {"id": 441, "name": "computerscience", "path": "/academic/computerscience"}, {"id": 86, "name": "historyofart", "path": "/arts/historyofart"}, {"id": 518, "name": "computing", "path": "/science/computing"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 1178, "name": "Lansdown Centre for Electronic Arts", "slug": "lansdown-centre-for-electronic-arts", "city": "Barnet", "postcode": "EN4 8HT"}, "organizer": {"id": 1178, "name": "Lansdown Centre for Electronic Arts", "slug": "lansdown-centre-for-electronic-arts"}, "date": "2006-12-12", "dates": [{"id": 3938, "from_date": "2006-12-12", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "16:45:00", "ticket_cost": "free", "ticket_info": "If you would like to attend this lecture, please email LCEAinfo@mdx.ac.uk.", "additional_info": null, "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 1178, "name": "Lansdown Centre for Electronic Arts", "slug": "lansdown-centre-for-electronic-arts", "city": "Barnet", "postcode": "EN4 8HT"}, "organizer": {"id": 1178, "name": "Lansdown Centre for Electronic Arts", "slug": "lansdown-centre-for-electronic-arts"}}]}, {"id": 3728, "title": "Work, Rest & Play", "synopsis": "A talk discussing the themes, techniques and meanings of Work Rest and Play, the exhibition on show from the National Gallery in Bristol's City Museum & Art Gallery at this time.", "keywords": "Fine art\r\nNational Gallery\r\nWork", "body": "In a joint meeting with the Friends of Bristol Art Gallery, the paintings in Work, Rest & Play, the exhibition on show from the National Gallery in the Bristol City Museum & Art Gallery at this time, will be described.

Born in Martinique in 1951, he studied in France before moving back to his native island. During the 70s he became a militant proponent of use of the Creole language and later worked with Jean Bernabé and Patrick Chamoiseau to create the creolité movement. His works include major novels (Eau de Café, L’Allée des soupirs, La Panse du chacal), essays (Eloge de la créolité – In Praise of Creoleness, and Lettres Créoles with Patrick Chamoiseau) and memoirs (Ravines du devant-jour, Le Cahier de romances). He has been awarded many literary prizes (Prix Novembre, Prix Casa de las Americas). For this very exclusive appearance in London, Raphaël Confiant will discuss his work and his views on creoleness and post-colonialism with Pr.

The symmetry and shape of the snowflake crystal actually arises because of intermolecular forces, which control which way the water molecules pack. Many natural minerals, like diamond, often adopt characteristic 3D forms such as the octahedron, cube or far more complex shapes. Similarly, fabricated or synthesised crystals have distinctive shapes and it is this property that often determines their behaviour in many important everyday uses. For example, different shaped pharmaceutical crystals dissolve at distinct rates and this governs how quickly they can become active in the human body. By manipulating crystal shape, the activity and other properties can be changed at will. Using live experiments and demonstrations, Ben Slater and colleagues will discuss why materials adopt particular shapes and how computational models are being used to try and understand how to predict and control crystal shape, to make more useful materials.\r\n\r\nBen Slater is a senior research fellow at the Davy Faraday Research Laboratory (DFRL) and also lectures at the chemistry department at University College London.
