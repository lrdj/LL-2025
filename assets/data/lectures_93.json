What makes sex work “ethical”?\r\n\r\nForget everything you’ve heard about strippers: this talk is an antidote to stigma, shame and stereotyping. Stacey Clare has been part of the much maligned, misunderstood and misrepresented world of UK strip clubs since the age of 22. She opens-up about her work and experiences with this candid and critical perspective of the industry.\r\n\r\nYou already know the stereotypes. The strong, independent female who strips to support her own sumptuous lifestyle choices; the smart, sassy student who strips to pay her way through university, or the savvy immigrant who sends money to her family back home. Or what about the wayward party girl rebelling against her strict upbringing, or the single-mum raising her child with precious little in the way of resources?\r\n\r\nWhat about the Buddhist, stripper-turned-activist and public speaker with a fine art degree, who works part-time as a care assistant and has a passion for theatre, feminism and human rights? Heard about her yet?\r\n\r\nStacey is one of the fierce, feisty, phenomenal co-founder of East London Strippers Collective (strippers plural). She has been stripping for more than a decade, and has mastered the art of sexual entertainment. Before stripping, Stacey was a political rebel fighting for social justice and experiencing protest/direct action as a performance (in costume or character). As a fine art student, her work concentrated on performance art and theatre, and she still involves herself in community theatre projects that deal with projects that are close to her heart, including Sex Workers’ Opera (https://www.sexworkersopera.com/)\r\n\r\nHer book The Ethical Stripper is seeking crowd-funding on Unbound.", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 2756, "added": "2018-09-02T21:01:41", "slug": "aeac5c765e7b4e8e", "speakers": [{"id": 16847, "name": "Stacey  Clare", "slug": "stacey-clare"}], "topics": [{"id": 3413, "name": "feminism", "path": "/politics/feminism/womenshistory/feminism"}, {"id": 2849, "name": "work", "path": "/academic/economics/happiness/work"}, {"id": 2490, "name": "feminism", "path": "/society/gender/feminism/feminism"}, {"id": 3436, "name": "feminism", "path": "/society/history/17thcentury/feminism"}], "supercategory": "politics", "venue": {"id": 3439, "name": "Conway Hall Ethical Society", "slug": "conway-hall-ethical-society", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC1R 4RL"}, "organizer": {"id": 3439, "name": "Conway Hall Ethical Society", "slug": "conway-hall-ethical-society"}, "date": "2018-10-28", "dates": [{"id": 16804, "from_date": "2018-10-28", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "15:00:00", "ticket_cost": "£8 / £4 concessions", "ticket_info": "https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/thinking-on-sunday-the-ethical-stripper-tickets-48410471022", "additional_info": null, "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 3439, "name": "Conway Hall Ethical Society", "slug": "conway-hall-ethical-society", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC1R 4RL"}, "organizer": {"id": 3439, "name": "Conway Hall Ethical Society", "slug": "conway-hall-ethical-society"}}]}, {"id": 16087, "title": "500 years of medicine.

Along with a number of interesting points, their interaction exposes what has since become one of the key questions of the Platonic tradition: is what we call \"piety\" loved by the gods because it is pious, or is \"piety\" pious simply because it is loved by the gods?  What is it that draws us toward the sacred, the sacred itself? or what we think the gods/God/others are drawn to as sacred? We'll spend some time discussing this subtle question, called the \"Euthyphro dilemma\", and try to translate it into language that appeals to more modern sensibilities.  Along the way, we'll see how this question opens a door to the whole Platonic worldview and get a glimpse of how much Platonism influenced subsequent religious ideas. \r\n\r\nNo previous experience of formal philosophy is required.\r\n\r\nEntrance in free, but donations between £3-5 will be welcomed.\r\n\r\nA PDF download of the extract we will be reading is available on our website together with further details of this and other Prometheus Trust's activities: www.prometheustrust.co.uk (the PDF is on the \"London Monday Evenings\" page.)", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 2100, "added": "2017-10-09T09:52:13", "slug": "7037e9a5a159fdc3", "speakers": [{"id": 16647, "name": "Stuart  Dunbar", "slug": "stuart-dunbar"}], "topics": [{"id": 1822, "name": "philosophy", "path": "/academic/religion/religion/philosophy"}, {"id": 2388, "name": "philosophy", "path": "/arts/literature/philosophy/philosophy"}, {"id": 365, "name": "platonism", "path": "/arts/philosophy/platonism"}, {"id": 316, "name": "philosophy", "path": "/arts/art/philosophy"}], "supercategory": "academic", "venue": {"id": 3106, "name": "Cecil Sharp House", "slug": "cecil-sharp-house", "city": "London", "postcode": "NW1 7AY"}, "organizer": {"id": 2041, "name": "The Prometheus Trust", "slug": "the-prometheus-trust"}, "date": "2017-11-06", "dates": [{"id": 16522, "from_date": "2017-11-06", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "19:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Donation", "ticket_info": "no need to book", "additional_info": null, "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 3106, "name": "Cecil Sharp House", "slug": "cecil-sharp-house", "city": "London", "postcode": "NW1 7AY"}, "organizer": {"id": 2041, "name": "The Prometheus Trust", "slug": "the-prometheus-trust"}}]}, {"id": 15926, "title": "Eimear McBride", "synopsis": "Eimear McBride joins the Irish Literary Society to discuss and read from her work.

The Ednams became a dynamic couple of the Bright Young Things era of the 1920s, but in July, 1930 at the peak of their chaotic life together, Rosemary met her sudden death in a horrific aeroplane crash, which also killed three of her fellow aristocrats. The unexplained accident (which remains unsolved even today) caused giant ripples across the whole of British Society. Rumours were rife of sabotage, especially as it was said that Edward, Prince of Wales, had only just escaped death in the same crash by changing his travel plans at the last minute. Will Cross (author of several biographies on the British gentry) unravels Rosemary’s life and times and offers some startling and sinister facts about the aftermath of her tragic death. An illustrated talk. Will Cross is working on a book about Rosemary and her brother Alistair ( who also died mysteriously). Both Rosemary and Alastair Leveson-Gower were friends of Gwyneth Morgan, the wayward daughter of Courtenay, Lord Tredegar. This is another largely untold Society tale that raises disturbing issues, even now, over eighty years on.\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 120, "image_id": 2181, "added": "2016-04-04T21:33:22", "slug": "d5150daf38b0e4fc", "speakers": [{"id": 13766, "name": "Mr William  Cross", "slug": "mr-william-cross"}], "topics": [{"id": 3233, "name": "prince", "path": "/arts/music/popular/prince"}, {"id": 4202, "name": "wales", "path": "/leisure/familyhistory/wales"}, {"id": 3359, "name": "wales", "path": "/society/wales"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 2971, "name": "Probus Club of Llandaff,", "slug": "probus-club-of-llandaff", "city": "Llandaff, Cardiff", "postcode": "CF5 2BY"}, "organizer": {"id": 2861, "name": "William Cross, FSA Scot", "slug": "william-cross-fsa-scot"}, "date": "2016-04-14", "dates": [{"id": 15831, "from_date": "2016-04-14", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "10:00:00", "ticket_cost": "Probus Members only", "ticket_info": "Probus Members Only", "additional_info": "William Cross, FSA Scot is the author or FIVE books on the Carnarvons of Highclere Castle, the backdrop to TV's Downton Abbey and SIX books on members of the Morgan family of Tredegar House,, Newport, South Wales", "members_only": "Yes", "members_info": "Probus Members Only and Guests", "venue": {"id": 2971, "name": "Probus Club of Llandaff,", "slug": "probus-club-of-llandaff", "city": "Llandaff, Cardiff", "postcode": "CF5 2BY"}, "organizer": {"id": 2861, "name": "William Cross, FSA Scot", "slug": "william-cross-fsa-scot"}}]}, {"id": 15277, "title": "A Modernist in Exile: The International Reception of H.G.

But he only used the phrase three times in his writings. And none of the uses reflect what the phrase has come to mean today--a justification of laissez-faire capitalism. Yet Smith is indeed a key figure in the idea of emergent order--order that is the result of human action but not human design. Ironically, his richest explanation of that concept may be found in his little-known masterpiece, 'The Theory of Moral Sentiments'. His application there is not to our economic system, but to the very idea of civilization and culture. This talk explores Smith's concept of emergent order and its relevance for our conduct today and its potential to let all of us help to make the world a better place.\r\n\r\nRussell Roberts (@EconTalker), author of 'How Adam Smith Can Change Your Life', is a research fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution and the host of EconTalk, a weekly hour-long award-winning podcast.

Instead, he suggested, it was a powerful conceptual tool, one that played an important role in helping many people make sense of the complex world they lived in.  In this lecture he will explain how Anti-Judaism became so central, and describe some of the work it has done in shaping the ways in which past peoples interpreted the worlds they lived in.\r\n\r\nA brief Biography\r\nDavid Nirenberg is Deborah R. and Edgar D. Jannotta Professor of Medieval History and Social Thought at the University of Chicago, and the director of the university’s Neubauer Collegium for Culture and Society.  His research focuses on the ways in which Jewish, Christian, and Islamic societies have interacted with and thought about each other over the ages.  His books on the subject include Communities of Violence: Persecution of Minorities in the Middle Ages, as well as Judaism and Christian Art.  His recent book Anti-Judaism: The Western Tradition (2013) traces the multiple ways in which thinking about Jews and Judaism has shaped Christian, Islamic, and modern secular thought.  His Neighboring Faiths: Christianity, Islam, and Judaism Medieval and Modern, will appear in 2014.  David Nirenberg is also a contributor to publications such as The Nation, The New Republic, and The London Review of Books.\r\n\r\nAdmission is free but places must be reserved in advance.\r\n\r\nBooking link:  www.davidnirenberg2014.eventbrite.co.uk\r\n", "additional_info": null, "duration": 120, "image_id": null, "added": "2014-02-19T17:25:03", "slug": "e1648aaacdb4673d", "speakers": [{"id": 14509, "name": "Professor David Nirenberg", "slug": "professor-david-nirenberg"}], "topics": [{"id": 440, "name": "all", "path": "/science/all"}], "supercategory": "science", "venue": {"id": 2936, "name": "Arts Two Lecture Theatre", "slug": "arts-two-lecture-theatre", "city": "London", "postcode": "E1 4NS"}, "organizer": {"id": 2598, "name": "Leo Baeck Institute", "slug": "leo-baeck-institute"}, "date": "2014-03-13", "dates": [{"id": 13984, "from_date": "2014-03-13", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "18:30:00", "ticket_cost": "FREE", "ticket_info": "Admission is free but places must be reserved in advance.\r\n\r\nBooking link:  www.davidnirenberg2014.eventbrite.co.uk\r\n\r\n\r\nFor further information or updates on this event please refer to\r\nThe Leo Baeck Institute\twww.leobaeck.co.uk\r\nEmail\tinfo@leobaeck.co.uk\r\nPhone\t+44 20 7882 5690/ 5689)\r\n", "additional_info": null, "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 2936, "name": "Arts Two Lecture Theatre", "slug": "arts-two-lecture-theatre", "city": "London", "postcode": "E1 4NS"}, "organizer": {"id": 2598, "name": "Leo Baeck Institute", "slug": "leo-baeck-institute"}}]}, {"id": 13435, "title": "The Sacred Art of Mongolia", "synopsis": "Lecture by Zara Fleming", "keywords": "Mongolia, Art", "body": "This lecture examines the charming and beautiful art of Mongolia", "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": null, "added": "2014-01-24T14:47:00", "slug": "ce1b6cdc534f9043", "speakers": [{"id": 14459, "name": "Ms Zara Fleming", "slug": "ms-zara-fleming"}], "topics": [{"id": 3632, "name": "mongolia", "path": "/religion/buddhism/mongolia"}], "supercategory": "religion", "venue": {"id": 331, "name": "Grosvenor Museum", "slug": "grosvenor-museum", "city": "Chester", "postcode": "CH1 2DD"}, "organizer": {"id": 331, "name": "Grosvenor Museum", "slug": "grosvenor-museum"}, "date": "2014-05-27", "dates": [{"id": 13933, "from_date": "2014-05-27", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "19:30:00", "ticket_cost": "£4", "ticket_info": null, "additional_info": "Grosvenor Museum Lecture Theatre", "members_only": "No", "members_info": "£4 pay on the door if a non member. £2 students with a valid card.

This lecture will focus on the gender politics of this process: the gender text, and sub-text, of the goals themselves, the extent to which gender advocates and activists were involved in the formulation of the goals, how the goals relate to previous gender-related commitments of the international community, including the Beijing Platform for Action and the Vienna Declaration on human rights and what has been achieved so far.

This lecture will describe an unusually short DNA sequence, just two base pairs long, CG, which occurs in several chemically different forms. Defects in signalling by CG are implicated in disease. For example, the autism spectrum disorder Rett syndrome is caused by loss of a protein that reads methylated CG and affects the activity of genes.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Society GlaxoSmithKline Prize Lecture is awarded for original contributions to medical and veterinary sciences published within ten years from the date of the award.\r\n\r\nThis event is free to attend and open to all.

This unusual award recognised his work on behalf of the SMF in the many areas where religious bodies seek to interfere with other people's bodies.\r\n\r\nAway from the SMF, Antony lives with his family in rural Shropshire where he can indulge in some of his other passions, outdoor swimming, cycling, tennis and a quiet family life.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe SMF actively campaigns to limit the harm caused to patients by the imposition of other people's religious beliefs, focussing on the principles of equality, adult autonomy and child protection where they conflict with traditional religious privileges and prejudices in areas such as sex and relationship education, attitudes to homosexuality, access to abortion services, chaplaincy services, assisted dying and forced genital cutting.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe evening will start at the usual time of 6.30 p.m. in the Falkender Room and after Antony's lecture there will be a short question and answer session before we retire to a local pub for further debate around 8.00 p.m.", "additional_info": null, "duration": 60, "image_id": null, "added": "2012-04-05T10:40:08", "slug": "2cd2a3c41e172bf7", "speakers": [{"id": 12244, "name": "Dr Antony Lempert", "slug": "dr-antony-lempert"}], "topics": [{"id": 1397, "name": "medicine", "path": "/academic/science/philosophy/engineering/biology/medicine"}, {"id": 170, "name": "newtopic", "path": "/science/chemistry/biochemistry/catalysis/newtopic"}, {"id": 910, "name": "science", "path": "/arts/film/documentary/science"}, {"id": 1823, "name": "science", "path": "/academic/religion/religion/science"}], "supercategory": "academic", "venue": {"id": 2661, "name": "Falkender Room, Commonwealth Hall", "slug": "falkender-room-commonwealth-hall", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC1H 9EB"}, "organizer": {"id": 2560, "name": "EdwardPresswood.com", "slug": "edwardpresswoodcom"}, "date": "2012-04-25", "dates": [{"id": 11446, "from_date": "2012-04-25", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "18:30:00", "ticket_cost": "Suggested donation £2", "ticket_info": "On the door", "additional_info": "http://www.meetup.com/Central-London-Humanists/events/47864752/", "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 2661, "name": "Falkender Room, Commonwealth Hall", "slug": "falkender-room-commonwealth-hall", "city": "London", "postcode": "WC1H 9EB"}, "organizer": {"id": 2560, "name": "EdwardPresswood.com", "slug": "edwardpresswoodcom"}}]}, {"id": 10978, "title": "Strategies for commercial success of biosimilars in an increasingly crowded market place ", "synopsis": "This Euroscicon biosimilars conference will focus on multiple aspects of biosimilar product development to successfully deliver safe, biosimilar products to the market place.", "keywords": "biopharmaceutical, drug delivery, Biosimilar, Regulatory, CMC,EU, Product registration, Biosimilars, Biologicals, Regulatory, Monoclonal antibodies, process development, automation, cell line, bioreactor, Characterisation, Biosimilarity, Comparability\r\n", "body": "Whilst biopharmaceuticals remain a major component of the global therapeutics market, the ever expanding portfolio of products losing patent protection and with increasing healthcare costs remaining a poignant issue, the opportunity for development of competing, follow on biologics remains an attractive proposition for both Biotech and Pharma companies alike.

Such a question leads us to ask why students have to take so many GCSEs, English language exams, A levels, vocational assessments and so on. This seminar seeks to describe the part that examinations play in modern societies. Are they part of a widespread system of rules and regulations which constrain individuals? Or are they a route to new opportunities which lead to growth and self-fulfillment? Those who are working in the field of assessment might see themselves as trying to balance the tensions which pull in each of these directions. This seminar will be an opportunity to address such issues in the light of current discussions about educational assessment. \r\n\r\nThis seminar is part of the Assessment Principles series of seminars presented by Andrew Watts, a Principal Consultant for the Cambridge Assessment Network Division. The series focuses on five key topics in assessment: the purposes of assessment; the relationship between assessment and learning; the development of assessments; the validity and the reliability of assessments. Each session addresses one of these topics. Though the topics are the same each year, up-to-date issues are discussed which focus on recent news stories or which represent the latest thinking in that area. The series is for those who want to take a broad view of the field of educational assessment, in company with others working in the field. Participants will be able to share their own experiences and perceptions, and to reflect on those of others. A certificate is awarded for attendance at all five sessions (contact the Network team for details).\r\n\r\nDates for 2012 are:\r\n\r\n8 March: What is the purpose of public assessments (Cambridge)\r\n12 April: What is the purpose of public assessments (Coventry)\r\n10 May: How can assessment support learning?

Young people born since the Thatcher years can’t afford a house, they protest. Even the top graduates can’t get jobs that pay well and they think politics - voting or protesting - is pointless. Their parents, born of the post-war boom, received free education and jobs for life. ‘Britain’s young people are insecure, unstable and poor, (while) their parents are the richest generation ever to have lived and they have flatly failed to share the wealth,’ argue twenty-something journalists Ed Howker and Shiv Malik. Their book Manifesto for the Jilted Generation describes how the Baby Boomer generation, ‘seemingly squandered a nation’s communal wealth, turned their backs on society and broke all barriers in a lifelong quest to express themselves’. Gen Y writer Neil Boorman is even more blunt in blaming the boomers, calling his manifesto It’s all their fault.\r\n\r\nIt is argued that the postwar generation abolished the stop-go economy and created the knowledge economy, but gave the young stop-go lives and will charge them for their knowledge. It appears that politicians who need Baby Boomers’ votes encouraged speculation on property and locked the young out of ownership. They pushed post-retirement working while millions of young people remained unemployed. The jilted generation’s politically engaged parents outnumber them, and politicians are skewing policy in their favour. Even some Boomers have started to wake up to what they have done. Conservative minister David Willetts outlined in The Pinch: how the baby-boomers stole their children’s future how the time has come for his generation to bear the brunt of the austerity measures caused by their own fecklessness, while Boomer author Francis Beckett asks in his latest book, What Have The Boomers Ever Done For Us?. \r\n\r\nCan we really blame one generation for the troubles of the next? Have the Boomers really squandered their children’s future, or have Generation Y been spoiled with expectations of home ownership and material comfort which their parents could only have dreamed of?

Many of the techniques used to create these illusions share similarities with topics investigated by psychologists. For example, magicians use misdirection to systematically orchestrate people’s attention so as to manipulate what they see. Misdirection may therefore provide us with valuable insights into visual attention and awareness. Alternatively, magicians may manipulate our perception through the use of illusions, which may provide insights into the effects of top-down processing on perception. In this talk I will draw parallels between magic and science, and demonstrate how these principles can be investigated scientifically. These studies have particularly highlighted the role of the magician’s social cues (i.e., gaze direction) in manipulating attention. I will also present eye-tracking data from the “vanishing ball illusion”, in which the magician’s gaze direction played a pivotal role in creating expectations that resulted in people perceiving an event that never took place.\r\n\r\nIn the final part I will demonstrate how this approach can be used to investigate atypicalities in visual processing in clinical populations. In the vanishing ball illusion, the magician’s social cues misdirect the audience’s expectations and attention into ‘seeing’ a ball vanish in the air. As individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) are less sensitive to social cues, and have superior perception for non-social details, we predicted that they should be less susceptible to the illusion shown in a video-clip. Surprisingly, the opposite result was found, as individuals with ASD were more susceptible to the illusion than a comparison group. Eye-tracking data indicated that subtle temporal delays in allocating attention might explain their heightened susceptibility. Additionally, although ASD individuals showed typical patterns of looking to the magician's face and eyes, they were slower to launch their first saccade to the face, and had difficulty in fixating the fast moving observable ball. Considered together, the results indicate difficulties in the rapid allocation of attention towards both people and moving objects.\r\n\r\nGustav Kuhn completed his PhD at Sussex University in 2003, where he investigated implicit learning of musical structures, supervised by Zoltan Dienes. Towards the end of his PhD he started to collaborate with Michael Land and Benjamin Tatter by exploring the ways in which magicians can misdirect peoples’ attention. This was largely possible since, prior to his academic career, Gustav worked as a professional magician. It was at this point where he discovered the potential of using magic as a method for investigating a wide variety of cognitive processes. The focus of his research then naturally changed toward visual perception. In 2005 Gustav moved to Durham to work on a 1-year post doc investigating attentional capture, after which he was awarded a 3-year Wolfson fellowship enabling him to continue his research on the science of magic and in particular focusing on the way in which our attention is influenced by where others are looking. In 2009 he took up a position as a lecturer at Brunel University where he is currently teaching research methods.

In both instances, this thinking style has been related to an attenuated left hemispheric dominance for language, and a consecutive disinhibition of remote associative processing in the right hemisphere. While this right hemisphere contribution to language processing in the patient population might impinge normal conversational capacities, the same processes in the general population might facilitate creative thinking. Studies using neuropharmacological manipulations (dopamine agonistic treatment) support the view that magical belief in the general population is not simply on the continuum to psychosis, but might reflect a well-adapted personality dimension showing evolutionary advantages.\r\n\r\n\r\nChristine Mohr did her PhD on the “neuropsychology of magical belief” at the University of Zurich, Switzerland, and has continued working in this field ever since.

With respect to paranormal belief, she mainly investigates and publishes on the neuropsychological correlates of these beliefs, and aims to understand why some individuals with such “bizarre” beliefs are considered by most as absolutely healthy (but spiritual), while in others it is considered pathological (psychotic).

Described by Wikipedia as \"Second only to Robert Ettinger as one of the most influential figures in the controversial field of cryonics\".\r\n\r\nThe talk will draw on the speaker's extensive personal experience with cryonics - the low-temperature preservation of humans and other animals that can no longer be sustained by contemporary medicine, until such time in the future when resuscitation may be possible.\r\n\r\nThe talk will cover: the audacious ambition and vision of cryonics, practical details of how it works, a whistle-stop history of cryonics, issues with the governance of cryonics organisations, factors influencing public perception of cryonics, and reasons for both fear and hope for the future of cryonics.\r\n\r\nSpecial attention will be given to the decline of cryonics in the UK and the failure of UK cryonics to establish a robust, full-service beachhead in Britain. The talk will also highlight what can be done to re-establish cryonics in the UK as a stable enterprise that will deserve the confidence of both its members and the public as a competent, high quality undertaking offering services which meet the highest ethical, scientific and biomedical standards.\r\n\r\nThe meeting is sponsored by the UK Transhumanist Association.

Zoological nomenclature is now administered with a comprehensive set of rules by the International Commission of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN). Taxonomy increasingly relies on electronic forms of communication, and open access is essential for this information to be really useful. Molecular data are vital in the field of phylogenetics, and molecular methods – from nucleotides to amino acids, and the current Barcode of Life initiative – are set to increase in importance in other areas of taxonomy. Each year about 15,000-20,000 animals are named and described.

It will also answer the important ethical question: what does this mean for mans relationship with animals?  \r\n\r\nCombining rigorous evidence, elegant argument and amusing anecdote, leading animal-behaviour researcher Dr Jonathan Balcombe, from the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, will be joined by Dr Gill Langley, from the Dr Hadwen Trust, and other experts to debate the issue.  \r\n", "keywords": "Animals,debate,discussion,science", "body": null, "additional_info": null, "duration": 90, "image_id": 129, "added": "2006-05-09T18:09:56", "slug": "ccef0d1db84dc437", "speakers": [{"id": 3917, "name": "TBC", "slug": "tbc"}], "topics": [{"id": 170, "name": "newtopic", "path": "/science/chemistry/biochemistry/catalysis/newtopic"}, {"id": 942, "name": "debate", "path": "/arts/books/poetry/debate"}, {"id": 910, "name": "science", "path": "/arts/film/documentary/science"}, {"id": 169, "name": "catalysis", "path": "/science/chemistry/biochemistry/catalysis"}], "supercategory": "science", "venue": {"id": 15, "name": "Dana Centre", "slug": "dana-centre", "city": "London", "postcode": "SW7 5HE"}, "organizer": {"id": 46, "name": "Science Museum", "slug": "science-museum"}, "date": "2006-06-01", "dates": [{"id": 3183, "from_date": "2006-06-01", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "19:00:00", "ticket_cost": "FREE", "ticket_info": "Tickets are FREE but must be pre-booked on: 020 7942 4040 or tickets@danacentre.org.uk\r\n", "additional_info": null, "members_only": "No", "members_info": null, "venue": {"id": 15, "name": "Dana Centre", "slug": "dana-centre", "city": "London", "postcode": "SW7 5HE"}, "organizer": {"id": 46, "name": "Science Museum", "slug": "science-museum"}}]}, {"id": 3018, "title": "Sir Edwin Chadwick and the London dead", "synopsis": "This lecture will describe Chadwick's influence on government policy regarding cemeteries in the mid 19th century.", "keywords": "Chadwick cemeteries London ", "body": null, "additional_info": null, "duration": 60, "image_id": null, "added": "2006-04-29T22:26:06", "slug": "13d0a5afedb94707", "speakers": [{"id": 3890, "name": "Dr  Ruth Richardson", "slug": "dr-ruth-richardson"}], "topics": [{"id": 902, "name": "london", "path": "/arts/archaeology/london"}, {"id": 903, "name": "london", "path": "/academic/history/london"}, {"id": 80, "name": "society", "path": "/society"}], "supercategory": "arts", "venue": {"id": 760, "name": "Dissenters' Chapel, Kensal Green Cemetery", "slug": "dissenters-chapel-kensal-green-cemetery", "city": "London", "postcode": "W10 4SR"}, "organizer": {"id": 896, "name": "Friends of Kensal Green Cemetery", "slug": "friends-of-kensal-green-cemetery"}, "date": "2006-06-04", "dates": [{"id": 3160, "from_date": "2006-06-04", "to_date": "0000-00-00", "time": "17:00:00", "ticket_cost": "£3  (Friends £2)", "ticket_info": "On the door.", "additional_info": "Refreshments served from 4.30pm.

Brought to the surface in giant explosive eruptions, and mined from or washed out of the soft rock that surrounds them, they hold a special fascination, but just what is it that makes them a girl’s best friend? From its background as a mineral and material, to the fabulous jewellery that adorns some of the world’s most beautiful (and wealthy) people, to its uses and potential in industry and technology, Paul will trace the lifecycle of a diamond from deep within the Earth to the shop window, industrial synthesis and beyond. Did you know that scientists now make diamonds in the laboratory using high-pressure techniques that have been scaled up into an important industrial process to make materials for cutting and polishing hard rock and metals? Or that diamonds are also used by scientists as anvils to squeeze materials up to millions of atmospheres? Well see for yourself as Paul demonstrates the use of the diamond anvil cell, that lets scientists take a fascinating peek into the nature of dense matter. Samples of diamonds in their various stages/forms will be displayed in the Main Library for the audience to view both before and after the event, courtesy of the Diamond Trading Company.\r\n\r\nPaul F McMillan is Chair of Solid-State Chemistry at University College London, a post held jointly with the Royal Institution.

The exhibition has been designed for families to share their language experiences through video, animations, text, stories and interactives including a giant jigsaw and an art table.  Most importantly the exhibition also includes a display where you can add your own phrase or idiom, from English or your home language.\r\n\r\nThroughout the exhibition there will be a series of events that explore language in Hackney today, from the Jewish roots of Cockney rhyming slang to the Yoruba and English influences on a contemporary rap artist.

But do we really need them, or want them? The Dana Centre will tackle the issues surrounding the introduction of Identity Cards in a public debate. The introduction of cards aims to create a sense of shared citizenship and belonging. They will also help ensure that government services are only by used by those entitled to them and tackle problems faced by society today. However, just how reliable and accurate are they in identifying individuals and how will we prevent fraud and identity theft?   Will identity cards infringe on our civil liberties or will they successfully tackle the problems at large in society?", "keywords": "civil liberties, technology, science, debate", "body": "Are identity cards a convenient extension of current identification documents or an infringement of civil liberties? Discuss your views with experts and campaigners from all sides.\r\n\r\nIdentity cards will be introduced in the UK within two years and, under current plans, will be compulsory by 2013. Experts hope that the cards will tackle crimes including terrorism, drug trafficking, identity theft and illegal immigration. But will they? According to a poll by Mori earlier this year, 80 per cent of the public are in favour of identity cards. Do you agree? This is your chance to discuss these issues and more with representatives from all sides.\r\n\r\nEach card will be a hi-tech smart card that will contain a computer chip, be machine-readable and record personal biometric information. Biometric information is a unique measure of some aspect of your body, such as your iris or fingerprint. Fingerprinting is the best known and most established type of biometric testing. Newer - and often more accurate - forms include iris scans, hand geometry, voice recognition and digitised images. Current identity card trials are using facial, iris and fingerprint identifiers.\r\n\r\nTo have an iris scan, for example, you have to peer into an infrared scanner, which records an image of one of your irises. This is then processed by dividing the image into hundreds of squares and measuring the light intensity in each one. These measurements are converted it into a string of digits - your 'biometric reference template' - and stored on a central database. When you need to prove your identity, a fresh scan is taken and processed, and the resulting data is matched to the stored reference template. If the two are sufficiently similar, your ID is authenticated.\r\n\r\nID cards have become 'smarter' as a result of the availability and lowered cost of tiny microprocessors suitable for wallet-sized cards. This technology allows multiple applications to be stored on the same tiny card.\r\n\r\nIt will not be compulsory to carry the card at all times, as in some countries, but if you're challenged you may be required to produce it within a few days. If you refuse to register for an identity card you could be fined up to £2500. You'll also have to pay for the card to be created in the first place.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of the cards aims to create a sense of shared citizenship and belonging. However, just how reliable and accurate are they in identifying individuals and how will we prevent fraud and identity theft?
