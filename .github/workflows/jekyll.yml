# GitHub Pages deployment via Actions for Jekyll
#
# How it works
# - Triggers on push to main and manual runs (workflow_dispatch)
# - build job:
#   • Checks out code
#   • Sets up Ruby (with Bundler cache)
#   • Configures GitHub Pages (id: pages) to obtain the base_path output
#   • Builds the site with Jekyll, passing --baseurl to match the Pages path
#   • Uploads the generated _site as an artifact
# - deploy job:
#   • Publishes the artifact to the GitHub Pages environment
